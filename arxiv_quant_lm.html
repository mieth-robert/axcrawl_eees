            <h2>Composable Finite-Size Security of High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Kanitschar, Marcus Huber</p>
            <p>Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) extending beyond urban areas commonly use satellite links. However, the transmission of quantum states through the Earth's atmosphere is highly susceptible to noise, restricting its application primarily to nighttime. High-dimensional (HD) QKD offers a promising solution to this limitation by employing high-dimensionally entangled quantum states. Although experimental platforms for HD QKD exist, previous security analyses were limited to the asymptotic regime and have either relied on impractical measurements or employed computationally demanding convex optimization tasks restricting the security analysis to low dimensions. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a composable finite-size security proof against both collective and coherent attacks for a general HD QKD protocol that utilizes only experimentally accessible measurements. In addition to the conventional, yet impractical `one-shot' key rates, we also provide a practical variable-length security argument that yields significantly higher expected key rates. This approach is particularly crucial for rapidly changing and turbulent atmospheric conditions, as encountered for free-space and satellite-based QKD platforms.</p>

            <h2>Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan B. Curtis, Amir Yacoby, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Scattering on Quantum Computers via Hamiltonian Truncation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Ingoldby, Michael Spannowsky, Timur Sypchenko, Simon Williams, Matthew Wingate</p>
            <p>We present a quantum computational framework using Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) for simulating real-time scattering processes in $(1+1)$-dimensional scalar $\phi^4$ theory. Unlike traditional lattice discretisation methods, HT approximates the quantum field theory Hilbert space by truncating the energy eigenbasis of a solvable reference Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of required qubits. Our approach involves preparing initial states as wavepackets through adiabatic evolution from the free-field theory to the interacting regime. We experimentally demonstrate this state preparation procedure on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum device and validate it through quantum simulations, capturing key phenomena such as wavepacket dynamics, interference effects, and particle production post-collision. Detailed resource comparisons highlight the advantages of HT over lattice approaches in terms of qubit efficiency, although we observe challenges associated with circuit depth scaling. Our findings suggest that Hamiltonian Truncation offers a promising strategy for quantum simulations of quantum field theories, particularly as quantum hardware and algorithms continue to improve.</p>

            <h2>Quantum CNOT Gate with Actively Synchronized Photon Pairs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haim Nakav, Tanim Firdoshi, Omri Davidson, Bankim Chandra Das, Ofer Firstenberg</p>
            <p>Controlling the synchronization of photons from probabilistic quantum sources plays a pivotal role in advancing efficient quantum information processing. We report the realization of a probabilistic entangling gate operating on actively synchronized photon pairs, using a quantum memory based on warm atomic vapor. We achieve a truth-table fidelity exceeding 85% and demonstrate Bell- inequality violation for all four Bell states. The reduction in visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference introduced by the storage process is identified as a primary factor limiting the gate fidelity. We derive an exact quantitative relation between HOM visibility and gate fidelity for pure single photons, which applies to all photonic gates relying on interference, regardless of the physical platform.</p>

            <h2>Nanoscale Mirrorless Superradiant Lasing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Bychek, Raphael Holzinger, Helmut Ritsch</p>
            <p>We predict collective 'free-space' lasing in a dense nanoscopic emitter arrangement where dipole-dipole coupled atomic emitters synchronize their emission and exhibit lasing behavior without the need for an optical resonator.~At the example of a subwavelength-spaced linear emitter chain with varying fractions of pumped and unpumped emitters, we present a comprehensive study of this mirrorless lasing phenomenon. The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge towards a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present. We show that this leads to superradiant lasing near the bare atomic frequency, making the system a promising candidate for a minimalist active optical frequency reference.</p>

            <h2>Unravelling the non-Markovian spin-boson model and quantum quasi-Otto cycle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreyas Harshal Pradhan, Hadi Mohammed Soufy, Vishal Anand, Rik Chattopadhyay, Subhadip Mitra, Samyadeb Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>We use the spin-boson model to describe the dynamics of a two-level atom interacting with Fabry-Pérot cavity modes. We solve the Schrödinger equation for the system-bath model without the Born-Markov approximation to derive the non-Markovian reduced dynamics of the qubit. We further construct an exact Lindblad-type master equation for it. Similar to the quantum Otto cycle, we construct a non- Markovian quasi-cyclic process based on the atom-cavity interactions, which we call the quasi-Otto cycle. For judicious choices of input state and parameters, the quasi-cycle can be more efficient as a quantum engine than the Otto cycle. We also showed that if the quasi-cycle is repeated multiple times, the efficiency of the quasi-Otto engine asymptotically approaches that of the Otto engine.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional photon blockade in cavity QED with parametric amplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madan Mohan Mahana, Sanket Das, Tarak Nath Dey</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the quantum-interference-induced photon blockade effect in a single two-level atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system with degenerate parametric am- plification. The analytical calculations reveal the optimal parametric gain and phase parameters for achieving optimum unconventional photon blockade conditions. Under the optimal parameter regime, the numerical results of the second-order correlation function demonstrate strong photon antibunching consistent with the analytical results. Furthermore, the numerical results corroborate that coherently driving the atom leads to a stronger photon blockade than a coherently driven cavity with the optimal parameters. We numerically demonstrate that the UPB effect is compromised by a non-zero cavity-atom coupling in the cavity-driven configuration. However, stronger photon an- tibunching can be attained with a non-zero cavity-atom coupling in the atom-driven configuration. This work may be suitable for experimentally realising a strongly antibunched single-photon source for applications in quantum technology.</p>

            <h2>Generic Two-Mode Gaussian States as Quantum Sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritam Chattopadhyay, Saikat Sur, Jonas F. G. Santos</p>
            <p>Gaussian quantum channels constitute a cornerstone of continuous-variable quantum information science, underpinning a wide array of protocols in quantum optics and quantum metrology. While the action of such channels on arbitrary states is well-characterized under full channel knowledge, we address the inverse problem, namely, the precise estimation of fundamental channel parameters, including the beam splitter transmissivity and the two-mode squeezing amplitude. Employing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a benchmark for metrological sensitivity, we demonstrate that the symmetry inherent in mode mixing critically governs the amplification of QFI, thereby enabling high-precision parameter estimation. In addition, we investigate quantum thermometry by estimating the average photon number of thermal states, revealing that the transmissivity parameter significantly modulates estimation precision. Our results underscore the metrological utility of two-mode Gaussian states and establish a robust framework for parameter inference in noisy and dynamically evolving quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum refrigerator embedded in spin-star environments: Scalings of temperature and refrigeration time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sukrut Mondkar, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We examine a quantum absorption refrigerator that comprises three qubits, each of which is connected with a separate spin-star environment. The refrigerator exhibits the feature of transient cooling, i.e., lowering of the temperature of the first qubit in sufficiently small timescales. Since the spin-star environment is inherently non-Markovian in nature, steady-state cooling may or may not be achieved. A key advantage of our model is that the symmetries of the Hamiltonian enable a solution of the reduced density matrices of the refrigerator qubits, even in the presence of a large number (~50) of environmental spins. We derive the condition for autonomous refrigeration and analyze how the optimal cold qubit temperature scales with the number of bath qubits. We find a power law scaling towards a constant asymptotic value. We also find the scaling of the minimum time required for cooling as a function of the number of bath spins. Further, we scrutinize the heat currents associated with each of the three qubits.</p>

            <h2>Timescales, Squeezing and Heisenberg Scalings in Many-Body Continuous Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gideon Lee, Ron Belyansky, Liang Jiang, Aashish A. Clerk</p>
            <p>The continuous monitoring of driven-dissipative systems offers new avenues for quantum advantage in metrology. This approach mixes temporal and spatial correlations in a manner distinct from traditional metrology, leading to ambiguities in how one identifies Heisenberg scalings (e.g.~standard asymptotic metrics like the sensitivity are not bounded by system size). Here, we propose a new metric for continuous sensing, the optimized finite-time environmental quantum Fisher information (QFI), that remedies the above issues by simultaneously treating time and system size as finite resources. In addition to having direct experimental relevance, this quantity is rigorously bounded by both system size and integration time, allowing for a precise formulation of Heisenberg scaling. We also introduce two many-body continuous sensors: the high-temperature superradiant sensor, and the dissipative spin squeezer. Both exhibit Heisenberg scaling of a collective magnetic field for multiple directions. The spin squeezed sensor has a striking advantage over previously studied many-body continuous sensors: the optimal measurement achieving the full QFI does not require the construction of a complex decoder system, but can be achieved using direct photodetection of the cavity output field.</p>

            <h2>Mean-field Mixed Quantum-Classical Approach for Many-Body Quantum Dynamics of Exciton-Polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritha Ghosh, Arshath Manjalingal, Sachith Wickramasinghe, Saeed Rahmanian Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal</p>
            <p>In this work, we use a mixed quantum-classical (mean-field) many-body approach for simulating the quantum dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons beyond the single-excitation subspace. We combine the multitrajectory Ehrenfest approach, which propagates slow degrees of freedom classically, with the Gross-Pitaevskii method, which propagates fast degrees of freedom in a mean-field fashion. We use this mean-field many-body Ehrenfest approach to analyze how the phonon-induced dynamic disorder and the many-body interaction affect the incoherent and coherent dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons. We examine how the number of excitations and the strength of repulsive exciton-exciton interaction nonlinearly influence the transport, Fröhlich scattering and decoherence.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of Dirac-Landau polaritons via THz magnetoreflectivity spectroscopy, demonstrating strong coupling between cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells and optical cavity modes. We demonstrate efficient nonlinear electroluminescence, characterized by a strongly out-of-equilibrium polariton distribution dominated by emission from the upper polariton branches. Model calculations, based on the nonlinear dependence of the emission intensity and spectral narrowing with bias voltage, indicate a polariton occupancy per mode close to unity, with a significant contribution from stimulated polariton emission. These findings open promising prospects for the development of Dirac-Landau polariton condensates and low-threshold, tunable terahertz polariton lasers based on cyclotron emission.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Schwinger tunneling via engineering of virtual particle phases in vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D.D. Su, B.F. Shen, Q.Z. Lv</p>
            <p>An investigation into Schwinger pair production mechanisms is presented, demonstrating that vacuum tunneling processes can be effectively controlled through electromagnetic potential modulation while maintaining the strong ffelds in the interaction region. This challenges the conventional paradigm that attributes exclusive governance of Schwinger processes to localized ffeld intensities. Through comprehensive analysis of particle number, momentum spectra, and spatial distribution of created pairs, we establish that the observed modulation effects originate from electromagnetic potential - induced modiffcations to the quantum phase structure of virtual particles. This phenomenon reveals a profound connection between Schwinger tunneling dynamics and the geometric phase properties of the quantum vacuum state - a vacuum analogue to the Aharonov-Bohm effect in charged particle systems. This discovery not only advances our understanding of electromagnetic interactions in quantum vacuum but also opens up new experimental opportunities for realizing Schwinger tunneling processes with existing facilities.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Quantum Optics in a Bose-Hubbard Waveguide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Roccati</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between quantum emitters and guided photons in one-dimension. When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Probing mixed-state phases on a quantum computer via Renyi correlators and variational decoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Zhang, Timothy H. Hsieh, Yong Baek Kim, Yijian Zou</p>
            <p>Recent advances have defined nontrivial phases of matter in open quantum systems, such as many-body quantum states subject to environmental noise. In this work, we experimentally probe and characterize mixed-state phases on Quantinuum's H1 quantum computer using two measures: Renyi correlators and the coding performance of a quantum error-correcting code associated with the phase. As a concrete example, we probe the low-energy states of the critical transverse field Ising model under different dephasing noise channels. First, we employ shadow tomography to observe a newly proposed Renyi correlator in two distinct phases: one exhibiting power-law decay and the other long-ranged. Second, we investigate the decoding fidelity of the associated quantum error-correcting code using a variational quantum circuit, and we find that a shallow circuit is sufficient to distinguish the above-mentioned two mixed-state phases through the decoding performance quantified by entanglement fidelity. Our work is a proof of concept for the quantum simulation and characterization of mixed-state phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. Arrazola, P. Bertet, Y. Chu, P. Rabl</p>
            <p>We study a generic cavity QED setup under conditions where the coupling between the two-level systems and a single bosonic mode is significantly degraded by low-frequency noise. To overcome this problem, we identify pulsed dynamical decoupling strategies that suppress the effects of noise while still allowing for a coherent exchange of excitations between the individual subsystems. The corresponding pulse sequences can be further designed to realize either Jaynes-Cummings, anti-Jaynes-Cummings, or Rabi couplings, as well as different types of cavity-mediated interactions between the two-level systems. A detailed analysis of the residual imperfections demonstrates that this decoupling strategy can boost the effective cooperativity of the cavity QED system by several orders of magnitude and improve the fidelity of quantum-technologically relevant operations accordingly.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raul Alvarez-Mendoza, Lorenzo Uboldi, Ashley Lyons, Richard Cogdell, Giulio Cerullo, Daniele Faccio</p>
            <p>Classical time-resolved optical spectroscopy experiments are performed using sequences of ultrashort light pulses, with photon fluxes incident on the sample which are many orders of magnitude higher than real-world conditions corresponding to sunlight illumination. Here we overcome this paradigm by exploiting quantum correlations to perform time-resolved spectroscopy with entangled photons. Starting from spontaneous parametric down-conversion driven by a continuous-wave laser, we exploit the temporal entanglement between randomly generated signal/idler pairs to obtain temporal resolution, and their spectral entanglement to select the excitation frequency. We also add spectral resolution in detection, using a Fourier transform approach which employs a common-path interferometer. We demonstrate the potential of our entangled-photon streak camera by resolving, at the single-photon level, excitation energy transfer cascades from LH2 to LH1 in the photosynthetic membrane and disentangling the lifetimes of two dyes in a mixture. We show that time-resolved spectroscopy with quantum light can be performed without compromising measurement time, recording a fluorescence time trace in less than a minute even for samples with low quantum yield, which can be reduced to sub-second times with acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Our results provide a new approach to ultrafast optical spectroscopy, where experiments are performed under conditions comparable to real-world sunlight illumination.</p>

            <h2>Quantum correlations in entangled two-particle non-unitary quantum walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gene M. M. Itable, Francis N. C. Paraan</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of quantum correlations in two-particle discrete-time non-unitary quantum walks on a line with gain and loss. The two particles are initially prepared in a maximally entangled state and evolve independently. Using numerically exact calculations of position probability densities, average interparticle distance, entanglement entropy, and concurrence, we examine how dissipation and particle-exchange symmetry of the state (symmetric or antisymmetric) influence the resulting correlations. Notably, we find that the entanglement entropy of the antisymmetric state decays slower than that of the symmetric state at the exceptional point of the model. We also show that, in the antisymmetric state, the concurrence measured on the one-particle reduced density operator is unaffected by dissipation. Furthermore, we discuss how these correlations indicate quantum-to-classical transitions through the appearance of Gaussian position probability densities, sub-linear growth of average interparticle distance after a few steps, and decay of the entanglement entropy. On the other hand, the robustness of the qubit entanglement entropy can differentiate the model's topological phases better than in the one-particle quantum walk scenario.</p>

            <p>Indefinite causal orders have been shown to enable a precision of inverse square N in quantum parameter estimation, where N is the number of independent processes probed in an experiment. This surpasses the widely accepted ultimate quantum precision of the Heisenberg limit, 1/N. While a recent laboratory demonstration highlighted this phenomenon, its validity relies on postselection for it only accounted for a subset of the resources used. Achieving a true violation of the Heisenberg limit-considering photon loss, detection ineffciency, and other imperfections-remains an open challenge. Here, we present an ultrahigh-effciency quantum switch to estimate the geometric phase associated with a pair of conjugate position and momentum displacements embedded in a superposition of causal orders. Our experimental data demonstrate precision surpassing the global Heisenberg limit without artificially correcting for losses or imperfections. This work paves the way for quantum metrology advantages under more general and realistic constraints.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Decoherence of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> András Tárkányi, Viktor Ivády</p>
            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic-field dependent VB- spin decoherence in hexagonal boron nitrides: A first-principles study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaewook Lee, Hyunsu Kim, Huijin Park, Hosung Seo</p>
            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN operates as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. To further advance the spin into a versatile qubit platform, it is imperative to understand its spin decoherence precisely, which is currently one of the major limiting factors for the VB- spin. In this study, we employ a first-principles quantum many-body simulation to investigate the decoherence of the VB- spin in dense nuclear spin baths as a function of magnetic field from 100 G to 3 T, revealing several unique phenomena and their origin. We found that decoherence mechanism changes at a specific magnetic field, which we refer to as the transition boundary (TB). Below the TB, the decoherence occurs within submicrosecond and it is primarily governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics. Above the TB, pair-wise flip-flop transitions become the dominant decoherence source, leading to the decoherence time of tens of microseconds. Building upon this understanding, we developed a method to predict the TB depending on the isotopic composition of h-BN, leading to TBs at 5020 G for h-10B14N and 2050 G for h-11B14N, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. We show that the larger TB in h-10BN derives from the larger nuclear spin of 10B than that of 11B, giving rise to strong nuclear modulation effects over a wider range of magnetic field in 10BN than in 11BN. We also explain the microscopic origin of several unique features in the decoherence, such as magnetic-field insensitive fast modulation found below the TB. Our results provide essential insight on the role of the 100% dense nuclear spin environment with large nuclear spins in the VB- decoherence, opening a new avenue for advancing the spin qubit in h-BN as robust platform in quantum information science.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Quantum States Trigger Emission in Nonlinear Photonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Qi Li, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Light-matter interactions are traditionally governed by two fundamental paradigms: spontaneous and stimulated radiation. However, in nonlinear multi-photon regimes, these classical mechanisms break down, revealing new possibilities for light emission. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mechanism, termed triggered emission, in which an emitter, largely detuned from single-photon states, is triggered by the quantum state of the environment to emit a highly correlated photon pair, doublon. By identifying two critical conditions, energy matching and wavefunction overlap, we demonstrate that the dynamics of the emitter are profoundly shaped by the environment's quantum state. Using this framework, we construct a novel superposition state comprising a localized single-photon state and a propagating, strongly correlated two-photon wavepacket. Furthermore, we realize the multi-photon unidirectional emission by modulating the emitter and the photon state. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear emitter dynamics but also provide a versatile platform for quantum computing and quantum information processing.</p>

Here, we study the stability of these protocols against Hamiltonian characterization errors. For this, we bound the maximum separation between the target and the implemented Hamiltonians. Additionally, we obtain an upper bound for the deviation in the expected value of an observable. We further propose a protocol for mitigating calibration errors which resembles dynamical-decoupling techniques. These results open the possibility of scaling digital-analog to intermediate and large scale systems while having an estimation on the errors committed.</p>

            <p>Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</p>

            <h2>Electrically Reconfigurable NbOCl$_2$ Metasurface for Quantum Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar A. M. Abdelraouf</p>
            <p>Entangled photon-pair sources are foundational to advancing quantum technologies, including secure communication, quantum sensing, and imaging. For deployment in space-constrained environments such as satellite-based quantum networks or portable devices, compact, reconfigurable, and efficient entanglement sources are essential. Here, we present an electrically tunable entangled photon-pair source utilizing a nanostructured NbOCl$_2$ crystal, engineered for operation in the telecommunication C-band. The inherent non-centrosymmetric lattice symmetry of NbOCl$_2$ enables direct generation of polarization-entangled Bell states without the need for post-selection, leveraging its exceptional second-order nonlinear susceptibility, which surpasses conventional nonlinear materials. By nanopatterning NbOCl$_2$ into a high-quality-factor metasurface, we achieve three orders of magnitude enhancement in photon-pair generation efficiency via resonant excitation of bound states in the continuum resonance, which intensify light-matter interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate in situ electrical tunability of the photon-pair emission wavelength over a 250 nm range from 1450 nm to 1700 nm by dynamically modulating surrounding liquid crystal layer. Remarkably, the decoupling of photon-pair generation rate and spectral tunability ensures high brightness, above 10,000 coincidences, under active tuning. The air stability and mechanical robustness of NbOCl$_2$ further enhance its practicality for real-world deployment. This work establishes NbOCl$_2$ as a superior material for scalable, on-chip quantum light sources, paving the way for integrated quantum communication systems, adaptive sensors, and portable quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast single-shot Floquet driving. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered multicolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kejie Fang, Elizabeth A. Goldschmidt</p>
            <p>Bell state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Lumia, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Jérôme Dubail, Mario Collura</p>
            <p>Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semra Gurtas Dogan, Kobra Hasanirokh, Omar Mustafa, Abdullah Guvendi</p>
            <p>This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieve a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here we combine capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and to be used for quantum information processing to largely overcome the issue of detection losses. While using the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $39\ \mathrm{nV}/\mathrm{cm}\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity we employ the inter-atomic dipolar interactions to execute an error-correction protocol, that protects sensing information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the idea of the protocol is based on introduction of additional non-linear lossy quantum channel, which results in enhancement of Fisher information by a factor of 3.3. The presented results open up a path towards broader usage of quantum-information-inspired error correction in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Towards an experimental implementation of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits: effect of detector gap variation on entanglement harvesting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Teixidó-Bonfill, Xi Dai, Adrian Lupascu, Eduardo Martín-Martínez</p>
            <p>Motivated by the prospect of experimental implementations of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits, we propose a model of variable-gap particle detector that aims to bridge some of the gaps between Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) models and realistic implementations. Using parameters tailored to potential experimental setups, we investigate entanglement harvesting in both spacelike-separated and causally connected scenarios. Our findings reveal that while variations in the energy gap reduce the ability to harvest entanglement for spacelike-separated detectors, detectors in causal contact can still become entangled through their interaction with the field. Notably, our analysis shows that (due to the derivative coupling nature of the model) even for causally connected detectors, the entanglement primarily originates from the field's correlations. This demonstrates the potential for genuine entanglement harvesting in the lab and opens the door to near-future entanglement harvesting experiments in superconducting circuits.</p>

Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.5 %.

            <p>One of the promises of quantum computing is to simulate physical systems efficiently. However, the simulation of open quantum systems - where interactions with the environment play a crucial role - remains challenging for quantum computing, as it is impossible to implement deterministically non-unitary operators on a quantum computer without auxiliary qubits. The Stinespring dilation can simulate an open dynamic but requires a high circuit depth, which is impractical for NISQ devices. An alternative approach is parallel probabilistic block-encoding methods, such as the Sz.-Nagy and Singular Value Decomposition dilations. These methods result in shallower circuits but are hybrid methods, and we do not simulate the quantum dynamic on the quantum computer. In this work, we describe a divide-and-conquer strategy for preparing mixed states to combine the output of each Kraus operator dilation and obtain the complete dynamic on quantum hardware with a lower circuit depth. The work also introduces a balanced strategy that groups the original Kraus operators into an expanded operator, leading to a trade-off between circuit depth, CNOT count, and number of qubits. We perform a computational analysis to demonstrate the advantages of the new method and present a proof-of-concept simulation of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson dynamic on current quantum hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangwei Long, Jianxin Zhong, Lijun Meng</p>
            <p>We systematic study numerical method into constructing a universal quantum gate set for topological quantum computation using SU(2)k anyon models. The values of F-symbols and R-symbols were computed through the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2), enabling precise determination of elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) for SU(2)k anyon systems. Quantum gates were subsequently derived from these EBMs through systematic implementations. One-qubit gates were synthesized using a genetic algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), while two-qubit gates were constructed through brute-force search or GA optimization to approximate local equivalence classes of the CNOT gate. Implementing this framework for SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 models successfully generated the canonical universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate}. Comparative benchmarking against the Fibonacci anyon model demonstrated that SU(2)5,6,7 implementations achieve comparable or superior fidelity in gate construction. These numerical results provide conclusive verification of the universal quantum computation capabilities inherent in SU(2)k anyon models. Furthermore, we get exact implementations of the local equivalence class [SWAP] using nine EBMs in each SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 configuration.</p>

In every case a single sender injects an energy E0 that is then deterministically and decrementally harvested by several remote receivers, confirming that energy introduced at one node can be redistributed among many entangled subsystems at light-speed-limited classical latency.

While conventional molecular representation methods face computational bottlenecks when processing high-dimensional data, quantum computing offers a promising alternative through its inherent parallelism and quantum superposition properties. We present a quantum circuit-based autoencoder architecture that maps SMILES molecular representations into quantum state space, employs parameterized quantum circuits for dimensional reduction, and utilizes SWAP tests to evaluate encoding quality. Theoretically, our approach preserves essential molecular features in exponentially smaller spaces while maintaining similarity relationships between molecules. Experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders effectively capture molecular structures and chemical properties. The proposed framework not only establishes a quantum pathway for molecular representation learning but also opens new possibilities for applications in drug discovery and materials design. As the first investigation at the intersection of molecular representation learning and quantum computing, this research lays both theoretical and practical foundations for the advancement of cheminformatics.</p>

            <p>Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</p>

            <p>The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and storage impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum nodes for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. In this paper, we analyse the quantum transduction from a communication perspective, by shedding the light on its fundamental role within quantum network design and deployment. This analysis reveals that there exist different types of transduction, including the one allowing a transducer to act as entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</p>

Compared with the previous proposal, the whole process of our proposal are in tunable way and the universal holonomic quantum qubit gates can be made robust to systematic error and decay which pushes the gate fidelities in the presence of decoherence and systematic error to well high level.

Unlike previous two-photon schemes, ours employs only one photon which interacts with the atoms twice - avoiding separate photon detections which causes irrecoverable probability loss. We present a detailed description and performance evaluation of our protocol under non-ideal conditions. High fidelity of 0.999 can be achieved with cavity cooperativity of only 34. Efficient state-carving paves the way for large-scale entanglement generation at cavity-interfaces for modular quantum computing, quantum repeaters and creating arbitrary shaped atomic graph states, essential for one-way quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mário G. Silveirinha, Daigo Oue</p>
            <p>Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.</p>

            <h2>Angular Momentum-Dependent Spectral Shift in Chiral Vacuum Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Based on a hybrid light-matter unitary transformation for cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate the spectral shift of an atom induced by quantum fluctuations in a chiral vacuum cavity. Remarkably, we find an intriguing angular momentum-dependent shift in the spectra of bound states. Our approach shows promise in going beyond traditional perturbative methods and demonstrates effectiveness even in the strong-coupling limit, as evidenced by our numerical benchmarks in the case of a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. In addition, we establish a cavity-interaction picture for calculating the chiral vacuum Rabi oscillation in the strong-coupling limit for a generic central potential. The anomalous spectral shift revealed in this study possesses both fundamental and practical significance and could be readily observed in experiments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum network-entanglement measures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Peng Xu, Julio I. de Vicente, Liang-Liang Sun, Sixia Yu</p>
            <p>Quantum networks are of high interest nowadays and a quantum internet has been long envisioned. Network-entanglement adapts the notion of entanglement to the network scenario and network-entangled states are considered to be a resource to overcome the limitations of a given network structure. In this work, we introduce measures of quantum network-entanglement that are well-defined within the general framework of quantum resource theories, which at the same time have a clear operational interpretation characterizing the extra resources necessary to prepare a targeted quantum state within a given network. In particular, we define the network communication cost and the network round complexity, which turn out to be intimately related to graph-theoretic parameters. We also provide methods to estimate these measures by introducing novel witnesses of network-entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Coherent State Assisted Entanglement Generation Between Quantum Memories</h2>

            <p>Generating entanglement deterministically at a capacity-approaching rate is critical for next-generation quantum networks. We propose weak-coherent-state-assisted protocols that can generate entanglement near-deterministically between reflective-cavity-based quantum memories at a success rate that exceeds the 50\% limit associated with single-photon-mediated schemes. The most pronounced benefit is shown in the low-channel-loss regime and persists even with moderate noise. We extend our protocols to entangle an array of memories in a GHZ state, and infer that it yields an exponential speed-up compared to previous single-photon-based protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Owen Ekblad</p>
            <p>In this note, we prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive unital Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac.</p>

            <p>In this paper, the ladder operators and a quantum-like approach are used to construct an operatorial version of a model dubbed crimo-taxis. In a classical framework, the crimo-taxis model is represented by reaction-diffusion partial differential equations describing a population divided into three interacting subgroups (ordinary citizens, drug users/dealers, and law enforcement personnel). In this new framework, the agents of the subgroups are modeled using annihilation, creation, and number fermionic operators, and their time evolution is assumed to be ruled by a Hermitian time-independent Hamiltonian operator suitable to capture the interactions among the subgroups. Furthermore, a recent extension of the standard Heisenberg view, namely $(\mathcal{H},\rho)$--induced dynamics, is also taken into account. Two scenarios, characterized by different initial spatial distributions of the subgroups, are considered. The results of some numerical simulations in a one--dimensional setting are presented and discussed.</p>

            <p>Most quantum computers today are constrained by hardware limitations, particularly the number of available qubits, causing significant challenges for executing large-scale quantum algorithms. Circuit cutting has emerged as a key technique to overcome these limitations by decomposing large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits that can be executed independently and later reconstructed. In this work, we introduce Qdislib, a distributed and flexible library for quantum circuit cutting, designed to seamlessly integrate with hybrid quantum-classical high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Qdislib employs a graph-based representation of quantum circuits to enable efficient partitioning, manipulation and execution, supporting both wire cutting and gate cutting techniques. The library is compatible with multiple quantum computing libraries, including Qiskit and Qibo, and leverages distributed computing frameworks to execute subcircuits across CPUs, GPUs, and quantum processing units (QPUs) in a fully parallelized manner. We present a proof of concept demonstrating how Qdislib enables the distributed execution of quantum circuits across heterogeneous computing resources, showcasing its potential for scalable quantum-classical workflows.</p>

            <p>Quantum games have attracted much attention in recent years due to their ability to solve decision-making dilemmas. The aim of this study is to extend previous work on quantum games by introducing a Mathematica package QEGS (Quantum Extension Game Solver) dedicated to the study of quantum extensions of classical $2\times2$ games based on the EWL scheme. The package generates all possible game extensions with one or two unitary strategies, which are invariant with respect to isomorphic transformations of the initial games. The package includes a number of functions to study these extensions, such as determining their Nash equilibria in pure strategies, eliminating dominated strategies, or computing maximin strategies. Independently of quantum extensions, these functions can also be used to analyze classical games. Reporting to a pdf is available. The discussion includes an outline of future research directions, such as the exploration of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and potential real-world applications in fields like quantum computing and secure communications.</p>

            <h2>Optomechanical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Margaret Pavlovich, Peter Rakich, Shruti Puri</p>
            <p>Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires single photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed into a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and for small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a single reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic sources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic outputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of resources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the all-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of quantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled states, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical quantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically long lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and insensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be prepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still probabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic modes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the states. The quantum states may be deterministically transferred from acoustic modes to optical modes, on demand, with another optical drive.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.</p>

            <p>Microwave drives are commonly employed to control superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit gates, readout, and parametric interactions. As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multi-photon pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multi-photon-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by both charge- and flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that drive-induced QP generation may impact novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving conditions.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Microwave-Optical Bell Pairs Generation for Quantum Transduction Using Kerr Nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangxin Li, Ming Yuan, Zhaoyou Wang, Changchun Zhong, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>Microwave-optical quantum transduction can be achieved via quantum teleportation using microwave-optical photon Bell pairs. The standard spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has to trade off between generation fidelity and probability due to unwanted higher-excitation pairs in the output. In this work, we propose a pulsed SPDC scheme that employs strong Kerr nonlinearity in the microwave mode. This nonlinearity causes significant detuning of higher excitations due to the anharmonicity of energy levels, and the system can be pulse-driven to produce single-photon pairs in the output. Our pulsed nonlinear approach can generate high-fidelity Bell pairs with high probability, alleviating the trade-off between fidelity and probability inherent in traditional SPDC schemes. We optimize both the pulse width and driving strength, demonstrating that our protocol outperforms the SPDC scheme in a realistic setting of finite nonlinearity and intrinsic photon loss.</p>

            <p>In contrast to the general argument that the spontaneous decay is intrinsically incoherent in nature and detrimental to quantum entanglement, here, we show that nearly perfect entanglement between two bright pump fields can be realized via spontaneous decay-induced destructive quantum interference in a closed double Lambda-type four-level atomic system with the energy separation of the excited doublet comparable to their decay rates. The high degree of bipartite entanglement results from the cancellation of spontaneous emission and subsequent elimination of the associated noise due to the destructive quantum interference between the two spontaneous emission pathways from the upper doublet to each of the two lower levels when the two strong pump fields are tuned to the particular frequencies where quantum interference takes place. This scheme is particularly suitable for the generation of entanglement between two bright light fields, and may find potential applications in realistic quantum information processing.</p>

By manipulating the dynamics of a superconducting qubit, we observe the full hierarchy of temporal quantum correlations. Moreover, we show that the rich dynamics of the temporal quantum correlations, such as sudden death or revival of temporal steering, provides a useful and unique measure for benchmarking qubits on a realistic circuit. Our work finds applications in identifying the casual structure in a quantum network, the non-Markovianity of open quantum systems, and the security bounds of quantum key distribution. As an example, we demonstrate the non-Markovianity of a single superconducting qubit on the quantum circuit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Ulanowski, Olivier Kuijpers, Benjamin Merkel, Adrian Holzäpfel, Andreas Reiserer</p>
            <p>Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.</p>

            <p>Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. Despite the success in the demonstration of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, there are almost no works on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) - an alternative process to generate photon pairs. Meanwhile, SFWM can be implemented in any nanostructures, including ones made of isotropic materials, which are easier to fabricate than crystalline SPDC sources. Here, we investigate photon pair generation through SFWM in subwavelength films of amorphous silicon nitride (SiN) with varying nitrogen content. For all samples, we demonstrate two-photon quantum correlations, indicated by the normalized second-order correlation function g(2)(0): it exceeds 2 and decays as the pump power increases. By observing two-photon interference between SFWM from the SiN films and the fused silica substrate, we find the third-order susceptibilities of films with different nitrogen content.</p>

In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to the state of the art. This is obtained by introducing an optimization method that leverages the quadratic dependence of the variational energy on the orbitals of each determinant, enabling an exact iterative optimization, and uses an efficient tensor-contraction algorithm to evaluate the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost that scales as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis.</p>

In this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19.

The top- and bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation, our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.</p>

            <p>Dual-rail erasure qubits can substantially improve the efficiency of quantum error correction, allowing lower error rates to be achieved with fewer qubits, but each erasure qubit requires $3\times$ more transmons to implement compared to standard qubits. In this work, we introduce a hybrid-erasure architecture for surface code error correction where a carefully chosen subset of qubits is designated as erasure qubits while the rest remain standard. Through code-capacity analysis and circuit-level simulations, we show that a hybrid-erasure architecture can boost the performance of the surface code -- much like how a game of Minesweeper becomes easier once a few squares are revealed -- while using fewer resources than a full-erasure architecture. We study strategies for the allocation and placement of erasure qubits through analysis and simulations. We then use the hybrid-erasure architecture to explore the trade-offs between per-qubit cost and key logical performance metrics such as threshold and effective distance in surface code error correction. Our results show that the strategic introduction of dual-rail erasure qubits in a transmon architecture can enhance the logical performance of surface codes for a fixed transmon budget, particularly for near-term-relevant transmon counts and logical error rates.</p>

            <p>We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 >1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.</p>

            <p>Matrix product states are useful representations for a large variety of naturally occurring quantum states.

We show that the usual ensemble of sequentially generated random matrix product states (RMPS) using local Haar random unitaries is not uniform when viewed as a restriction of the full Hilbert space. As a result, the entanglement across the chain exhibits an anomalous asymmetry under spatial inversion. We show how to construct an unbiased measure starting from the left-canonical form and design a Metropolis algorithm for sampling random states. Some properties of this new ensemble are investigated both analytically and numerically, such as the resulting resolution of identity over matrix product states and the typical entanglement spectrum, which is found to differ from the sequentially generated case.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
            <p>We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Coherently mitigating boson samplers with stochastic errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepesh Singh, Ryan J. Marshman, Nathan Walk, Jens Eisert, Timothy C. Ralph, Austin P. Lund</p>
            <p>Sampling experiments provide a viable route to show quantum advantages of quantum devices over classical computers in well-defined computational tasks. However, quantum devices such as boson samplers are susceptible to various errors, including stochastic errors due to fabrication imperfections. These cause the implemented unitary operations to deviate randomly from their intended targets, following distributions with finite variance. Whilst full-scale quantum error correction remains challenging in the near term, quantum error mitigation schemes have been devised to estimate expectation values, but it is unclear how these schemes would work for sampling experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that, given access to multiple stochastic unitaries, it is possible to mitigate the effect of these errors in sampling experiments. We adopt the unitary averaging protocol which employs multiple stochastic boson samplers to generate a distribution that approximates the ideal boson sampler distribution as the number of samplers increases. We derive a rigorous upper bound on the trace distance between the output probability distributions induced by invertible vacuum-heralded networks based on the Schur-Weyl duality. This result can be seen concretely as an error mitigation scheme in sampling experiments against stochastic errors. On a broader level, it suggests a path towards understanding error mitigation for sampling experiments and developing analysis tools for photonic circuits incorporating measurements and feed-forward. We further provide other applications of unitary averaging, including its use in implementing the linear combination of unitaries and benchmarking fabrication repeatability in linear optics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinxian Chen, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude-Lorentzian component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Toward Practical Quantum Machine Learning: A Novel Hybrid Quantum LSTM for Fraud Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rushikesh Ubale, Sujan K.K., Sangram Deshpande, Gregory T. Byrd</p>
            <p>We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of 45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of fraud detection systems.

            <h2>A New Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithm for Solving the Unit Commitment Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Willie Aboumrad, Phani R V Marthi, Suman Debnath, Martin Roetteler, Evgeny Epifanovsky</p>
            <p>Solving problems related to planning and operations of large-scale power systems is challenging on classical computers due to their inherent nature as mixed-integer and nonlinear problems. Quantum computing provides new avenues to approach these problems. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in power systems which aims at minimizing the total cost while optimally allocating generating units to meet the hourly demand of the power loads. The hybrid algorithm combines a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a classical Bender's type heuristic. The resulting algorithm computes approximate solutions to UC in three stages: i) a collection of UC vectors capable meeting the power demand with lowest possible operating costs is generated based on VQA; ii) a classical sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) routine is leveraged to find the optimal power level corresponding to a predetermined number of candidate vectors; iii) in the last stage, the approximate solution of UC along with generating units power level combination is given. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method, three different systems with 3 generating units, 10 generating units, and 26 generating units were tested for different time periods. In addition, convergence of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for select time periods is proven out on IonQ's Forte system.</p>

However, existing numerical models require solving a large set of coupled differential equations that is computationally intensive and lengthy to solve. We present an analytic approach that can be used to derive an impulse response function that allows up to two orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time compared to the full time-dependent integration of the equations of motion. This approach can be used to enable rapid assessments of the Rydberg sensor's response to various waveforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Feng Pan, Peng-Bo Li</p>
            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and superconducting qubits are two promising solid-state quantum systems for quantum science and technology, but the realization of controlled interfaces between individual solid-state spins and superconducting qubits remains fundamentally challenging. Here, we propose and analyze a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic skyrmion, an NV center, and a superconducting qubit, where the solid-state qubits are both positioned in proximity to the skyrmion structure in a thin magnetic disk. We show that it is experimentally feasible to achieve strong magnetic (coherent or dissipative) coupling between the NV center and the superconducting qubit by using the \textit{quantized gyration mode of the skyrmion} as an intermediary. This allows coherent information transfer and nonreciprocal responses between the NV center and the superconducting qubit at the single quantum level with high controllability. The proposed platform provides a scalable pathway for implementing quantum protocols that synergistically exploit the complementary advantages of spin-based quantum memories, microwave-frequency superconducting circuits, and topologically protected magnetic excitations.</p>

            <p>With the rapid scaling of superconducting quantum processors, electronic control systems relying on commercial off-the-shelf instruments face critical bottlenecks in signal density, power consumption, and crosstalk mitigation. Here we present a custom dual-channel direct current (DC) source module (QPower) dedicated for large-scale superconducting quantum processors. The module delivers a voltage range of $\pm$7 V with 200 mA maximum current per channel, while achieving the following key performance benchmarks: noise spectral density of 20 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 kHz, output ripple $<$500 $\mu$V$_{\mathrm{pp}}$ within 20 MHz bandwidth, and long-term voltage drift $<$5 $\mu$V$_{\mathrm{pp}}$ over 12 hours. Integrated into the control electronics of a 66-qubit quantum processor, QPower enables qubit coherence times of $T_1 = 87.6~\mu\mathrm{s}$ and Ramsey $T_2 = 5.1~\mu\mathrm{s}$, with qubit resonance frequency drift constrained to $\pm$40 kHz during 12-hour operation. This modular design is compact in size and efficient in energy consumption, providing a scalable DC source solution for intermediate-scale quantum processors with stringent noise and stability requirements, with potential extensions to other quantum hardware platforms and precision measurement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuya Fukuda, Masataka Iinuma, Yuto Matsumoto, Holger F. Hofmann</p>
            <p>It is generally assumed that the detection of a single photon as part of an interference pattern erases all possible which-path information. However, recent insights suggest that weak interactions can provide non-trivial experimental evidence for the physical delocalization of a single particle passing through an interferometer. Here, we present an experimental setup that can quantify the delocalization of individual photons using the rate of polarization flips induced by small rotations of polarization. The results show that photons detected in equal superpositions of the two paths are delocalized when detected in a high probability output port, and "super-localized" when detected in a low probability output port. We can thus confirm that delocalization depends on the detection of photons in the output of the interferometer, providing direct experimental evidence for the dependence of physical reality on the context established by a future measurement.</p>

            <p>Optically active quantum defects in solids, such as the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are a leading modality for micron-scale and nanoscale (ultralow-mass) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging under ambient conditions. However, the spin and optical properties of NV centers degrade when closer than about 10 nm from the diamond surface, limiting NMR sensitivity as well as spectral and spatial resolution. Here we outline efforts to develop an alternative nanoscale NMR sensor using the negatively charged boron vacancy ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). As a van der Waals material, hBN's surface is free from dangling bonds and other sources of paramagnetic noise that degrade the performance of near surface NVs, allowing stable $V_B^-$ defects to exist $\sim1\,$nm from the material surface. We discuss the properties of boron vacancies as they apply to narrowband (AC) magnetic field sensing and outline experimental designs optimized for this system. We propose measurement protocols for $V_B^-$ NMR for both statistically and uniformly polarized samples at the nano- and micron-scales, including relevant pulse sequences, sensitivity calculations, and sample confinement strategies; and compare the expected performance to NV-NMR. We estimate back-action effects between the $V_B^-$ electronic spins and the sample nuclear spins at the nanoscale; and account for unconventional diffusion dynamics in the flow-restricted nanoscale regime, calculating its effects on the expected $V_B^-$ NMR signal. Lastly, we identify potential sample targets and operational regimes best suited for both nanoscale and micron-scale $V_B^-$ NMR.</p>

            <h2>A new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rhea Alexander</p>
            <p>Transversal encoded gatesets are highly desirable for fault tolerant quantum computing. However, a quantum error correcting code which exactly corrects for local erasure noise and supports a universal set of transversal gates is ruled out by the Eastin-Knill theorem. Here we provide a new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem for the single-shot regime when we allow for some probability of error in the decoding. In particular, we show that a quantum error correcting code can support a universal set of transversal gates and approximately correct for local erasure if and only if the conditional min-entropy of the Choi state of the encoding and noise channel is upper bounded by a simple function of the worst-case error probability. Our no-go theorem can be computed by solving a semidefinite program, and, in the spirit of the original Eastin-Knill theorem, is formulated in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient, ensuring achievability whenever it is passed. As an example, we find that with $n=100$ physical qutrits we can encode $k=1$ logical qubit in the $W$-state code, which admits a universal transversal set of gates and corrects for single subsystem erasure with error probability of $\varepsilon = 0.005$. To establish our no-go result, we leverage tools from the resource theory of asymmetry, where, in the single-shot regime, a single (output state-dependent) resource monotone governs all state purifications.</p>

We provide an analytical explanation for this singular behavior and establish a connection to the concept of ground state factorization observed in spin chains. Moreover, we analyze the open chain scenario and observe characteristic symmetry changes in the ground state corresponding to Majorana zero modes. These results demonstrate the power of complex network analysis in revealing hidden features in such systems.</p>

To minimize vibration noise from velocity-modulated sources, we implement a multistage vibration isolation system, achieving a vibration noise reduction exceeding 700-fold. We establish new constraints on vector-boson-mediated parity-violating interactions, improving experimental sensitivity by three orders of magnitude compared to previous limits.

Pairing our second-order adjoint method with a trust region optimizer (a type of Newton method), we show that it outperforms a first-order method, requiring significantly fewer iterations and wall time to find optimal controls for four molecular systems. Our derivation of the second-order adjoint method allows for arbitrary parameterizations of the controls.</p>

            <p>We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers have great potential to solve problems which are intractable on classical computers. However, quantum processors have not yet reached the required scale to run applications which outperform traditional computers. Leading hardware platforms, such as superconducting qubit based processors, will soon become bottlenecked by the physical constraints of their low temperature environments, and the expansion of quantum computers will necessitate quantum links between multiple processor modules. Optical frequencies offer the most promising path for these links due to their resilience to noise even at ambient temperature and the maturity of classical optical networks. However, required microwave-to-optics transducers cannot operate deterministically yet, which has widely been seen as a key challenge for their integration into fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we examine implementations of optical links between cryogenic units that surpass the performance of individual cryogenic modules even with the performance of existing or near-term microwave-to-optics transducers. We show methods for these transducers to provide on-demand entanglement between separated quantum processors with high fidelity and lay out key steps for adoption of the technology including scaling transducer numbers and integration with other hardware. Finally, we discuss a number of architectures comprised of these links which can drive the expansion of quantum data centers to utility scale.</p>

            <p>Lead-vacancy (PbV) centers in diamond with a large ground state splitting are expected to be a building block of quantum network nodes. Due to the heaviness of the Pb atom, it is challenging to fabricate high-quality PbV centers with a narrow inhomogeneous distribution and stable charge state. In this study, for the formation of the PbV centers, high temperature anneal up to 2300°C is performed after Pb ion implantation. At a lower temperature of 1800°C, the PbV centers show a large inhomogeneous distribution and spectral diffusion, while higher temperatures of 2200-2300°C leads to narrow inhomogeneous distributions with standard deviations of ~5 GHz. The charge state transition of the PbV centers formed at 2200°C occurs by capturing photo-carriers generated from surrounding defects under 532 nm laser irradiation. Finally, multiple stable PbV centers with nearly identical photon frequencies are obtained, which is essential for applications in quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Computing the exact dynamics of many-body quantum systems becomes intractable as system size grows. Here, we present a symmetry-based method that provides an exponential reduction in the complexity of a broad class of such problems $\unicode{x2014}$ qubits coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths. We identify conditions under which partial permutational symmetry emerges and exploit it to group qubits into collective multi-level degrees of freedom, which we term ''superspins.'' These superspins obey a generalized angular momentum algebra, reducing the relevant Hilbert space dimension from exponential to polynomial. Using this framework, we efficiently compute many-body superradiant dynamics in large arrays of qubits coupled to waveguides and ring resonators, showing that $\unicode{x2014}$ unlike in conventional Dicke superradiance $\unicode{x2014}$ the total spin length is not conserved. At long times, dark states become populated. We identify configurations where these states exhibit metrologically useful entanglement. Our approach enables exact treatment of complex dissipative dynamics beyond the fully symmetric limit and provides a rigorous benchmark for approximate numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) harness the inherent unpredictability of quantum mechanics to produce true randomness. Yet, in many optical implementations, the light source remains a potential vulnerability - susceptible to deviations from ideal behavior and even adversarial eavesdropping. Source-device-independent (SDI) protocols address this with a pragmatic strategy, by removing trust assumptions on the source, and instead rely on realistic modelling and characterization of the measurement device. In this work, we enhance an existing SDI-QRNG protocol by eliminating the need for a perfectly balanced beam splitter within the trusted measurement device, which is an idealized assumption made for the simplification of security analysis. We demonstrate that certified randomness can still be reliably extracted across a wide range of beam-splitting ratios, significantly improving the protocol's practicality and robustness. Using only off-the-shelf components, our implementation achieves real-time randomness generation rates of 0.347 Gbps. We also experimentally validate the protocol's resilience against adversarial attacks and highlight its self-testing capabilities. These advances mark a significant step toward practical, lightweight, high-performance, fully-passive, and composably secure QRNGs suitable for real-world deployment.</p>

            <p>The fidelity and quantum nondemolition character of the dispersive readout in circuit QED are limited by unwanted transitions to highly excited states at specific photon numbers in the readout resonator. This observation can be explained by multiphoton resonances between computational states and highly excited states in strongly driven nonlinear systems, analogous to multiphoton ionization in atoms and molecules. In this work, we utilize the multilevel nature of high-$E_J/E_C$ transmons to probe the excited-state dynamics induced by strong drives during readout. With up to 10 resolvable states, we quantify the critical photon number of ionization, the resulting state after ionization, and the fraction of the population transferred to highly excited states. Moreover, using pulse-shaping to control the photon number in the readout resonator in the high-power regime, we tune the adiabaticity of the transition and verify that transmon ionization is a Landau-Zener-type transition. Our experimental results agree well with the theoretical prediction from a semiclassical driven transmon model and may guide future exploration of strongly driven nonlinear oscillators.</p>

            <p>The study of multipartite entanglement is much less developed than the bipartite scenario. Recently, a string of results \cite{diPierro_2018, mengoni2019persistenthomologyanalysismultiqubit, bart2023, hamilton2023probing} have proposed using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to attach topological quantities to multipartite states. However, these quantities are not directly connected to concrete information processing tasks making their interpretations vague. We take the first steps in connecting these abstract topological quantities to operational interpretations of entanglement in two scenarios. The first is we provide a bound on the Integrated Euler Characteristic defined by Hamilton and Leditzky in \cite{hamilton2023probing} via an average distillable entanglement, which we develop as a generalization of the Meyer-Wallach entanglement measure studied by Scott in \cite{Scott_k-uniform}. This allows us to connect the distance of an error correcting code to the Integrated Euler Characteristic. The second is we provide a characterization of graph states via the birth and death times of the connected components and 1-dimensional cycles of the entanglement complex. In other words, the entanglement distance behavior of the first Betti number $\beta_1(\varepsilon)$ allows us to determine if a state is locally equivalent to a GHZ state, potentially providing new verification schemes for highly entangled states.</p>

            <p>A key challenge in achieving scalable fault tolerance in superconducting quantum processors is readout fidelity, which lags behind one- and two-qubit gate fidelity. A major limitation in improving qubit readout is measurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused by multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers. Since ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that in transmons -- the most widely used superconducting qubit -- the photon number at which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate charge dependent. This dependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit frequency is gate charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction by characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator photon population while actively stabilizing the transmon's gate charge. Furthermore, because highly excited states are involved, achieving quantitative agreement between theory and experiment requires accounting for higher-order harmonics in the transmon Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oskar Słowik, Piotr Dulian, Adam Sawicki</p>
            <p>We introduce a measure for evaluating the efficiency of finite universal quantum gate sets $\mathcal{S}$, called the Quantum Circuit Overhead (QCO), and the related notion of $T$-Quantum Circuit Overhead ($T$-QCO). The overhead is based on the comparison between the efficiency of $\mathcal{S}$ versus the optimal efficiency among all gate sets with the same number of gates. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ($T$-)QCO by extensive numerical calculations of its upper bounds, providing insight into the efficiency of various choices of single-qubit $\mathcal{S}$, including Haar-random gate sets and the gate sets derived from finite subgroups, such as Clifford and Hurwitz groups. In particular, our results suggest that, in terms of the upper bounds on the $T$-QCO, the famous T gate is a highly non-optimal choice for the completion of the Clifford gate set, even among the gates of order 8. We identify the optimal choices of such completions for both finite subgroups.</p>

            <h2>Quantum information engines: Bounds on performance metrics by measurement time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Kirchberg, Abraham Nitzan</p>
            <p>Information engines, sometimes referred to as Maxwell Demon engines, utilize information obtained through measurement to control the conversion of energy into useful work. Discussions around such devices often assume the measurement step to be instantaneous, assessing its cost by Landauer's information erasure within the measurement device. While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von-Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement. We also discuss ways to extend our considerations using these concepts, such as in measurement-enhanced photochemical reactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Koizumi, Kaito Wada, Wataru Mizukami, Nobuyuki Yoshioka</p>
            <p>Achieving quantum advantage in efficiently estimating collective properties of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental goal in quantum computing. While the quantum gradient estimation (QGE) algorithm has been shown to achieve doubly quantum enhancement in the precision and the number of observables, it remains unclear whether one benefits in practical applications. In this work, we present a generalized framework of adaptive QGE algorithm, and further propose two variants which enable us to estimate the collective properties of fermionic systems using the smallest cost among existing quantum algorithms. The first method utilizes the symmetry inherent in the target state, and the second method enables estimation in a single-shot manner using the parallel scheme. We show that our proposal offers a quadratic speedup compared with prior QGE algorithms in the task of fermionic partial tomography for systems with limited particle numbers. Furthermore, we provide the numerical demonstration that, for a problem of estimating fermionic 2-RDMs, our proposals improve the number of queries to the target state preparation oracle by a factor of 100 for the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor and by a factor of 500 for Fermi-Hubbard model of 100 sites.</p>

Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, another variant of the Heisenberg-limited scaling algorithm, and show how the estimation error is minimized under the circuit structure that resembles the phase estimation algorithm. We finally describe the details for the numerical evaluation of the query complexity of the Heisenberg-limited algorithms and sampling-based methods to make a thorough comparison in the task of estimating fermionic $k$-RDMs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory D. Kahanamoku-Meyer, John Blue, Thiago Bergamaschi, Craig Gidney, Isaac L. Chuang</p>
            <p>When designing quantum circuits for a given unitary, it can be much cheaper to achieve a good approximation on most inputs than on all inputs. In this work we formalize this idea, and propose that such "optimistic quantum circuits" are often sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare algorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs, we provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones. Applying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth $O(\log (n / \epsilon))$ for tunable error parameter $\epsilon$, uses $n$ total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is logarithmically local for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free. The circuit's error is bounded by $\epsilon$ on all input states except an $O(\epsilon)$-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather simple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast arithmetic constructions [arXiv:2403.18006], the optimistic QFT yields factoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only $2n + O(n/\log n)$ total qubits. Applying our reduction technique, we also construct the first approximate QFT to achieve the asymptotically optimal depth of $O(\log (n/\epsilon))$ with a sublinear number of ancilla qubits, well-controlled error on all inputs, and no intermediate measurements.</p>

            <p>Ideal spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) is proven to be a quantum-optimal tool for exoplanet detection, i.e., asymmetric source discrimination. However, recent investigations into the related problems of separation estimation and symmetric source discrimination showed its efficiency to be limited in the presence of noise. In this work, we use analytical tools to scrutinize the practical applicability of SPADE and derive the associated optimal decision strategy for exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections. On the one hand, we find that the probability of detection of noisy SPADE has the same scaling with planet-star separation and relative brightness as conventional techniques, such as direct imaging and coronagraphs. On the other hand, we prove that, due to a superior scaling coefficient under realistic noise conditions, SPADE remains the most efficient method for practical exoplanet detection in the sub-Rayleigh regime.</p>

            <p>Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) is rapidly gaining interest across a wide range of disciplines. As QISE continues to evolve, engineering will play an increasingly critical role in advancing quantum technologies. While efforts to characterize introductory QISE courses are underway, a comprehensive understanding of QISE education across the United States remains lacking. Developing a broad understanding of the QISE education landscape is crucial for addressing the needs of the growing quantum industry and ensuring equitable access for a diverse range of participants. This paper presents part of an ongoing effort to characterize the current landscape of QISE courses and degree programs in higher education in the US. To achieve this, we used publicly available information from university and college websites to capture information on over 8000 courses that address quantum in some way and nearly 90 QISE specific programs (e.g., degrees, minors, certificates). The majority of these programs are interdisciplinary and include engineering; 14 of them are housed exclusively in engineering departments. We find most programs are offered at research intensive institutions. Our results showcase an opportunity for program developers at non-research intensive institutions to justify the creation of QISE programs, which would also address calls from different stakeholders in QISE education for a more diverse QISE workforce. We suggest strategies based on the findings of this study such as integrating QISE into existing engineering courses, investing in the development of QISE courses and programs at non-PhD-granting institutions, and making courses with QISE content accessible to students from a variety of majors.</p>

            <p>The gravitational constant (G) is the least precisely known fundamental constant of nature, with persistent and significant discrepancies between measurement methods. New techniques for measuring G with systematic effects different from commonly applied pendulum methods are required. Neutrons are convenient probes of gravitational forces as they are both massive and electrically neutral, properties that allowed a single-crystal neutron interferometer (NI) to achieve the first experimental demonstration of gravitationally induced quantum interference. Despite this, the limitation of single-crystal NIs to monoenergetic beams significantly reduces neutron flux, making precision gravitational measurements unfeasible. A new NI design called the phase-grating moiré interferometer (PGMI) has been shown to increase neutron flux by orders of magnitude while allowing grating separation that maintains similar interferometer area to previous NI devices. Here, we propose and describe an experiment to measure G using the PGMI to a precision comparable to measurements from the CODATA 2022 evaluation. A Monte Carlo model for incorporating nonlinear potentials into a PGMI is introduced. This model is used to evaluate sources of systematic uncertainty and quantify the uncertainty in G arising from these effects. The effect of lunar gravitation on a torsion pendulum experiment from CODATA 2022 is calculated, and the need for possible correction factors is demonstrated. This work demonstrates that a neutron PGMI can be used to measure G to $150$ parts-per-million in the near term with the potential to achieve greater precision in future experimental designs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Chuwen Ma, Yue Yu</p>
            <p>The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. We show that by employing a smooth initialization of the warped phase transform \cite{JLM24SchrBackward}, Schrödingerization can in fact achieve optimal scaling in matrix queries. This paper presents the detailed implementation of three smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the cut-off function, (b) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (c) the Fourier transform methods, that achieve optimality for (a) and near-optimality for (b) and (c). A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</p>

            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool for studying strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. A core component of the algorithm is the approximate contraction of the iPEPS, where the computational bottleneck typically lies in the singular value or eigenvalue decompositions involved in the renormalization step. This is particularly true on GPUs, where tensor contractions are substantially faster than these decompositions. Here we propose a contraction scheme for $C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are substantially faster -- especially on GPUs. Our approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard CTMRG and yields state-of-the-art results for the Heisenberg and $J_1$-$J_2$ models in about one hour on an H100 GPU.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Narayan Kundu, Meenakshi Rana, Aryya Ghosh, Dhananjay Nandi</p>
            <p>We present a kinematically complete study of dissociative electron attachment (DEA) in linear OCS molecules, focusing on how electrons resonantly attach and trigger dissociation. Near the Franck-Condon regime, DEA is dominated by molecular shape resonances, where transient OCS$^-$ states form with high vibrational amplitudes, spectroscopically evident as broad features in DEA cross-sections. As the electron beam energy increases from 5.5 to 6.0 eV, S$^-$ population shifts from lower to higher-energy highly dense bending vibrational states, reinforcing our findings on dipole-forbidden vibronic intensity borrowing. Our advanced potential energy curve calculations, employing the Equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles for electron attachment (EA-EOMCCSD) method, reveal that beyond the shape resonance, non-adiabatic resonant tunneling governs the avoided crossings, dynamically generating three mode-specific vibronic Feshbach resonances before complete dissociation into three distinct kinetic energy bands of S$^-$. Our theoretical results probe most of the experimental observations quantitatively and qualitatively. These insights deepen our fundamental understanding of resonance-mediated dissociation in electron-molecule resonant scattering, with broader implications for quantum mechanics, plasma physics, vibrational revival, astrochemistry, and radiation damage research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Chuan Lu, Fu Xu, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum lattice spin models. The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of $\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.</p>

            <h2>Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas LaRacuente</p>
            <p>States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</p>

            <p>Quantum information processing faces a significant hurdle: noise. Different noise sources induce varying errors in quantum operations depending on the underlying dynamics. To gain a deeper understanding of these error mechanisms, we introduce the concept of Quantum Error Evolution Diagrams (QEED). These QEEDs establish a dual correspondence between driven noisy quantum dynamics and geometric space curves, offering quantitative geometric metrics to assess the severity of these errors. This theory provides a framework for designing universal robust quantum gates to correct the errors induced by generic noises. Furthermore, we present a protocol for constructing a universal set of single- and two-qubit robust quantum gates. These gates, designed with simple and smooth control pulses of arbitrary length, achieve fidelities exceeding 99.99\% across a wide range of noise strengths. This geometric approach offers significant advantages over existing methods. Overall, our work provides new insights into the geometric nature of noisy quantum dynamics and paves the way for the development of approaches to dynamically correct quantum errors.</p>

            <p>We propose a method for constructing $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits for quantum phase estimation of a molecular Hamiltonian in quantum chemistry by using variational optimization of quantum circuits solely on classical computers. The $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuit generates a quantum state which encodes the coefficients of the terms in the Hamiltonian as probability amplitudes and plays a crucial role in the state-of-the-art efficient implementations of quantum phase estimation. We employ the automatic quantum circuit encoding algorithm [Shirakawa $\textit{et al.}$, arXiv:2112.14524] to construct $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits, which requires classical simulations of quantum circuits of $O(\log N)$ qubits with $N$ being the number of qubits of the Hamiltonian. The generated $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits do not need any ancillary qubit. We demonstrate our method by investigating the number of $T$-gates of the obtained $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians of various molecules, which shows a constant-factor reduction compared to previous approaches that do not use ancillary qubits. Since the number of available logical qubits and $T$ gates will be limited at the early stage of the fault-tolerant quantum computing, the proposed method is particularly of use for performing the quantum phase estimation with such limited capability.</p>

            <p>We provide two improvements to Regev's recent quantum factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025), addressing its space efficiency and its noise-tolerance. Our first contribution is to improve the quantum space efficiency of Regev's algorithm while keeping the circuit size the same. Our main result constructs a quantum factoring circuit using $O(n \log n)$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates. We achieve the best of Shor and Regev (upto a logarithmic factor in the space complexity): on the one hand, Regev's circuit requires $O(n^{3/2})$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates, while Shor's circuit requires $O(n^2 \log n)$ gates but only $O(n \log n)$ qubits. As with Regev, to factor an $n$-bit integer $N$, we run our circuit independently $O(\sqrt{n})$ times and apply Regev's classical postprocessing procedure. Our optimization is achieved by implementing efficient and reversible exponentiation with Fibonacci numbers in the exponent, rather than the usual powers of 2, adapting work by Kaliski (arXiv:1711.02491) from the classical reversible setting to the quantum setting. This technique also allows us to perform quantum modular exponentiation that is efficient in both space and size without requiring significant precomputation, a result that may be useful for other quantum algorithms. A key ingredient of our exponentiation implementation is an efficient circuit for a function resembling in-place quantum-quantum modular multiplication. Our second contribution is to show that Regev's classical postprocessing procedure can be modified to tolerate a constant fraction of the quantum circuit runs being corrupted by errors. In contrast, Regev's analysis of his classical postprocessing procedure requires all $\approx \sqrt{n}$ runs to be successful. In a nutshell, we achieve this using lattice reduction techniques to detect and filter out corrupt samples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tristan Le Roy-Deloison, Edwin Peter Lobo, Jef Pauwels, Stefano Pironio</p>
            <p>Photon losses are the main obstacle to fully photonic implementations of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD). Motivated by recent work showing that routed Bell scenarios offer increased robustness to detection inefficiencies for the certification of long-range quantum correlations, we investigate DIQKD protocols based on a routed setup. In these protocols, in some of the test rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using noncommutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fawzi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. For high-quality short-path tests, we find that routed DIQKD protocols are significantly more robust to losses, showing an improvement of approximately $30\%$ in the detection efficiency compared to their nonrouted counterparts. This translates to a large improvement in the distance over which nonzero key can be distilled in optical setups with near-perfect single-photon detectors, where the main source of loss in the setup is due to transmission in the fiber. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as $50\%$ for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any QKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements. However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haijin Ding, Nina H. Amini, John E. Gough, Guofeng Zhang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study both open-loop control and closed-loop measurement feedback control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics resulting from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment. We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.</p>

Our results show that decoherence due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment leads to partial revivals of decoherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows.</p>

            <h2>Effects of phase-gradient on the nonadiabatic dynamics and photon-phonon conversion in one-dimensional array of optomechanical cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Divya Mishra, Parvendra Kumar</p>
            <p>Manipulation of photonic and phononic coupling in the coupled cavities plays a crucial role in the development of nonreciprocal devices and photon-phonon conversion. Here, we theoretically investigate how the phase gradient of a driving laser affects the coupling between photonic and phononic modes. This, in turn, affects and offers the controllability of the nonadiabatic dynamics of the population of hybrid eigenmodes following a sudden change in the optomechanical coupling. We show that the controllable nonadiabatic dynamics can be attributed to the phase-induced alteration of the bandgaps in the hybrid eigenmodes. We further demonstrate that the phase-assisted control of the relative weight of photonic and phononic modes in the hybrid eigenmodes also contributes to the nonadiabatic dynamics. Finally, we investigate the effects of phase on the coherent conversion of photon-phonon in a finite-size array.</p>

            <p>We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for preparing the Gibbs state of the two-dimensional toric code Hamiltonian at any temperature, starting from any initial condition, significantly improving upon prior estimates that suggested exponential scaling with inverse temperature. Our approach combines the Lindblad dynamics using a local Davies generator with simple global jump operators to enable efficient transitions between logical sectors. Our proof also shows that the Lindblad dynamics with a digitally implemented low-temperature local Davies generator is able to efficiently drive the quantum state towards the ground state manifold.</p>

            <h2>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Qin, Casey Jameson, Alireza Goldar, Michael B. Wakin, Zhexuan Gong, Zhihui Zhu</p>
            <p>While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question. In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.</p>

            <h2>Efficient self-consistent learning of gate set Pauli noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Senrui Chen, Zhihan Zhang, Liang Jiang, Steven T. Flammia</p>
            <p>Understanding quantum noise is an essential step towards building practical quantum information processing systems. Pauli noise is a useful model that has been widely applied in quantum benchmarking, error mitigation, and error correction. Despite intensive study, most existing works focus on learning Pauli noise channels associated with some specific gates rather than treating the gate set as a whole. A learning algorithm that is self-consistent, complete, and efficient at the same time is yet to be established. In this work, we study the task of gate set Pauli noise learning, where a set of quantum gates, state preparation, and measurements all suffer from unknown Pauli noise channels with a customized noise ansatz. Using tools from algebraic graph theory, we analytically characterize the self-consistently learnable degrees of freedom for Pauli noise models with arbitrary linear ansatz, and design experiments to efficiently learn all the learnable information. Specifically, we show that all learnable information about the gate noise can be learned to relative precision, under mild assumptions on the noise ansatz. We then demonstrate the flexibility of our theory by applying it to concrete physically motivated ansatzs (such as spatially local or quasi-local noise) and experimentally relevant gate sets (such as parallel CZ gates). These results not only enhance the theoretical understanding of quantum noise learning, but also provide a feasible recipe for characterizing existing and near-future quantum information processing devices.</p>

            <h2>Adversarial Data Poisoning Attacks on Quantum Machine Learning in the NISQ Era</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satwik Kundu, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
            <p>With the growing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the increasing availability of quantum computers through cloud providers, addressing the potential security risks associated with QML has become an urgent priority. One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data poisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to training data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML models. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and training to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them ineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure intra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding circuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a \underline{Qu}antum \underline{I}ndiscriminate \underline{D}ata Poisoning attack, QUID. Through extensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g., IBM\_Brisbane's noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID achieves up to $92\%$ accuracy degradation in model performance compared to baseline models and up to $75\%$ accuracy degradation compared to random label-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical defenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding $50\%$, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work represents the first attempt to reevaluate data poisoning attacks in the context of QML.</p>

            <p>In two prior papers of this series, it was proposed that a wavefunction model of a heavy particle and a collection of light particles might generate ``Brownian-Motion-Like" trajectories as well as diffusive motion (displacement proportional to the square-root of time) of the heavy particle, but did not exhibit a concrete instance. Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model which, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML trajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant and the molecular mass of light particles make an appearance in the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory from the work of Poincar{é} and Einstein in the previous century.</p>

            <h2>Aspects of Complexity in Quantum Evolutions on the Bloch Sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Cafaro, Emma Clements, Abeer Alanazi</p>
            <p>We enhance our quantitative comprehension of the complexity associated with both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions that connect arbitrary source and target states on the Bloch sphere, as recently presented in Nucl. Phys. B1010, 116755 (2025). Initially, we examine each unitary Schrodinger quantum evolution selected through various metrics, such as path length, geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of the corresponding quantum-mechanical trajectory that connects the source state to the target state on the Bloch sphere. Subsequently, we evaluate the selected evolutions using our proposed measure of complexity, as well as in relation to the concept of complexity length scale. The choice of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal evolutions, along with the selection of source and target states, enables us to conduct pertinent sanity checks that seek to validate the physical relevance of the framework supporting our proposed complexity measure. Our research suggests that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions possess a lower complexity than their inefficient counterparts. However, it is important to recognize that complexity is not solely determined by length; in fact, longer trajectories that are adequately curved may exhibit a complexity that is less than or equal to that of shorter trajectories with a lower curvature coefficient.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jasper Johannes Postema, Servaas J.J.M.F. Kokkelmans</p>
            <p>Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code offers protection against decoherence and enhances the fidelity of qubits and gate operations. One of the fundamental challenges of QEC is to construct codes with asymptotically good parameters, i.e. a non-vanishing rate and relative minimum distance. Such codes provide compact quantum memory with low overhead and enhanced error correcting capabilities, compared to state-of-the-art topological error correction codes such as the surface or colour codes. Recently, bivariate bicycle (BB) codes have emerged as a promising candidate for such compact memory, though the exact tradeoff of the code parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ remained unknown. In this Article, we explore these codes by leveraging their ring structure, and predict their dimension as well as conditions on their existence. Finally, we highlight asymptotic badness. Though this excludes this subclass of codes from the search towards practical good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, it does not affect the utility of the moderately long codes that are known, which can already be used to experimentally demonstrate better QEC beyond the surface code.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition occurs between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Finally, we discuss the coexistence of SPT and SWSSB in the double SPT state from the view point of symmetrically invertible property, and comment on the classification of ASPT proposed recently. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</p>

            <p>The area of quantum circuit simulation has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, due to the exponentially increasing computational costs, assessing and validating these models on large datasets poses significant obstacles. Despite plenty of research in quantum simulation, issues such as memory management, system adaptability, and execution efficiency remain unresolved. In this study, we introduce QEA, a state vector-based hardware accelerator that overcomes these difficulties with four key improvements: optimized memory allocation management, open PE, flexible ALU, and simplified CX swapper. To evaluate QEA's capabilities, we implemented and evaluated it on the AMD Alveo U280 board, which uses only 0.534 W of power. Experimental results show that QEA is extremely flexible, supporting a wide range of quantum circuits, has excellent fidelity, making it appropriate for standard quantum emulators, and outperforms powerful CPUs and related works up to 153.16x better in terms of normalized gate speed. This study has considerable potential as a useful approach for quantum emulators in future works.</p>

The quantum spectral sampling algorithm generalizes to estimating any quantity $\sum_j f(\lambda_j)$, where $\lambda_j$ are the matrix eigenvalues. For example, the algorithm allows the efficient estimation of the partition function $Z(\beta) =\sum_j e^{-\beta E_j}$ of a Hamiltonian system with energy eigenvalues $E_j$, and of the entropy $ S =-\sum_j p_j \log p_j$ of a density matrix with eigenvalues $p_j$.</p>

            <p>We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.</p>

            <p>Surface codes represent a leading approach for quantum error correction (QEC), offering a path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). However, efficiently implementing algorithms, particularly using Pauli-based computation (PBC) with lattice surgery, necessitates careful resource optimization. Prior work often employs static layouts and simplified error models. These typically fail to capture the full costs and dynamic nature of active computation, leading to resource bottlenecks and suboptimal architectural designs. To address this, we introduce SPARO. SPARO features a comprehensive logical error model based on a large corpus of numerical simulations encompassing active Pauli-based computation (PBC) operations-including Pauli product measurements (PPMs), idling qubits, and patch rotations. Our numerical models are integrated within an end-to-end compilation pipeline. SPARO analyzes algorithm-specific bottlenecks arising from constraints such as limited routing areas or magic-state factory throughput. SPARO then dynamically allocates available hardware resources, balancing compute, routing, and magic-state distillation, to minimize space-time overhead and logical error rates for specific workloads. Our simulations demonstrate that SPARO effectively identifies critical resource trade-offs. When evaluated on benchmark circuits, SPARO identifies resource configurations achieving up to 51.11% logical error rate reductions for 433-qubit ADDER circuits when compared to state-of-the-art static layouts using an identical total resource budget. This dynamic approach enables effective co-optimization of PBC execution and surface-code architectures, significantly improving overall resource efficiency. SPARO will be open sourced.</p>

            <p>We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial state of a quantum many-body system subject to global projective measurements at stroboscopic times. We show that this distribution can be mapped to a continuation of the canonical partition function of a classical spin chain with noninteracting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterized by the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to conclude that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially at long times, depending on whether the spin chain displays a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing a rich phase behavior, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time as a function of $N$. The analysis presented here provides an overarching understanding of many-body quantum first-detection problems in terms of equilibrium thermodynamic phases. Our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with exact numerical computations.</p>

We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.</p>

The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits.

            <p>Dipolar supersolids--quantum states that are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while its solid nature remains uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work, we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound: a supersonic shear wave. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</p>

We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization.

We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} < \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</p>

            <h2>Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan He, Chih-Chun Chien</p>
            <p>We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsuneya Yoshida, Emil J. Bergholtz, Tomáš Bzdušek</p>
            <p>Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</p>

            <p>The detection of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a state-characterization task that can be viewed as a benchmark in that it confirms appropriate levels of coherence and the ability to control the system in the laboratory. However, many GME tests require joint measurements on all or the majority of the involved quantum systems, posing experimental challenges for platforms with restricted qubit connectivity such as typical setups for time-bin encoded qubits. Here we construct a family of versatile GME criteria that only require measurements of a small subset, i.e., $O(n^2)$ out of $2^n$, of (at most) $m$-body stabilizers of $n$-qubit target graph states, with $m$ bounded from above by twice the maximum degree of the underlying graph. We present analytical results for white-noise-added graph states and numerical simulations for graph states produced in microwave photonic qubits that demonstrate the versatility and performance of our GME criteria under realistic conditions.</p>

            <h2>Is Entanglement Necessary for the Typicality Argument in Statistical Mechanics?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro S. Correia, Gabriel Dias Carvalho, Thiago R. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>Typicality arguments replace the postulated mixed state ensembles of statistical mechanics with pure states sampled uniformly at random, explaining why most microstates of large systems exhibit thermal behavior. This paradigm has been revived in quantum contexts, where entanglement is deemed essential, but no clear quantitative link between entanglement structure and typicality has been established. Here, we study pure quantum states with controlled multipartite entanglement and show that when entanglement grows with system size $N$, fluctuations in macroscopic observables decay exponentially with $N$, whereas if entanglement remains finite, one recovers only the classical $1/\sqrt{N}$ suppression. Our work thus provides a quantitative connection between entanglement structure and the emergence of typicality, demonstrating that entanglement is crucial for thermalization in small quantum systems but unnecessary to justify equilibrium in macroscopic ensembles. This unifies classical and quantum foundations of statistical mechanics by pinpointing exactly when and why entanglement matters.</p>

            <h2>Optimized Quantum Embedding: A Universal Minor-Embedding Framework for Large Complete Bipartite Graph</h2>

            <p>Minor embedding is essential for mapping largescale combinatorial problems onto quantum annealers, particularly in quantum machine learning and optimization. This work presents an optimized, universal minor-embedding framework that efficiently accommodates complete bipartite graphs onto the hardware topology of quantum annealers. By leveraging the inherent topographical periodicity of the physical quantum adiabatic annealer processor, our method systematically reduces qubit chain lengths, resulting in enhanced stability, computational efficiency, and scalability of quantum annealing. We benchmark our embedding framework against Minorminer, the default heuristic embedding algorithm, for the Pegasus topology, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves embedding quality. Our empirical results show a 99.98% reduction in embedding time for a 120 x 120 complete bipartite graphs. Additionally, our method eliminates long qubit chains, which primarily cause decoherence and computational errors in quantum annealing. These findings advance the scalability of quantum embeddings, particularly for quantum generative models, anomaly detection, and large-scale optimization tasks. Our results establish a foundation for integrating efficient quantum-classical hybrid solutions, paving the way for practical applications in quantum-enhanced machine learning and optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanjing Xu, Xiaoyuan Liu, Alex Pothen, Ilya Safro</p>
            <p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the promising variational approaches of quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In QAOA, variational parameters need to be optimized by solving a series of nonlinear, nonconvex optimization programs. In this work, we propose a QAOA parameter transfer scheme using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to solve Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems. We prepare optimized parameters for graphs of 12 and 14 vertices and use GATs to transfer their parameters to larger graphs. Additionally, we design a hybrid distributed resource-aware algorithm for MIS (HyDRA-MIS), which decomposes large problems into smaller ones that can fit onto noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We integrate our GAT-based parameter transfer approach to HyDRA-MIS and demonstrate competitive results compared to KaMIS, a state-of-the-art classical MIS solver, on graphs with several thousands vertices.</p>

            <p>The rapid progress in quantum hardware is expected to make them viable tools for the study of quantum algorithms in the near term. The timeline to useful algorithmic experimentation can be accelerated by techniques that use many noisy shots to produce an accurate estimate of the observable of interest. One such technique is to encode the quantum circuit using an error detection code and discard the samples for which an error has been detected. An underexplored property of error-detecting codes is the flexibility in the circuit encoding and fault-tolerant gadgets, which enables their co-optimization with the algorthmic circuit. However, standard circuit optimization tools cannot be used to exploit this flexibility as optimization must preserve the fault-tolerance of the gadget. In this work, we focus on the $[[k+2, k, 2]]$ Iceberg quantum error detection code, which is tailored to trapped-ion quantum processors. We design new flexible fault-tolerant gadgets for the Iceberg code, which we then co-optimize with the algorithmic circuit for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) using tree search. By co-optimizing the QAOA circuit and the Iceberg gadgets, we achieve an improvement in QAOA success probability from $44\%$ to $65\%$ and an increase in post-selection rate from $4\%$ to $33\%$ at 22 algorithmic qubits, utilizing 330 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 744 physical two-qubit gates on the Quantinuum H2-1 quantum computer, compared to the previous state-of-the-art hardware demonstration. Furthermore, we demonstrate better-than-unencoded performance for up to 34 algorithmic qubits, employing 510 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 1140 physical two-qubit gates.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption for Quantum Computer Programs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Goertzel</p>
            <p>We present a lattice-based scheme for homomorphic evaluation of quantum programs and proofs that remains secure against quantum adversaries. Classical homomorphic encryption is lifted to the quantum setting by replacing composite-order groups with Module Learning-With-Errors (MLWE) lattices and by generalizing polynomial functors to bounded natural super functors (BNSFs). A secret depolarizing BNSF mask hides amplitudes, while each quantum state is stored as an MLWE ciphertext pair. We formalize security with the qIND-CPA game that allows coherent access to the encryption oracle and give a four-hybrid reduction to decisional MLWE. The design also covers practical issues usually left open. A typed QC-bridge keeps classical bits produced by measurements encrypted yet still usable as controls, with weak-measurement semantics for expectation-value workloads. Encrypted Pauli twirls add circuit privacy. If a fixed knowledge base is needed, its axioms are shipped as MLWE "capsules"; the evaluator can use them but cannot read them. A rho-calculus driver schedules encrypted tasks across several QPUs and records an auditable trace on an RChain-style ledger. Performance analysis shows that the extra lattice arithmetic fits inside today's QPU idle windows: a 100-qubit, depth-10^3 teleportation-based proof runs in about 10 ms, the public key (seed only) is 32 bytes, and even a CCA-level key stays below 300 kB. A photonic Dirac-3 prototype that executes homomorphic teleportation plus knowledge-base-relative amplitude checks appears feasible with current hardware. These results indicate that fully homomorphic, knowledge-base-aware quantum reasoning is compatible with near-term quantum clouds and standard post-quantum security assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Capturing Quantum Snapshots from a Single Copy via Mid-Circuit Measurement and Dynamic Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debarshi Kundu, Avimita Chatterjee, Archisman Ghosh, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
            <p>We propose Quantum Snapshot with Dynamic Circuit (QSDC), a hardware-agnostic, learning-driven framework for capturing quantum snapshots: non-destructive estimates of quantum states at arbitrary points within a quantum circuit, which can then be classically stored and later reconstructed. This functionality is vital for introspection, debugging, and memory in quantum systems, yet remains fundamentally constrained by the no-cloning theorem and the destructive nature of measurement. QSDC introduces a guess-and-check methodology in which a classical model, powered by either gradient-based neural networks or gradient-free evolutionary strategie, is trained to reconstruct an unknown quantum state using fidelity from the SWAP test as the sole feedback signal. Our approach supports single-copy, mid-circuit state reconstruction, assuming hardware with dynamic circuit support and sufficient coherence time. We validate core components of QSDC both in simulation and on IBM quantum hardware. In noiseless settings, our models achieve average fidelity up to 0.999 across 100 random quantum states; on real devices, we accurately reconstruct known single-qubit states (e.g., Hadamard) within three optimization steps.</p>

            <p>Based on the physical process of two-atom simultaneous excitation by single photon, we proposed a frequency dividing scheme in superconducting quantum circuit. The frequency division for a microwave photon consists of two quantum processes: firstly, two qubits share the energy of single photon in high-frequency resonator through the three-body interaction (two qubits and one photon); secondly, part energies of excited state qubits are transferred to corresponding low frequency resonators through two-body interactions (one qubit and one photon). By changing the parameters of pumping pulses, controllable output pulses can be realized through the superconducting frequency divider. The microwave and pulse signals created by the superconducting frequency divider can be used to pump or readout the superconducting qubits, which can greatly reduce the occupation amount of high-frequency cables in dilution refrigerator during the measurement of large scale superconducting quantum chip.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Variational Framework for Quantum Excited States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Xin Zhang, Lei Wang</p>
            <p>Determining quantum excited states is crucial across physics and chemistry but presents significant challenges for variational methods, primarily due to the need to enforce orthogonality to lower-energy states, often requiring state-specific optimization, penalty terms, or specialized ansatz constructions. We introduce a novel variational principle that overcomes these limitations, enabling the \textit{simultaneous} determination of multiple low-energy excited states. The principle is based on minimizing the trace of the inverse overlap matrix multiplied by the Hamiltonian matrix, $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{H})$, constructed from a set of \textit{non-orthogonal} variational states $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$. Here, $\mathbf{H}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | H | \psi_j\rangle$ and $\mathbf{S}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | \psi_j\rangle$ are the elements of the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, respectively. This approach variationally optimizes the entire low-energy subspace spanned by $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$ without explicit orthogonality constraints or penalty functions. We demonstrate the power and generality of this method across diverse physical systems and variational ansatzes: calculating the low-energy spectrum of 1D Heisenberg spin chains using matrix product states, finding vibrational spectrum of Morse potential using quantics tensor trains for real-space wavefunctions, and determining excited states for 2D fermionic Hubbard model with variational quantum circuits. In all applications, the method accurately and simultaneously obtains multiple lowest-lying energy levels and their corresponding states, showcasing its potential as a unified and flexible framework for calculating excited states on both classical and quantum computational platforms.</p>

            <p>We develop randomized quantum algorithms to simulate quantum collision models, also known as repeated interaction schemes, which provide a rich framework to model various open-system dynamics. The underlying technique involves composing time evolutions of the total (system, bath, and interaction) Hamiltonian and intermittent tracing out of the environment degrees of freedom. This results in a unified framework where any near-term Hamiltonian simulation algorithm can be incorporated to implement an arbitrary number of such collisions on early fault-tolerant quantum computers: we do not assume access to specialized oracles such as block encodings and minimize the number of ancilla qubits needed. In particular, using the correspondence between Lindbladian evolution and completely positive trace-preserving maps arising out of memoryless collisions, we provide an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating Lindbladian dynamics. For a system of $n$-qubits, we exhaustively compare the circuit depth needed to estimate the expectation value of an observable with respect to the reduced state of the system after time $t$ while employing different near-term Hamiltonian simulation techniques, requiring at most $n+2$ qubits in all. We compare the CNOT gate counts of the various approaches for estimating the Transverse Field Magnetization of a $10$-qubit XX-Heisenberg spin chain under amplitude damping. Finally, we also develop a framework to efficiently simulate an arbitrary number of memory-retaining collisions, i.e., where environments interact, leading to non-Markovian dynamics. Overall, our methods can leverage quantum collision models for both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics on early fault-tolerant quantum computers, shedding light on the advantages and limitations of simulating open systems dynamics using this framework.</p>

            <p>Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena. In quantum adaptive optics, biphoton aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, we introduce position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the focal plane of a microlens array. We experimentally demonstrate this method by performing phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film. Our method involves only one measurement step, so it is a more direct approach to biphoton phase measurement with a greatly improved efficiency, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy and communication.</p>

            <p>Detecting individual spins--including stable and metastable states--represents a fundamental challenge in quantum sensing with broad applications across condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and single-molecule magnetic resonance imaging. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as powerful nanoscale sensors, their performance for single-spin detection remains constrained by substantial environmental noise and restricted sensing volume. Here, we propose and demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through the strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold enhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold reduction in spatial resolution relative to single NV centers under ambient conditions. The protocol employs carefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through quantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we extend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly observing stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying state-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables simultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex quantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced sensing as a viable pathway toward atomic-scale characterization of quantum materials and interface.</p>

            <p>Conventionally in quantum sensing, the goal is to estimate one or more unknown parameters that are assumed to be deterministic - that is, they do not change between shots of the quantum-sensing protocol. We instead consider the setting where the parameters are stochastic: each shot of the quantum-sensing protocol senses parameter values that come from independent random draws. In this work, we explore three examples where the stochastic parameters are correlated and show how using entanglement provides a benefit in classification or estimation tasks: (1) a two-parameter classification task, for which there is an advantage in the low-shot regime; (2) an $N$-parameter estimation task and a classification variant of it, for which an entangled sensor requires just a constant number (independent of $N$) shots to achieve the same accuracy as an unentangled sensor using exponentially many (${\sim}2^N$) shots; (3) classifying the magnetization of a spin chain in thermal equilibrium, where the individual spins fluctuate but the total spin in one direction is conserved - this gives a practical setting in which stochastic parameters are correlated in a way that an entangled sensor can be designed to exploit. We also present a theoretical framework for assessing, for a given choice of entangled sensing protocol and distributions to discriminate between, how much advantage the entangled sensor would have over an unentangled sensor. Our work motivates the further study of sensing correlated stochastic parameters using entangled quantum sensors - and since classical sensors by definition cannot be entangled, our work shows the possibility for entangled quantum sensors to achieve an exponential advantage over classical sensors, in contrast to the typical quadratic advantage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>The Mpemba effect -- where hot systems cool faster than colder ones -- has intrigued both classical and quantum thermodynamics. As compared to classical systems, quantum systems add complexity due to quantum correlations. Recent works have explored anomalous relaxation and Mpemba-like effects in several quantum systems, considering isolated systems at zero temperature or open systems in contact with reservoirs under Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics. However, these models typically assume an initial unentangled system-bath state, overlooking the role of initial system-environment correlations. Here we propose a type of quantum Mpemba effect, distinct from the strong Mpemba effect, originating from initial system-bath entanglement solely. It is shown that the degree of initial entanglement significantly influences the early relaxation dynamics, with certain conditions causing backflow and retarded thermalization. As an example, we investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level atom in a photonic waveguide at zero temperature, where an initial atom-photon entangled state results in delayed relaxation and pronounced Mpemba effect. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum correlations in thermalization processes and open new avenues for identifying and engineering quantum Mpemba phenomena. Controlling relaxation dynamics through system-environment entanglement may have potential applications in quantum thermal machines, state initialization protocols, and quantum information processing, where precise control over thermalization is essential.</p>

            <p>We introduce two quantitative measures of the strength of causal relations in quantum theory and more general physical theories. These two measures, called the maximum and minimum causal effect, quantify the maximum and minimum changes in the output of a quantum process induced by changes in its input. The maximum and minimum causal effects possess useful properties, such as continuity and data-processing inequality. In quantum theory, they have close connections with quantum information tasks. The maximum quantum causal effect can be used to detect quantum channels with nonzero capacity for transmitting classical information. The minimum causal effect can be used to guarantee the recoverability of quantum information: every quantum process with a high value of the minimum quantum causal effect can be approximately inverted. Moreover, we show that the quantum causal effects satisfy a duality relation: if the minimum causal effect of a quantum system $A$ on another quantum system $B$ is high, then $A$ must have a low value of the maximum causal effect on any other quantum system $B'$ that is spacelike separated with $B$. This duality implies a monogamy relation for quantum causal effects and represents a fundamental difference between quantum and classical causal relations. We illustrate the application of the maximum causal effect to the analysis of two paradigmatic examples, the first involving a coherent superposition of direct cause and common cause, and the second involving a coherent superposition of multiple quantum processes.</p>

However, this complexity poses significant fabrication challenges, particularly in achieving high yield and junction uniformity with traditional methods. Here, we introduce an overlap process for Josephson junction fabrication that achieves nearly 100% yield and maintains uniformity across a 2-inch wafer with less than 5% variation for the phase slip junction and less than 2% for the entire junction array. We use a compact junction array design that achieves state-of-the-art dielectric loss tangents and flux noise levels, as confirmed by multiple devices.

            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is crucial to the occurrence of phase transitions. Once a phase transition occurs, a quantum system presents degenerate eigenstates that lack the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. After crossing the critical point, the system is essentially evolved to a quantum superposition of these eigenstates until decoherence sets in. Despite the fundamental importance and potential applications in quantum technologies, such quantum-mechanical SSB phenomena have not been experimentally explored in many-body systems. We here present an experimental demonstration of the SSB process in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, governed by the competition between the individual driving and intra-qubit interaction. The model is realized in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where 6 Xmon qubits are coupled in an all-to-all manner through virtual photon exchange mediated by a resonator. The observed nonclassical correlations among these qubits in the symmetry-breaking region go beyond the conventional description of SSB, shedding new light on phase transitions for quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Designing an operational architecture for the Quantum Internet is challenging in light of both fundamental limits imposed by physics laws and technological constraints. Here, we propose a method to abstract away most of the quantum-specific elements and formulate a best-effort quantum network architecture based on packet switching, akin to that of the classical Internet. This reframing provides an opportunity to exploit the many available and well-understood protocols within the Internet context. As an illustration, we tailor and adapt classical congestion control and active queue management protocols to quantum networks, employing an architecture wherein quantum end and intermediate nodes effectively regulate demand and resource utilization, respectively. Results show that these classical networking tools can be effective in managing quantum memory decoherence and maintaining end-to-end fidelity around a target value.</p>

            <h2>Scalable and modular generation of multipartite entangled states through memory-enhanced fusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jixuan Shi, Sheng Zhang, Yukai Wu, Yuedong Sun, Yibo Liang, Hai Wang, Yunfei Pu, Luming Duan</p>
            <p>Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a critical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially-separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We further transfer the W state from the memory qubits to the photonic qubits, and confirm the genuine four-partite entanglement through witness measurements. We then demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way towards realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.</p>

            <h2>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a nontrivial generalization of the mechanism in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. We particularly reach two novel models, with one hosting all basic types of mobility edges and the other hosting all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</p>

            <p>The last two decades has seen quantum thermodynamics become a well established field of research in its own right. In that time, it has demonstrated a remarkably broad applicability, ranging from providing foundational advances in the understanding of how thermodynamic principles apply at the nano-scale and in the presence of quantum coherence, to providing a guiding framework for the development of efficient quantum devices. Exquisite levels of control have allowed state-of-the-art experimental platforms to explore energetics and thermodynamics at the smallest scales which has in turn helped to drive theoretical advances.

            <h2>Generalized Pulse Design in Floquet Engineering: Application to Interacting Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Scott, Bryce Gadway, V. W. Scarola</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high frequency pulses to dynamically design steady state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a non-stroboscopic high frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</p>

            <p>Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan van Eeden, Marc M. Dignam</p>
            <p>We present an efficient and accurate method for modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in lossy coupled-cavity systems. We apply our approach to the design and modeling of a multimode photonic crystal coupled-cavity system for the generation of entangled squeezed states of light on-chip. The system consists of a three-mode, three-defect resonant structure coupled to three coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) in a square lattice silicon photonic crystal slab. We model the system using a basis of 184 non-orthogonal lossy quasi-modes. A two-mode squeezed thermal state of light is generated via degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing in the resonant structure, which is pumped with a Gaussian pulse via a pump-CROW. The generated entangled signal and idler pulses of light are coupled out of the resonant structure into the two output-CROWs. Due to careful design of the resonant structure and the CROWs, the signal and idler light in the two output CROWs remains entangled even after propagating tens of cavities down the CROWs. Our approach is general and computationally efficient and thus can be applied to modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in a wide variety of coupled-cavity photonic structures.</p>

            <p>Generating entanglement deterministically at a capacity-approaching rate is critical for next-generation quantum networks. We propose weak-coherent-state-assisted protocols that can generate entanglement near-deterministically between reflective-cavity-based quantum memories at a success rate that exceeds the 50\% limit associated with single-photon-mediated schemes. The most pronounced benefit is shown in the low-channel-loss regime and persists even with moderate noise. We extend our protocols to entangle an array of memories in a GHZ state, and infer that it yields an exponential speed-up compared to previous single-photon-based protocols.</p>

            <p>The Petz recovery map provides a near-optimal reversal of quantum noise, yet proposals for its implementation are only recent. We propose a physical realization of the exact state-specific Petz map in an ion trap for qubit decoherence channels. Our circuit constructions require at most $1 (2)$ ancilla qubits and $3 (20)$ CNOT gates for channels with Kraus rank $2 (>2)$. We analyze typical ion trap errors and construct corresponding Petz maps, simulating their performance under realistic noise modeled by residual spin-motion coupling. Quantum circuits are provided for depolarizing, dephasing, and amplitude damping channels. Focusing on single-shot recovery, suited for present-day devices, we also quantify the precision of prior knowledge required to achieve a recovery error below 0.01 across varying decoherence levels and state purities.</p>

            <p>Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memory-less quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}>6.4$ ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Borges, Thomas Schnappinger, Markus Kowalewski</p>
            <p>Polaritonic chemistry investigates the possible modification of chemical and photochemical reactions by means of strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities, as demonstrated in numerous experiments over the last few years. These experiments are typically interpreted in terms of the Jaynes-Cummings or Tavis-Cummings models under the assumption that the molecular ensemble is only excited by a single photon. In such a model, two polariton states compete with an overwhelming number of dark states, inhibiting polaritonic reactions entropically. We analyze the higher excitation manifolds of the Tavis-Cummings model along with a three-level system that resembles photochemical reactions. We demonstrate that allowing for more than a single excitation makes the reaction of the involved polaritons entropically more favorable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. R. Berman (1), A. Kuzmich (1), P. W Milonni (2) ((1) University of Michigan, (2) University of Rochester)</p>
            <p>A Schrödinger-picture approach is used to calculate the field energy and angular momentum radiated by an atom undergoing spontaneous emission. The calculation is carried out using both the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). It is shown that a consistent application of the WWA leads to expressions for both the energy and angular momentum in the field that are finite for all times, in contrast to the results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Moreover, it is shown that the total angular momentum in the field is a sum of its spin and orbital components, again in contrast to the analogous results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Analytic expressions for the energy, spin angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum in the field are obtained for an atom undergoing spontaneous emission from a state having angular momentum H to a state having angular momentum G via an electric dipole transition. It is shown that the spin and orbital angular momenta in the field are equal, independent of the values of H and G. With a slight modification of the WWA, it can also be shown that the energy density in the field, the Poynting vector of the field, and the angular momentum flux of the field do not diverge at the origin.</p>

            <p>Quantum communication has the potential to revolutionize information processing, providing unparalleled security and increased capacity compared to its classical counterpart by using the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the presence of noise remains a major barrier to realizing these advantages. While strategies like quantum error correction and mitigation have been developed to address this challenge, they often come with substantial overhead in physical qubits or sample complexity, limiting their practicality for large-scale information transfer. Here, we present an alternative approach: applying machine learning frameworks from natural language processing to enhance the performance of noisy quantum communications, focusing on superdense coding. By employing bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), a model known for its capabilities in natural language processing, we demonstrate improvements in information transfer efficiency without resorting to conventional error correction or mitigation techniques. These results mark a step toward the practical realization of a scalable and resilient quantum internet.</p>

            <p>We provide a complete characterization of the class of multimode quantum Gaussian states that can be reduced to a tensor product of thermal states using only a passive unitary operator. We call these states \textit{passive unitary normalizable} (PUN) Gaussian states. The characterization of PUN Gaussian states is given in three different ways: $(i)$ in terms of their covariance matrices, $(ii)$ using gauge-invariance (a special class of Glauber--Sudarshan $p$-functions), and $(iii)$ with respect to the recently obtained $(A,\Lambda)$ parametrization of Gaussian states in [J. Math. Phys. 62, 022102 (2021)]. In terms of the covariance matrix, our characterization states that an $n$-mode quantum Gaussian state is PUN if and only if its $2n\times 2n$ quantum covariance matrix $S$ commutes with the standard symplectic matrix $J$. It is well-known that the so-called gauge-invariant Gaussian states are PUN, but whether the converse is true is not known in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We establish the converse in affirmation. Lastly, in terms of the $(A,\Lambda)$-parameterization, we show that a Gaussian state with parameters $(A,\Lambda)$ is PUN if and only if $A=0$.</p>

Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Linear optical architectures have been extensively investigated for quantum computing and quantum machine learning applications. Recently, proposals for photonic quantum machine learning have combined linear optics with resource adaptivity, such as adaptive circuit reconfiguration, which promises to enhance expressivity and improve algorithm performances and scalability. Moreover, linear optical platforms preserve some subspaces due to the fixed number of particles during the computation, a property recently exploited to design a novel quantum convolutional neural networks. This last architecture has shown an advantage in terms of running time complexity and of the number of parameters needed with respect to other quantum neural network proposals. In this work, we design and experimentally implement the first photonic quantum convolutional neural network (PQCNN) architecture based on particle-number preserving circuits equipped with state injection, an approach recently proposed to increase the controllability of linear optical circuits. Subsequently, we experimentally validate the PQCNN for a binary image classification on a photonic platform utilizing a semiconductor quantum dot-based single-photon source and programmable integrated photonic interferometers comprising 8 and 12 modes. In order to investigate the scalability of the PQCNN design, we have performed numerical simulations on datasets of different sizes. We highlight the potential utility of a simple adaptive technique for a nonlinear Boson Sampling task, compatible with near-term quantum devices.</p>

The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits.

            <p>We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) that allows a large quantum circuit to be executed simultaneously on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) becomes a promising approach to increase the scalability of quantum computing. It is natural to envision the near-future DQC platform as a multi-tenant cluster of QPUs, called a Quantum Cloud. However, no existing DQC work has addressed the two key problems of running DQC in a multi-tenant quantum cloud: placing multiple quantum circuits to QPUs and scheduling network resources to complete these jobs. This work is the first attempt to design a circuit placement and resource scheduling framework for a multi-tenant environment. The proposed framework is called CloudQC, which includes two main functional components, circuit placement and network scheduler, with the objectives of optimizing both quantum network cost and quantum computing time. Experimental results with real quantum circuit workloads show that CloudQC significantly reduces the average job completion time compared to existing DQC placement algorithms for both single-circuit and multi-circuit DQC. We envision this work will motivate more future work on network-aware quantum cloud.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermiticity appears ubiquitously in various open classical and quantum systems and enriches classification of topological phases. However, the role of nonsymmorphic symmetry, crystalline symmetry accompanying fractional lattice translations, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we systematically classify non-Hermitian topological crystalline phases protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry and reveal unique phases that have no counterparts in either Hermitian topological crystalline phases or non-Hermitian topological phases protected solely by internal symmetry. Specifically, we elucidate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ non-Hermitian topological phases and their associated anomalous boundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network For Remaining Useful Life Prediction</h2>

            <p>Predictive maintenance in aerospace heavily relies on accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of jet engines. In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network frame- work, combining Quantum Long Short-Term Memory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset. Each Quantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear transformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to learn high-frequency components more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent Neural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough comparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our approach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these baselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively. Nevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures. Our findings highlight the poten- tial of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for robust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new avenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.</p>

            <h2>Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in Silicon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Gawełczyk, K. Gawarecki</p>
            <p>Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.</p>

            <p>We propose a procedure to identify and classify genuine tripartite entanglement in pure 3-qubit states via the Activated Bipartite Entanglement (ABE), which is defined here as the difference between the Entanglement of Assistance and the Entanglement of Formation. We show that for pure states belonging to one of the two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e., GHZ or W states, the ABE is always greater than zero. For separable and biseparable states it is always null. In addition, our approach is capable to distinguish between genuine tripartite entangled states, those belonging to the GHZ-class from those belonging to the W-class. We also present an experimental proposal, by using linear optical circuits and internal degrees of freedom of a single photon, to measure the ABE and to verify the characterization via activated entanglement. The circuit simulation shows an excellent agreement with theoretical prediction for a wide class of GHZ and W states.</p>

            <p>Qubit noise spectroscopy is an important tool for the experimental investigation of open quantum systems. However, conventional techniques for noise spectroscopy are time-consuming, because they require measurements of the noise spectral density at many different frequencies. Here we describe an alternative approach to noise spectroscopy, which requires fewer resources, and relies on direct measurement of arbitrary linear functionals of the noise spectral density. This method uses random pulse sequences with carefully-controlled correlations, which are chosen using algorithms for phase retrieval. These measurements allow us to reconstruct sparse noise spectra via compressed sensing. Our simulations of the performance of the random pulse sequences on a realistic physical system, self-assembled quantum dots, reveal a speedup of an order of magnitude in extracting the noise spectrum, compared to conventional dynamical decoupling approaches.</p>

            <h2>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark Xin Hong Goh</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erdös--Rényi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</p>

            <p>In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of popular SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers (that is transpilers that takes a quantum circuit from an initial SDK and output a quantum circuit in another SDK), focusing on critical metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time. To ensure unbiased evaluation and accommodate diverse quantum computing scenarios, we developed two dedicated tools: RandomQC, for generating random quantum circuits across various types (pure random, VQE-like, and SDK-specific circuits), and Benchmarq, to streamline the benchmarking process. Using these tools, we benchmarked prominent quantum transpilers as of February 2024. Our results highlight the superior performance of the qiskit-braket-provider, a specialized transpiler from Qiskit to Braket, achieving a remarkably low failure rate of 0.2%. The qBraid-SDK, offering generalized transpilation across multiple SDKs, demonstrated robust but slower performance. The pytket extensions, while fast, faced limitations with complex circuits due to their one-to-one transpilation approach. In particular, the exceptional performance of the qiskit-bracket-provider stems not only from its specialization but also from its architecture, which combines one-to-one transpilation with gate decomposition for unsupported gates, enhancing both speed and capability. This study aims to provide practical guidelines to users of SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers and guidance to developers for improving the design and development of future tools.</p>

            <p>An efficient implementation of the Toffoli gate is of conceptual importance for running various quantum algorithms, including Grover's search and Shor's integer factorization. However, direct implementation of the Toffoli gate either entails a prohibitive increase in the number of two-qubit gates or requires ancilla qubits, whereas both of these resources are limited in the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable $N$-qubit Toffoli gate improvement using $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ trapped-ion-based optical-metastable-ground encoded qutrits for the cases of up to $N$=10. With the use of the Molmer-Sorensen gate as a basic entangling operation, we compare the standard qubit decomposition with the qutrit approach, where upper levels are used as this http URL presented decomposition requires only global control of the ancilla levels, which simplifies experimental implementation of the proposed approach. Using the example of a three-qubit Grover's search, we also demonstrate an increase in the algorithm's accuracy by monitoring the leakage from the qubit subspace during a qutrit-based Toffoli gate implementation.</p>

            <p>Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</p>

            <p>Block Encoding (BE) is a crucial subroutine in many modern quantum algorithms, including those with near-optimal scaling for simulating quantum many-body systems, which often rely on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings. Using LOVE-LCU to implement the BE, we simulate the time evolution of single-site and two-site systems in the lattice $\varphi^4$ theory using the Generalized QSP algorithm and compare the gate counts to those required for Trotter simulation.</p>

            <p>Quantum control plays a crucial role in enhancing precision scaling for quantum sensing. However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with imperfect clocks, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg scaling up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.</p>

            <p>Extending the phase-space description of the Weyl-Wigner quantum mechanics to a subset of non-linear Hamiltonians in position and momentum, gaussian functions are identified as the quantum ground state. Once a Hamiltonian, $H^{W}(q,\,p)$, is constrained by the $\partial ^2 H^{W} / \partial q \partial p = 0$ condition, flow properties for generic $1$-dim systems can be analytically obtained in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. For gaussian statistical ensembles, the exact phase-space profile of the quantum fluctuations over the classical trajectories are found, so to interpret them as a suitable Hilbert space state configuration for confronting quantum and classical regimes. In particular, a sort of {\em quantum camouflage} where the stationarity of classical statistical ensembles can be camouflaged by the stationarity of gaussian quantum ensembles is identified. Besides the broadness of the framework worked out in some previous examples, our results provide an encompassing picture of quantum effects on non-linear dynamical systems which can be interpreted as a first step for finding the complete spectrum of non-standard Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>Shadow estimation is a sample-efficient protocol for learning the properties of a quantum system using randomized measurements, but the current understanding of qudit shadow estimation is quite limited compared with the qubit setting. Here we clarify the sample complexity of qudit shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, where the local dimension $d$ is an odd prime. Notably, we show that the overhead of qudit shadow estimation over the qubit counterpart is only $\mathcal{O}(d)$, independent of the qudit number $n$, although the set of stabilizer states may deviate exponentially from a 3-design with respect to the third moment operator. Furthermore, by adding one layer of magic gates, we propose a simple circuit that can significantly boost the efficiency. Actually, a single magic gate can already eliminate the $\mathcal{O}(d)$ overhead in qudit shadow estimation and bridge the gap from the qubit setting.</p>

Here we propose the implementation of space-based quantum sensing to explore ultralight new particles beyond the standard model. The central idea involves probing long-range interactions between spin ensembles of space quantum sensors and the particles residing within Earth, mediated by ultralight particles. We show that such interactions can be substantially enhanced in space platforms and thus increase the search sensitivity. In contrast to their terrestrial counterparts, space-based quantum searches exhibit remarkable velocity enhancements, approaching the first cosmic speed, and thus enables the exploration of unexplored parameter space concerning ultralight new particles. Furthermore, the substantial abundance of electrons and nucleons within Earth plays a crucial role in extending the scope of our mission. Our projected search sensitivity can surpass the sensitivities of both terrestrial experiments and proposals by up to approximately 7 orders of magnitude. We also briefly discuss other space mission, including ``space-ground integrated" network of quantum sensors for dark matter searches.</p>

            <p>Trapped ion systems present non-classical characteristics such as squeezed states that show a quantum advantage in quantum sensing, quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics. We analyze the non-classical characteristics of a system described by a single ion trapped by a periodic potential field. Within the regime of non-adiabatic manipulation of the potential field, the dynamics of motion of the center of mass of the ion can be described by a dimensionless parameter called the non-adiabatic parameter $Q^{*}$. This parameter allows us to distinguish the classical and non-classical characteristics of the system. Using the equations of motion of observables in the Heisenberg picture, we propose an analysis of the unitary time evolution operator and discuss the squeezing behavior in the state of motion of the ion. The results shown can serve as a basis to discuss the presence of squeezing as a resource in quantum thermodynamics in the non-adiabatic regime in actual achievable experimental limitations.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as a critical quantum resource in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth depends on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer with a movable membrane. This configuration enables the switching between coherent and dissipative optomechanical couplings at will. With experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power under coherent (dissipative) coupling. Furthermore, we show that the quantum entanglement generated via dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more robust to noise than that generated via coherent coupling. When both coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously present, the entanglement is weakened due to quantum interference. Our results indicate that dissipative optomechanical coupling can be a promising route for engineering strong and noise-resilient quantum entanglement.</p>

We then apply our theory to the study of the optical response of two plasmonic systems. Furthermore, by exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Polarization-entangled photons are the key ingredients of various protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. A near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is essential to minimize qubit error rates in key distribution. This study theoretically investigates the polarization entangled photon pairs produced by a quantum-dot radiative cascade located within a micropillar cavity. To incorporate the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling in a quantum dot-cavity system, we develop a polaron master equation theory and investigate how it affects the degree of entanglement and qubit error rate. We derive analytical expressions of various phonon-induced incoherent rates and demonstrate that one-photon incoherent rates predominate, substantially diminishing the degree of entanglement. It is shown that at elevated temperatures, the role of cavity-mediated effects such as cross-coupling between exciton states, ac-Stark shift, and multiphoton emission gets reduced owing to the phonon-mediated renormalization of the cavity coupling and Rabi frequency. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol and show the evolution of qubit error rate at elevated temperatures of the phonon bath.</p>

            <p>We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.</p>

Drawing natural motivations from the study of quantum phases of matter and entanglement, we systematically investigate the notion of long-range magic (LRM), defined as nonstabilizerness that cannot be (approximately) erased by shallow local unitary circuits. In doing so, we prove a robust generalization of the Bravyi--König theorem. By establishing connections to the theory of fault-tolerant logical gates on quantum error-correcting codes, we show that certain families of topological stabilizer code states exhibit LRM. Then, we show that all ground states of topological orders that cannot be realized by topological stabilizer codes, such as Fibonacci topological order, exhibit LRM, which yields a ``no lowest-energy trivial magic'' result. Building on our considerations of LRM, we discuss the classicality of short-range magic from e.g.~preparation and learning perspectives, and put forward a ``no low-energy trivial magic'' (NLTM) conjecture that has key motivation in the quantum PCP context. We also connect correlation functions with LRM, demonstrating certain LRM state families by correlation properties. Most of our concepts and techniques do not rely on geometric locality and can be extended to systems with general connectivity. Our study leverages and sheds new light on the interplay between quantum resources, error correction and fault tolerance, complexity theory, and many-body physics.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Monitoring of Multimode Squeezing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Kalash, Aditya Sudharsanam, M. H. M. Passos, Valentina Parigi, Maria Chekhova</p>
            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of up to $7.9 \pm 0.6$ dB, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest squeezing recorded for pulsed light. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum random numbers are essential for security against quantum algorithms. Randomness as a beacon is a service being provided for companies and governments to upgrade their security standards from RSA to PQC-QKD or PQC-RSA protocols. Both security mechanisms assume trust in the service provider unless one aims for device-independent protocols. How does an entity ensure that the beacon service has a quantum signature other than relying on faith? Specifically, given a bit-stream, can a user verify a quantum signature in it? Researchers claim this is indecipherable and have stated a no-go theorem for post-processed bit-streams [Physical Review A \textbf{109}, 022243 (2024)]. In this article, we corroborate the results of the no-go theorem while discussing its nuances using two different random number generators and four test methods. These include the NIST statistical test suite and machine learning algorithms that strengthen the theorem. This work is relevant for companies and governments using QRNG, provided to enhance security against quantum threats.</p>

            <h2>Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xulong Wang, Guancong Ma</p>
            <p>The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other. However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes. Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in non-Hermitian phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Reducing quantum error correction overhead using soft information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonas Majaniemi, Elisha S. Matekole</p>
            <p>Imperfect measurements are a prevalent source of error across quantum computing platforms, significantly degrading the logical error rates achievable on current hardware. To mitigate this issue, rich measurement data referred to as soft information has been proposed to efficiently identify and correct measurement errors as they occur. In this work, we model soft information decoding across a variety of physical qubit platforms and decoders and showcase how soft information can make error correction viable at lower code distances and higher physical error rates than is otherwise possible. We simulate the effects of soft information decoding on quantum memories for surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes, and evaluate the error suppression performance of soft decoders against traditional decoders. For near-term devices with noise regimes close to the surface code threshold, our simulations show that soft information decoding can provide up to 10% higher error suppression on superconducting qubits and up to 20% stronger error suppression on neutral atom qubits.</p>

            <p>Multi-target gates offer the potential to reduce gate depth in syndrome extraction for quantum error correction. Although neutral-atom quantum computers have demonstrated native multi-qubit gates, existing approaches that avoid additional control or multiple atomic species have been limited to single-target gates. We propose single-control-multi-target CZ^{\otimes N}) gates on a single-species neutral-atom platform that require no extra control and have gate durations comparable to standard CZ gates. Our approach leverages tailored interatomic distances to create an asymmetric blockade between the control and target atoms. Using a GPU-accelerated pulse synthesis protocol, we design smooth control pulses for CZZ and CZZZ gates, achieving fidelities of up to 99.55% and 99.24%, respectively, even in the presence of simulated atom placement errors and Rydberg-state decay. This work presents a practical path to implementing multi-target gates in neutral-atom systems, significantly reducing the resource overhead for syndrome extraction.</p>

            <p>We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</p>

            <p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations and identifying governing equations from observational data. In this study, we apply PINNs to investigate vortex-type solutions of quasi-integrable equations in two spatial dimensions, specifically the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equations. These equations are toy models for geostrophic shallow water dynamics in planetary atmospheres. We first demonstrate that PINNs can successfully solve these equations in the forward process using a mesh-free approach with automatic differentiation. However, in the inverse process, substantial misidentification occurs due to the structural similarities between the ZK and the RLW equations. To address this issue, we then introduce conservation law-enhanced PINNs, initial condition variations, and a friction-based perturbation approach to improve identification accuracy. Our results show that incorporating small perturbations while preserving conservation laws significantly enhances the resolution of equation identification. These findings may contribute to the broader goal of using deep learning techniques for discovering governing equations in complex fluid dynamical systems, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-André-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents. The bulk-boundary correspondence is investigated by analyzing the existence of localized edge states under the open boundary condition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhikbrata Sarkar, Pratik Chowdhury, Xuedong Hu, Andre Saraiva, A. S. Dzurak, A. R. Hamilton, Rajib Rahman, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</p>

            <p>Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</p>

When the bath combines both thermal fluctuations and a nonclassical feature like quadrature squeezing, forming a squeezed thermal reservoir, the system's behaviour can change substantially. In this work, we study the evolution of the cavity field in this generalized environment using an alternative phase-space approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We derive a compact analytical expression for the time-dependent $P$-function for arbitrary initial cavity field states and demonstrate its utility through specific examples. Additionally, we obtain analytical expressions, as a function of time, for some statistical properties of the cavity field, as well as for the nonclassical depth, $\tau_m$, a nonclassicality measure calculated directly from the $P$-function.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waltraut Wustmann, Kevin D. Osborn</p>
            <p>The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</p>

Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi Model to a sum over $n$ binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with $n$ spin sites, where $n$ is also the number of steps in Trotter's formula. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice-versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.</p>

            <p>Given a finite lifetime, a ubiquitous challenge in quantum systems is how to prepare a target state in the shortest possible time. This issue is particularly relevant for Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers where the dephasing time is typically restricted to a few microseconds. In this work, we develop a rapid passage to ordered many-body states in a Rydberg atomic chain, which allows the transition of the system to various ordered phases in the phase diagram, such as the Z$_2$-, Z$_3$-, and Z$_4$-ordered antiferromagnetic states. Our scheme ramps the parameter in a "non-adiabatic to quasi-adiabatic to non-adiabatic (NQN)" manner. The NQN configuration significantly reduces the time cost required for the state preparation using entirely adiabatic methods, and is generally appliable to sizable number of atoms. Moreover, we experimentally validate the NQN scheme on the neutral-atom quantum cloud computer Aquila.</p>

            <p>Trapped-ion qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum computing, quantum information processing, and quantum simulation. In general, trapped ions are considered to have sufficiently long coherence times, which are mainly characterized under laser-free conditions. However, in reality, essential laser fields for quantum manipulation introduce residual light shift, which seriously degrades the coherence due to power fluctuations. Here, we present a comprehensive study of AC Stark shifts in the hyperfine energy levels of the $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ ion, revealing an asymmetric light shift between two circular polarizations in the clock qubit and pronounced vector light shifts in the Zeeman qubits. By precisely tuning these polarizations, a remarkable enhancement in coherence time is observed, reaching over a hundredfold for the clock qubit and more than tenfold for the Zeeman qubits, when comparing conditions of maximum and minimum shifts. These findings advance the practical realization of scalable trapped-ion quantum processors, enabling deep quantum circuit execution and long duration adiabatic operations.</p>

            <p>Spatial entanglement is a key resource in quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum communication, imaging, and computation. However, propagation through complex media distorts spatial correlations, posing a challenge for practical implementations. We introduce a symmetrized genetic algorithm (sGA) for adaptive wavefront correction of spatially entangled photons, leveraging the insight that only the even-parity component of wavefront distortions affects two-photon correlations. By enforcing symmetry constraints, sGA reduces the optimization parameter space by half, leading to faster convergence and improved enhancement within finite number of generations compared to standard genetic algorithms (GA). Additionally, we establish the dependence of enhancement on the signal-to-noise ratio of the feedback signal, which is controlled by detector integration time. This technique enables correction of entanglement degradation, enhancing quantum imaging, secure quantum communication, and quantum sensing in complex environments.</p>

However, their internal mechanisms are poorly understood, hindering our ability to ensure their reliability and security against adversarial attacks. Leading machine learning decoders utilize recurrent and transformer models (e.g., AlphaQubit), with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a key role in training advanced transformer models (e.g., DeepSeek R1). In this work, we target a basic RL surface code decoder (DeepQ) to create the first adversarial attack on quantum error correction. By applying state-of-the-art white-box methods, we uncover vulnerabilities in this decoder, demonstrating an attack that reduces the logical qubit lifetime in memory experiments by up to five orders of magnitude. We validate that this attack exploits a genuine weakness, as the decoder exhibits robustness against noise fluctuations, is largely unaffected by substituting the referee decoder, responsible for episode termination, with an MWPM decoder, and demonstrates fault tolerance at checkable code distances. This attack highlights the susceptibility of machine learning-based QEC and underscores the importance of further research into robust QEC methods.</p>

            <h2>Efficient quantum state preparation through seniority driven operator selection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dipanjali Halder, Dibyendu Mondal, Rahul Maitra</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithms require accurate representations of electronic states on a quantum device, yet the approximation of electronic wave functions for strongly correlated systems remains a profound theoretical challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance the competing demands of chemical accuracy and gate efficiency. Moreover, a critical limitation of the most of the state-of-the-art methods developed to date lies in their substantial reliance on extensive pre-circuit measurements, which introduce significant overheads and contribute to inefficiencies in practical implementation. To address these interconnected challenges and establish a harmonious synergy between them, we propose an algorithmic framework that focuses on efficiently capturing the molecular strong correlation through an ordered set of computationally less demanding rank-one and seniority-zero excitations, yielding a parameterized ansatz with shallow gate depth. Furthermore, to achieve minimal pre-circuit measurement overhead, we implement a selective pruning of excitations through a hybrid approach that combines intuition-based selection with shallow-depth, rank-one excitations driven uni-parameter circuit optimization strategy. With the incorporation of qubit-based excitations via particle-preserving exchange circuits, we demonstrate a further reduction in quantum complexities, enhancing the overall resource efficiency of the approach. With a range of challenging applications on strongly correlated systems, we demonstrate that our dynamic ansatz not only significantly enhances computational efficiency but also delivers exceptional accuracy, robustness, and resilience to the noisy environments inherent in near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is paramount in quantum information processing. Many quantum systems suffer from spatial decoherence in distances over a wavelength and cannot be sustained over short time periods due to dissipation. However, long range solutions are required for the development of quantum information processing on chip. Photonic reservoirs mediating the interactions between qubits and their environment are suggested. Recent research takes advantage of extended wavelength inside near-zero refractive index media to solve the long-range problem along with less sensitivity on the position of quantum emitters. However, those recent proposals use plasmonic epsilon near-zero waveguides that are intrinsically lossy. Here, we propose a fully dielectric platform, compatible with the Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) diamond centers on-chip technology, to drastically improve the range of entanglement over 17 free-space wavelengths, or approximatively 12.5 microns, using mu near-zero metamaterials. We evaluate transient and steady state concurrence demonstrating an order of magnitude enhancement compared to previous works. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a long distance is reported using this strategy. Moreover, value of the zero time delay second order correlation function g_12^((2)) (0) are provided, showing antibunching signature correlated with a high degree of concurrence.</p>

In contrast to previous works on the relation of quantum and classical perturbation theories, our approach is not based on the conceptual similarities between the two methods. Instead, we show that for quantum systems with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, the Van Vleck-Primas procedure can be recast exactly into a classical perturbation problem. As a non-obvious consequence, this approach gives a new way of calculating the geometric phase of quantum systems using tools from the theory of classical canonical transformations</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Ichikawa</p>
            <p>We present a comparative study between classical probability and quantum probability from the Bayesian viewpoint, where probability is construed as our rational degree of belief on whether a given statement is true. From this viewpoint, including conditional probability, three issues are discussed: i) Given a measure of the rational degree of belief, does it satisfy the axioms of the probability? ii) Given the probability satisfying these axioms, is it seen as the measure of the rational degree of belief? iii) Can the measure of the rational degree of belief be evaluated in terms of the relative frequency of events occurring? Here we show that as with the classical probability, all these issues can be resolved affirmatively in the quantum probability, provided that the relation to the relative frequency is slightly modified from the Laplace law of succession in case of a small number of observations. This implies that the relation between the Bayesian probability and the relative frequency in quantum mechanics is the same as that in the classical probability theory, including conditional probability.</p>

Employing an IonQ quantum computer, we apply this scheme to the toric ladder, a quasi-one-dimensional reduction of the toric code. We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The ability to generate entangled states of light is a key primitive for quantum communication and distributed quantum computation. Continuously driven sources, including those based on spontaneous parametric downconversion, are usually probabilistic, whereas deterministic sources require accurate timing of the control fields. Here, we experimentally generate entangled photonic modes by continuously exciting a quantum emitter, a superconducting qubit, with a coherent drive, taking advantage of mode matching in the time and frequency domain. Using joint quantum state tomography and logarithmic negativity, we show that entanglement is generated between modes extracted from the two sidebands of the resonance fluorescence spectrum. Because the entangled photonic modes are perfectly orthogonal, they can be transferred into distinct quantum memories. Our approach can be utilized to distribute entanglement at a high rate in various physical platforms, with applications in waveguide quantum electrodynamics, distributed quantum computing, and quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up, due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine the necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</p>

Matheny, Oskar Painter</p>
            <p>Cat qubits, a type of bosonic qubit encoded in a harmonic oscillator, can exhibit an exponential noise bias against bit-flip errors with increasing mean photon number. Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic oscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large loss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade the coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to overcome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode with a multi-pole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account additional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve near-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon number, reaching over $0.1$ seconds with a mean photon number of only $4$. Concurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip times corresponding to an effective lifetime of $T_{1,\text{eff}} \simeq 70$ $\mu$s, comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this performance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out the cat qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive coupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode allows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control primitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction (e.g., two thirds) of a $3~\mathrm{\mu s}$ cycle without degrading bit-flip times. These advances are important for the realization of scalable error-correction with cat qubits, where large noise bias and low phase-flip error rate enable the use of hardware-efficient outer error-correcting codes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo: A Hybrid Approach to Data Assimilation in 4DVAR</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhiram Sripat</p>
            <p>We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QMCMC) with variational particle filters to tackle the computational challenges in Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation (4DVAR). 4DVAR, widely used in numerical weather prediction, suffers from inefficiencies in high-dimensional, non-linear systems. Our approach, the Quantum Variational Particle Filter (QVPF), uses QAOA to optimize particle proposals and QMCMC to efficiently compute particle weights and resample, accelerating convergence while reducing the computational load. The QVPF framework addresses the curse of dimensionality by minimizing the number of particles required for accurate state estimation, thus improving efficiency in systems with complex dynamics. The hybrid model offers enhanced accuracy by integrating quantum algorithms into the variational particle filter, making it particularly suited for applications in climate modeling, space weather prediction, and defense. The potential for achieving unprecedented resolution in predictive models could transform sectors that rely on high-resolution forecasting. We present the mathematical foundations of the approach, along with discussions on algorithmic implementation and hardware requirements. Early results suggest that this hybrid framework could significantly improve data assimilation, with future implementations on near-term quantum devices offering a practical pathway for scaling up. This work demonstrates how quantum computing can address the growing need for more accurate and computationally feasible methods in large-scale data assimilation.</p>

These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</p>

These spins are uniformly coupled to an externally applied homogeneous magnetic field, which enables the NV centers to exert a measurable spin-dependent torque on the cantilever, driving its center of mass motion. Our experiment highlights the intricate interplay between the spin properties of NV centers and the mechanical behavior of the oscillator in the presence of a pure torque, providing a set of tools for exploring quantum effects in state of the art micro-mechanical systems.</p>

            <h2>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity: A perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anneswa Paul, Upendra Harbola</p>
            <p>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity and formation of polaritonic states have gained interest in the past decades as it has direct applications in many research fields. Different regimes of light-matter coupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is rotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling and near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \leq \lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \leq\lambda/\omega_c\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\lambda/\omega_c\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting has been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic states. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon coupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is not captured by RWA. In fact, RWA breaks down completely to predict the ground state properties as it fails to capture the interaction between the matter and the cavity field.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <p>The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha > 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha>3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.</p>

The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</p>

While current methods of solving Set Constraint Problems focus on classical techniques, we offer both a quantum-inspired matrix method and a quantum matrix method that neutralizes common contradictions and inconsistencies that appear in these types of problems. We then use our new method to show how a potential polynomial solution for NP-Complete problems could be found using quantum computation. We state this as a potential solution, rather than an actual solution, as the outcome of any quantum computation may not be the same as the expected outcome. We start by formally defining a Set Constraint Problem. We then explain current, classical methods that are used to solve these problems and the drawbacks of such methods. After this, we explain a new quantum-inspired matrix method that allows us to solve these problems, with classical limitations. Then, we explain a new quantum matrix method that solves these problems using quantum information science. Finally, we describe how we can extend this method to potentially solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time using quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Statistical noise enhances quantumness benefits in spin-network quantum reservoir computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youssef Kora, Christoph Simon</p>
            <p>Quantum reservoir computing offers a promising approach to the utilization of complex quantum dynamics in machine learning. Statistical noise inevitably arises in real settings of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) due to the practical necessity of taking a small to moderate number of measurements. We investigate the effect of statistical noise in spin-network QRC on the possible performance benefits conferred by quantumness. As our measures of quantumness, we employ both quantum entanglement, which we quantify by the partial transpose of the density matrix, and coherence, which we quantify as the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. We find that reservoirs which enjoy a finite degree of quantum entanglement and coherence are more stable against the adverse effects of statistical noise on performance compared to their unentangled, incoherent counterparts. Our results indicate that the potential benefit reservoir computers may derive from quantumness depends on the number of measurements used for training and testing, and may indeed be enhanced by statistical noise. These findings not only emphasize the importance of incorporating realistic noise models, but also suggest that the search for quantum advantage may be aided rather than impeded by the practical constraints of implementation within existing machines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoukang Chang, Marco G. Genoni, Francesco Albarelli</p>
            <p>Multiparameter quantum estimation theory is crucial for many applications involving infinite-dimensional Gaussian quantum systems, since they can describe many physical platforms, e.g., quantum optical and optomechanical systems and atomic ensembles. In the multiparameter setting, the most fundamental estimation error (quantified by the trace of the estimator covariance matrix) is given by the Holevo Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB), which takes into account the asymptotic detrimental impact of measurement incompatibility on the simultaneous estimation of parameters encoded in a quantum state. However, the difficulty of evaluating the HCRB for infinite-dimensional systems weakens the practicality of applying this tool in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an efficient numerical method to evaluate the HCRB for general Gaussian states, by solving a semidefinite program involving only the covariance matrix and first moment vector and their parametric derivatives. This approach follows similar techniques developed for finite-dimensional systems, and hinges on a phase-space evaluation of inner products between observables that are at most quadratic in the canonical bosonic operators. From this vantage point, we can also understand symmetric and right logarithmic derivative scalar Cramér-Rao bounds under the same common framework, showing how they can similarly be evaluated as semidefinite programs. To exemplify the relevance and applicability of this methodology, we consider two paradigmatic applications, where the parameter dependence appears both in the first moments and in the covariance matrix of Gaussian states: estimation of phase and loss, and estimation of squeezing and displacement.</p>

Our distributed computation harnessed up to $16\,384$ CPU cores and $512$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs, using $32$ TB of memory. The simulator significantly outperforms other high-performance libraries, showing a typical speedup of $10-100$ for large-scale multi-GPU workloads. As a first application of our approach, we report a numerical experiment aimed at simulating exactly Hamiltonian dynamics of up to 40 qubits to investigate the Trotter error for a quantum chemistry problem. Bounding the Trotter error is important for evaluating the cost of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and rigorous bounds are often conservative, as our simulations confirm.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arunangshu Debnath</p>
            <p>Cavity modulation of interacting molecular vibrational modes promises an expanded role of the characteristic vibrations to act as spectroscopic markers. In addition to the intrinsic, inter-mode and extrinsic, cavity-mediated inter-mode delocalization, the vibrational modes undergo multiscale relaxation due to reservoir vibrations. Two complementary coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques are presented, which reveal the dynamical nature of the mode correlations in the presence relaxation. Simulations are presented for finite laser pulses. The chosen cavity-vibron mode coupling strengths fall within the range of inter-vibrational mode coupling, hinting at a parameter regime where vibrational energy dispersal can be controlled. It is highlighted that the cavity manipulation of vibrational double excitations, namely, overtone and combination states, can offer deeper insights into the collective mode dynamics. These observations set the ground for cavity-controlled spectroscopic investigation of mode-selective dynamics, where localized electromagnetic modes function as an effective few-body coupler of vibrations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum squeezing of a levitated nanomechanical oscillator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Kamba, N. Hara, K. Aikawa</p>
            <p>Manipulating the motions of macroscopic objects near their quantum mechanical uncertainties has been desired in diverse fields, including fundamental physics, sensing, and transducers. Despite significant progresses in ground-state cooling of a levitated solid particle, realizing non-classical states of its motion has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate quantum squeezing of the motion of a single nanoparticle by rapidly varying its oscillation frequency. We reveal significant narrowing of the velocity variance to $-4.9(1)$~dB of that of the ground state via free-expansion measurements. To quantitatively confirm our finding, we develop a method to accurately measure the displacement of the nanoparticle by referencing an optical standing wave. Our work shows that a levitated nanoparticle offers an ideal platform for studying non-classical states of its motion and paves the way for its applications in quantum sensing, as well as for exploring quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum control over Rydberg atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>In this paper, the universal quantum control with error correction is applied to the generation of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of multiple Rydberg atoms, in which the qubits are encoded on the hyperfine ground levels. Our system is featured with the off-resonant driving fields rather than the strong Rydberg interaction sufficient for blockade. It can closely follow the designed nonadiabatic passage during the time evolution and avoid the unwanted transition by imposing the path-dependent and fast-varying global phase. A general GHZ state of $N$ Rydberg qubits can be prepared in $N-1$ steps, which is found to be robust against both environmental noises and systematic errors. Our protocol therefore provides an avenue towards large-scale entanglement, which is essential for quantum information and quantum computation based on neutral atoms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Learning Using Non-Integrable System Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryutaro Sato, Yasuhiro Aota, Takaharu Yoishida, Hideaki Kawaguchi, Yuichiro Mori, Hiroki Kuji, Yuichiro Matsuzaki</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning is an approach that aims to improve the performance of machine learning methods by leveraging the properties of quantum computers. In quantum circuit learning (QCL), a supervised learning method that can be implemented using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), the process of encoding input data into quantum states has been widely discussed for its important role on the expressive power of learning models. In particular, the properties of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian used for encoding significantly influence model performance. Recent encoding methods have demonstrated that the expressive power of learning models can be enhanced by applying exponentially large magnetic fields proportional to the number of qubits. However, this approach poses a challenge as it requires exponentially increasing magnetic fields, which are impractical for implementation in large-scale systems. Here, we propose a QCL method that leverages a non-integrable Hamiltonian for encoding, aiming to achieve both enhanced expressive power and practical feasibility. We find that the thermalization properties of non-integrable systems over long timescales, implying that the energy difference has a low probability to be degenerate, lead to an enhanced expressive power for QCL. Since the required magnetic field strength remains within a practical range, our approach to using the non-integrable system is suitable for large-scale quantum computers. Our results bridge the dynamics of non-integrable systems and the field of quantum machine learning, suggesting the potential for significant interdisciplinary contributions.</p>

            <h2>Efficient witnessing and testing of magic in mixed quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Haug, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a crucial resource for quantum computers which can be distilled from noisy quantum states. However, determining the magic of mixed quantum has been a notoriously difficult task. Here, we provide efficient witnesses of magic based on the stabilizer Rényi entropy which robustly indicate the presence of magic and quantitatively estimate magic monotones. We also design efficient property testing algorithms to reliably distinguish states with high and low magic, assuming the entropy is bounded. We apply our methods to certify the number of noisy T-gates under a wide class of noise models. Additionally, using the IonQ quantum computer, we experimentally verify the magic of noisy random quantum circuits. Surprisingly, we find that magic is highly robust, persisting even under exponentially strong noise. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, revealing that subsystems of many-body quantum states can contain extensive magic despite entanglement. Finally, our work also has direct implications for cryptography and pseudomagic: To mimic high magic states with as little magic as possible, one requires an extensive amount of entropy. This implies that entropy is a necessary resource to hide magic from eavesdroppers. Our work uncovers powerful tools to verify and study the complexity of noisy quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Talha Rahim, Saif Al-Kuwari, Mahmood Irtiza Hussain, Asad Ali</p>
            <p>Quantum resources enable secure quantum sensing (SQS) of remote systems, offering significant advantages in precision and security. However, decoherence in the quantum communication channel and during the evolution of quantum states can erode these advantages. In this work, we first propose a general $N-$particle scheme that achieves Heisenberg-limited (HL) scaling for single-parameter estimation in the presence of an ideal quantum communication channel and encoding scenario. For non-ideal dynamics, we introduce a modified protocol incorporating local quantum optimal control (QOC) operations to address noise in SQS under generalized Pauli dephasing and parallel dephasing noise. We analyze two distinct scenarios: a noiseless communication channel with noisy evolution, and a noisy communication channel with noisy evolution. For the noisy channel, we model the link between the communicating parties as a depolarizing channel. The protocol leverages QOC operations to actively mitigate noise, enhancing the achievable quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the classical Fisher information (CFI) based on the chosen measurement strategy.</p>

Both implementations reduce quantum radiation pressure noise and surpass the standard quantum limit of measuring displacement. We discuss potential applications to gravitational-wave detectors, where our scheme enhances low-frequency sensitivity without requiring modifications to the core optics of a conventional Michelson interferometer (e.g., substrate or coating properties).

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naphan Benchasattabuse, Michal Hajdušek, Rodney Van Meter</p>
            <p>We propose a purification-enhanced all-photonic quantum repeater scheme based on repeater graph states (RGS) framework that leverages the recently proposed half-RGS building block. This framework addresses a longstanding open question--how to naturally integrate entanglement purification with an all-photonic scheme--by enabling long-distance purification without disrupting the core design. Our framework utilizes optimistic purification performed directly on the half-RGS primitives across long distances without waiting for heralding outcomes. The overhead is modest: the RGS generation slows down proportionally with the number of purification rounds, and each round requires only one additional quantum emitter per half-RGS source. However, since the generation time is negligible compared to the end-to-end communication delay, the total latency remains effectively dominated by communication time, similar to frameworks without purification. Our framework enables flexible purification scheduling along the connection path, making it compatible with memory-based strategies, a rich body of research on purification scheduling and optimization that was previously thought inapplicable to the RGS scheme. Through numerical evaluation, we compare the performance of our framework with purification between memories at end nodes.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensor networks (QSNs) have been widely studied for their potential of precise measurements. While most QSN research has focused on estimating continuous variables, recent studies have explored discrete-variable estimation. Here, we propose a method for high-precision identification of phase plate properties using a photon-based QSN, which is categorized as discrete-variable estimation. We consider an interaction of a single photon with $N$ phase plates. There are some distinct properties of the phase plates, and we aim to identify such properties. Specifically, we investigate two cases: (i) distinguishing between phase plates that impart uniformly random phases in the range $[0, 2\pi]$ and those that impart the same phase, and (ii) distinguishing between phase plates that impart uniformly random phases in $[0, 2\pi]$ and those that impart phases within a narrower range $[- \delta, \delta]$ ($0< \delta \ll 1$). For this distinction, we consider two approaches: one in which a single photon is prepared in a nonlocal state before interacting with the phase plates, and the other in which the single photon remains in a local state. Our results demonstrate that the nonlocal state enables more precise identification when $N$ is large.</p>

            <p>Quantum state estimation plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable creation of entanglement within quantum networks, yet conventional Quantum State Tomography (QST) methods remain resource-intensive and impractical for scaling. To address these limitations, we experimentally validate Distimation, a novel distillation-based protocol designed for efficient Bell-diagonal state estimation. Using IBM Quantum simulators and hardware, we demonstrate that Distimation accurately estimates Bell parameters under simulated and real-world noise conditions, but also demonstrating limitations with operational noise and number of available shots. Additionally, we simulate an asymmetric-fidelity Bell pair scenario via Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) to further validate Distimation under realistic network conditions. Our results establish Distimation as a viable method for scalable, real-time entanglement monitoring in practical quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dogyun Ko, Stanisław Świerczewski, Andrzej Opala, Michał Matuszewski, Amir Rahmani</p>
            <p>We propose a machine learning-based approach enhanced by quantum reservoir computing (QRC) to estimate the zero-time second-order correlation function g2(0). Typically, measuring g2(0) requires single-photon detectors and time-correlated measurements. Machine learning may offer practical solutions by training a model to estimate g2(0) solely from average intensity measurements. In our method, emission from a given quantum source is first processed in QRC. During the inference phase, only intensity measurements are used, which are then passed to a software-based decision tree-based ensemble model. We evaluate this hybrid quantum-classical approach across a variety of quantum optical systems and demonstrate that it provides accurate estimates of g2(0). We further extend our analysis to assess the ability of a trained model to generalize beyond its training distribution, both to the same system under different physical parameters and to fundamentally different quantum sources. While the model may yield reliable estimates within specific regimes, its performance across distinct systems is generally limited.</p>

            <p>Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum algorithm for approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems by reducing instances of linear satisfiability to bounded-distance decoding over superpositions of quantum states. A central challenge in realizing DQI is the design of a decoder that operates coherently on quantum superpositions. In this work, we present a concrete quantum circuit implementation of DQI, with a focus on the decoding subroutine. Our design leverages a reversible Gauss-Jordan elimination circuit for the decoding stage. We analyze the circuit's depth and gate complexity and validate its performance through simulations on systems with up to 30 qubits. These results establish a concrete foundation for scalable implementations of DQI and open the door to future algorithmic refinements and hardware-level realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. V. Baeva, A. S. Losev, I. V. Sokolov</p>
            <p>Squeezed Schrödinger cat states are a valuable resource for quantum error correction and quantum computing. In this paper, we investigate the gate for generating such states in the optical regime. Our scheme is based on the entanglement between an arbitrary (in general) signal and a resource non-Gaussian light fields on an asymmetric beamsplitter, followed by homodyne measurement. The resource field is preconditioned in the cubic phase state. In contrast to the previously considered gates that use the same resource state and QND entangling operation, the beamsplitter-based scheme offers a straightforward possibility for obtaining squeezed Schrödinger cat states with the desired degree of squeezing. Along with the exact description of the gate, we perform here the semiclassical analysis of the gate operation we have introduced previously. This allows us to demonstrate clearly the principle of gate operation and to reveal in a simple and visual form the significant statistical properties of the output state, such as the squeezing ratio and the specific deformations of the output cat state components. Comparative analysis of the gate efficiency is presented for different resource states, that is, the cubic phase state and the Fock state. The gate parameters that ensure the generation of squeezed Schrödinger cat states with a needed fidelity and probability are evaluated.</p>

Of primary concern is the development of the classical technology required to interface with quantum systems, as we push towards a new era of high-performance, large-scale quantum computing. In this review, we briefly discuss some of the main challenges facing the development of universally useful quantum computers and the different architectures being investigated. We are primarily concerned with cryogenic quantum systems. These systems are among the most mature quantum computing architectures to date, and are garnering a lot of both industrial and academic attention. We present and analyse the leading methods of interfacing with quantum processors, both now and for the next generation of larger, multi-qubit systems.

Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state.</p>

            <p>We revisit Hawking's black hole radiation derivation, including the quantum state of the initial matter forming the black hole. We investigate how non-vacuum initial quantum states, at the past of a black hole geometry, influence the black hole radiation observed at future null infinity $( \mathcal{I}^+)$. We further classify which of the initial state excitations are distinguishable from one another through measurements on the black hole radiation state. We use Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) to provide a clear physical interpretation of the results, in terms of localised operations. We then take a concrete example of a black hole made of one large collapsing excitation of mass $M$ and compare it to a same-mass black hole formed due to the collapse of two smaller excitations, of mass $M/2$ each. We find using our formalism that the two cases yield different radiation states and can in principle be distinguished. Our results provide a mechanism for partial information recovery in evaporating black holes, classify what information is recoverable through stimulated emission, and a concrete understanding of the classification based on the AQFT localisation.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</p>

Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. According to analyses based on moving mirror models, Hawking radiation originates from the Milne modes at past null infinity, that reflect off at the mirror and ultimately transform into real particle modes. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between ``real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation.</p>

            <p>The Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function, commonly used for approximating molecular ground states, becomes nonideal in open shell systems due to the inherent multi-configurational nature of the wave function, limiting accuracy in Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE). We propose replacing the HF wave function with a spin- and spatial-symmetry broken wave function, enhancing convergence by adding a spin operator, $S^2$ as a penalty term to the original molecular Hamiltonian. We verify that this approach provides good convergence behavior towards the lowest energy eigenstate using direct matrix exponentiation for Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Numerical simulations were performed on the hydrogen molecule and a square tetrahydrogen cluster using measurement-assisted unitary approximation in QITE. QITE demonstrates faster convergence to the ground state with broken symmetry (BS) compared to HF, particularly after the molecule exhibits a diradical character of 0.56 for hydrogen. Prior to this point, HF remains more effective, suggesting a transition threshold of diradical character for wave function selection. Additionally, the overlap analysis with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CAS-CI) wave function shows that BS has a larger initial overlap than HF in higher-spin, multi-configurational systems like triple bond dissociation in nitrogen molecule. This method provides a pathway for improved energy simulations in open shell systems, where wave function accuracy significantly impacts downstream quantum algorithms and practical applications in quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida</p>
            <p>The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement in Monitored Random Clifford Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanglei Xu, Yu-Xiang Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ($\text{GHZ}_n$) entanglement in monitored random Clifford circuits and uncover a series of novel phase transitions and dynamical features. Random Clifford circuits are well-known for a measurement-induced transition between phases of volume-law and area-law (bipartite) entanglement. We numerically find that the volume-law phase is characterized by, approximately, a constant amount of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement, despite the variations of system size and the rate of measurement. The area-law phase does not harbor such tripartite entanglement. A measurement-induced phase transition is also seen from $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement. Moreover, the amount of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement generally does not change with the partitioning of the system, but abruptly drops to zero when a subsystem has more than half of the qubits, giving rise to a partitioning-induced phase transition. Dynamically, $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement does not grow gradually, as is typical for bipartite entanglement, but instead emerges suddenly through dynamical phase transitions (DPTs). Furthermore, in some situations we observe transient $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement that will suddenly disappear through another DPT. We also studied multipartite $\text{GHZ}_{n\geq 4}$ entanglement and find they emerge exclusively at the measurement-induced criticality, providing new insights into the long-range correlations of critical states.</p>

            <p>Building on the insight that engineered noise, specifically, engineered dephasing can enhance the adiabaticity of controlled quantum dynamics, we investigate how a dephasing-generating coupling to an auxiliary quantum system affects quantum annealing protocols. By calculating the exact reduced system dynamics, we show how this coupling enhances the system's adiabaticity solely through a coherent mechanism - an effective energy rescaling. We show that it can lead to an annealing speedup linearly proportional to the strength of the coupling. We discuss the experimental feasibility of the protocols, and investigate the trade-off between fidelity and implementability by examining two modified versions with fewer types of required physical couplings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Ye, Yan-Zhi Wang, Xiang-You Chen, Qing-Hu Chen, Hai-Qing Lin</p>
            <p>Although the superradiant phase transition (SRPT) is prohibited in the paradigmatic quantum Rabi model due to the no-go theorem caused by the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term, we demonstrate two distinct types of SRPTs emerging from the normal phase in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model. A discontinuous phase transition between the two types of superradiant phases also emerges in the presence of a strong $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. Additionally, a rich phase diagram featuring a triple point, which connects first- and second-order phase transitions, is derived analytically and confirmed through numerical diagonalization at large effective system sizes. Finally, distinct critical behavior at the triple point is revealed and contrasted with that of a single continuous SRPT. This work may open a new avenue for observing SRPTs in their intrinsic form without altering the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term, while also offering a practical platform for exploring rich quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we study the recurrence of homogeneous Open Quantum Walks (HOQWs) induced by finite-dimensional coins $(L,B,R)$. We present three distinct recurrence criteria, each adapted to different types of coins. The first criterion applies to coins whose auxiliary map has a unique invariant state, resulting in the first recurrence criterion for Lazy HOQWs. The second one applies to Lazy HOQWs of dimension 2, where we provide a complete characterization of the recurrence for this low-dimensional case. Finally, we present a general criterion for finite-dimensional coins in the non-lazy case $(B=0)$, which generalizes many of the previously known results. This new criterion holds for irreducible and reducible HOQWs.</p>

            <p>Symmetric private information retrieval is a cryptographic task allowing a user to query a database and obtain exactly one entry without revealing to the owner of the database which element was accessed. The task is a variant of general two-party protocols called one-sided secure function evaluation and is closely related to oblivious transfer. Under the name quantum private queries, quantum protocols have been proposed to solve this problem in a cheat-sensitive way: In such protocols, it is not impossible for dishonest participants to cheat, but they risk detection [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230502 (2008)]. We give an explicit attack against any cheat-sensitive symmetric private information retrieval protocol, showing that any protocol that is secure for the user cannot have non-trivial security guarantees for the owner of the database.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling quantum phase estimation: exploring the impact of multi-photon interference on the quantum Fisher information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Annameng Ma, Agustina G. Magnoni, Miguel A. Larotonda, Laura T. Knoll</p>
            <p>Quantum interference is known to become extinct with distinguishing information, as illustrated by the ubiquitous double-slit experiment or the two-photon HOM effect. In the former case single particle interference is destroyed with which-path information while in the latter bunching interference tails-off as photons become distinguishable. It has been observed that when more than two particles are involved, these interference patterns are in general a non monotonic function of the distinguishability. Here we perform a comprehensive characterization, both theoretically and experimentally, of four-photon interference by analyzing the corresponding correlation functions, contemplating several degrees of distinguishability across different parameters. This study provides all the necessary tools to quantify the impact of multi-photon interference on precision measurements of parameters such as phase, frequency, and time difference. We apply these insights to quantify the precision in the estimation of an interferometric phase in a two-port interferometer using a four-photon state. Our results reveal that, for certain phase values, partially distinguishable multi-photon states can achieve higher Fisher information values compared to the two-photon experiment. These findings highlight the potential of distinguishable multi-photon states for enhanced precision in quantum metrology and related applications.</p>

            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Application of an upsampling algorithm to quantum state preparation of continuous and discrete probability distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. P. Erickson</p>
            <p>Upsampling of time series data is often associated with classical fast Fourier transform analysis, but it also can be employed in the preparation of a quantum state vector. The quantum circuit of preparation derived from functional data sampled in this way exhibits exponential gate depth, like other divide-and-conquer algorithms, but is transformable to an equivalent circuit of polylogarithmic gate depth. In this study, we derive a polylogarthmic upsampling algorithm for construction of a state vector with amplitudes that are square roots of probabilities sampled from a continuous probability distribution having support over the entire real line. As examples, we prepare state vectors associated with Gaussian and Laplace distributions; state vectors for other continuous probability distributions such as Cauchy and Student's t follow in a similar manner. We also extend the algorithm to include preparation of a state vector whose amplitudes are square roots of an arbitrary distribution of discrete probabilities. Our analyses focus on univariate distributions, but can be extended to multivariate forms. The polylogarithmic upsampling algorithm has financial and scientific application.</p>

We examine the spherical mirror geometry as a case study of this backaction suppression effect, discussing the theoretical and experimental constraints. We study the effects of laser recoil directly, by analysing optical force fluctuations acting on a dipolar particle trapped at the centre of a spherical mirror. We also compute the corresponding measurement imprecision in an interferometric, shot-noise-limited position measurement, using the formalism of Fisher information flow. Our results show that the standing-wave trapping field is necessary for backaction suppression in three dimensions, and they satisfy the Heisenberg limit of detection.</p>

            <h2>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur</p>
            <p>We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids. This is equivalent to add charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. This reveals from an equilibrium approach the entangled nature of the two counter-propagating fractional charges associated to the same electron in the system. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach also clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ring geometry at zero temperature from a space-time correspondence in 1D. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group. Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, also we show how bipartite fluctuations can detect the presence of a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</p>

The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown, and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research, and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.</p>

            <h2>Broadband Kinetic-Inductance Parametric Amplifiers with Impedance Engineering</h2>

            <p>Broadband quantum-limited parametric amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in quantum information science and technology. Impedance-engineered resonator-based PAs and traveling-wave PAs are the primary approaches to overcome the gain-bandwidth constraint. While the former PAs are simpler to fabricate, the target characteristic impedance Z_\text{NR} of the nonlinear resonator has been restricted to be below 10 \Omega, requiring large capacitance. Moreover, these PAs have only been implemented with aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs), hindering their operation at high temperatures or strong magnetic fields. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage impedance-transformer scheme, showcased with a 20-nm-thick, 250-nm-wide high-kinetic-inductance niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN) film. Our scheme enables Z_\text{NR} up to several tens of ohms--a tenfold improvement over conventional designs, achieved through an additional quarter-wavelength transmission line with the characteristic impedance of 180 \Omega. Our kinetic-inductance impedance-engineered parametric amplifiers (KIMPA), featuring a 330-fF shunt capacitor, demonstrate a phase-preserving amplification with a 450-MHz bandwidth at 17-dB gain, and an added noise ranging from 0.5-1.3 quanta near the center frequency of 8.4 GHz. Due to the high critical current of the NbTiN nanowire, the KIMPA also achieves a saturation power of up to -68\pm3 dBm, approximately 30-dB higher than that of JJ-based PAs. This scheme also opens new possibilities for other three-wave-mixing building blocks.</p>

We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using two-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency compared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The change detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative entropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise, suggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore the fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection latency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.</p>

            <p>The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied quantum measurement procedures. Usually, such process involves the coupling of a single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that the relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by observing the probe system. Here, we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings among the signal and probe modes with ancillary modes prepared off-line in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed by homodyne detections and feedforward modulations. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for post-modulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.</p>

            <h2>Magic state distillation without measurements and post-selection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sascha Heußen</p>
            <p>Magic state distillation (MSD) is a quantum algorithm that enables performing logical non-Clifford gates with in principle arbitrarily low noise level. It is herein typically assumed that logical Clifford gates can be executed without noise. Therefore, MSD is a standard subroutine to obtain a fault-tolerant universal set of quantum gate operations on error-corrected logical qubits. Well-known schemes conventionally rely on performing operator measurements and post-selection on the measurement result, which makes distillation protocols non-deterministic in the presence of noise. In this work, we adapt the 15-to-1 MSD protocol such that it deterministically suppresses noise by using a coherent feedback network on the output states without the need to perform individual qubit measurements. These advantages over textbook MSD come at the price of reducing the noise suppression per round from $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$. Our technique can be applied to any MSD protocol with an acceptance rate of 1 in the absence of noise. It may be desirable to use our scheme if the coherent feedback network can be executed faster and more reliably than the measurements and/or if logical clock cycles in the quantum processor should be kept synchronous at all times. Our result broadens the path of potential experimental realizations of MSD in near-term devices and advances the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with practical use.</p>

            <p>Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.</p>

            <p>Counterdiabatic driving emerges as a valuable technique for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, enhancing quantum technology applications. In this context, counterdiabatic quantum computing represents a new paradigm with the potential to achieve quantum advantage for industrial problems. This work investigates the production of quantum coherence in adiabatic evolution accelerated by counterdiabatic driving within the framework of counterdiabatic quantum computing. Specifically, we analyze different orders in the nested commutator expansion for approximated counterdiabatic drivings for three cases: a weighted max-cut problem, a 4-local Hamiltonian, and a non-stoquastic Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that the hierarchy introduced by coherence production correlates with the success probability in the impulse regime. This suggests that protocols increasing coherence during evolution enhance performance in adiabatic evolution driven by counterdiabatic techniques. We show that large quantum coherence also means large energy fluctuation during evolution, which is associated with the speed of evolution, paving the way for designing superior algorithms in counterdiabatic quantum computing.</p>

By incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find non-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model allows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the cavity deviating from $90^\circ$.

            <p>When light and matter interact strongly, the resulting hybrid system inherits properties from both constituents, allowing one to modify material behavior by engineering the surrounding electromagnetic environment. This concept underlies the emerging paradigm of cavity materials engineering, which aims at the control of material properties via tailored vacuum fluctuations of dark photonic environments. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging due to the combined complexity of extended electronic states and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here, we derive an effective, non-perturbative theory for low-dimensional crystals embedded in a Fabry-Pérot resonator, within the long-wavelength limit. Our approach incorporates the multimode and dispersive nature of the cavity field and reduces it to an effective single-mode description by imposing the condition of negligible momentum transfer from light to matter. Importantly, the resulting effective mode is characterized by a finite mode volume-even in the limit of extended cavities-which is directly linked to realistic cavity parameters. This ensures that the light-matter coupling remains finite in bulk systems. By explicitly accounting for the finite reflectivity of cavity mirrors, our theory also avoids double counting the contribution from free-space light-matter coupling. Overall, our results provide a robust and realistic framework for describing cavity-matter interactions at the Hamiltonian level, incorporating the electromagnetic environment beyond the idealized perfect-mirror approximation.</p>

These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.</p>

            <h2>Quantum coherence and the invisible Universe: Subradiance as a dark matter mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Houde, Fereshteh Rajabi</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aman Ullah, Ziqi Hu, Juan Aragó, Alejandro Gaita-Ariño</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical framework to investigate spin chirality in molecular quantum systems. Focusing on a minimal three-spin-center model with antiferromagnetic exchange and symmetry breaking driven by an electric-field-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and applied magnetic fields-give rise to chiral ground states characterized by nonzero scalar spin chirality, $\chi = \textbf{S}_1\cdot(\textbf{S}_r\times \textbf{S}_2)$. The emergent chiral qubits naturally suppress always-on interactions that can not be switched off in weakly coupled qubits, as demonstrated through Liouville-von Neumann dynamics, which reveal phase difference in superposition states that form chiral qubits. To validate this framework, we examine realistic lanthanide complexes with radical-bridged magnetic centers, where spin-orbit coupling and asymmetric exchange facilitate chirality. Our findings establish spin chirality engineering as a promising strategy for mitigating always-on interaction in entangling two chiral qubits in molecular quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>In this article, we solve the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation in the presence of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier and well for spin-one particles. We derive the scattering solution in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1(a, b; c; z)$, the regularized Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2\tilde{F}_1(a, b; c; z)$, and the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$. Our analysis reveals the presence of transmission resonances. To observe these resonances, we calculate and plot the transmission $T$ and reflection $R$ coefficients for various parameters of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Our results are compared with those obtained for the square potential barrier and the cusp potential barrier, which represent limiting cases of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Furthermore, we investigate the bound state solutions, determining the critical turning point $V_{cr}$ to study particle-antiparticle creation and compute the norm $N$. Finally, we also compare our results with those obtained for the square potential well and the cusp potential well, confirming that pair creation occurs in both potential wells.</p>

            <h2>Robust Mixed-State Cluster States and Spurious Topological Entanglement Negativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seunghun Lee, Eun-Gook Moon</p>
            <p>We investigate 1D and 2D cluster states under local decoherence to assess the robustness of their mixed-state subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) order. By exactly computing fidelity correlators via dimensional reduction of effective statistical mechanics models, we pinpoint the critical error rate for strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of strong subsystem symmetry. Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity. This also highlights that topological entanglement negativity, a widely used diagnostic for mixed-state topological order, is generally not invariant under finite-depth quantum channels.</p>

            <p>The density matrix yields probabilistic information about the outcome of measurements on a quantum system, but it does not distinguish between classical randomness in the preparation of the system and entanglement with its environment. Here, we show that retrodiction, employing both prior and posterior knowledge, gives rise to conditional probabilities for measurements on a single system, that can witness if it is part of a larger composite system. The degree of certainty with which one can retrodict the outcomes of multiple measurements on a system can witness both the existence and the quantitative nature of its entanglement with the environment.</p>

            <h2>Injection locking of Rydberg dissipative time crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darmindra Arumugam</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium Rydberg gases exhibit exotic many-body phases stabilized by the interplay of coherent interactions and dissipation. Strong Rydberg interactions drive sustained limit cycle oscillations, whose robustness, long-range temporal order, and spontaneous time-translation symmetry breaking establish a dissipative time crystal (DTC). Collective self-entrainment in driven ensembles leads to global synchronization and a dominant oscillation frequency. Here, injection locking of a Rydberg DTC is demonstrated using a radio-frequency (RF) electric field that gradually pulls the intrinsic oscillation toward the injected frequency. Above a critical threshold, full synchronization occurs, with the locking bandwidth scaling linearly with RF amplitude. This includes synchronization of higher-order harmonics, revealing entrainment of the system nonlinear temporal dynamics. The phenomenon parallels injection locking in classical nonlinear systems, but emerges here in a strongly interacting quantum medium. This approach establishes a new method for stabilizing and controlling quantum temporal order, with applications in precision sensing, quantum metrology, and timekeeping.</p>

            <p>We investigate theoretically the improvement of the entanglement between the indirectly coupled two magnon modes in a magnomechanical system with magnon squeezing. We quantify the degree of entanglement via logarithmic negativity between two magnon modes. We show a significant enhancement of entanglement via magnon squeezing. Additionally, the entanglement of two magnons decreases monotonically under thermal effects. We demonstrate that with an increasing photon tunneling rate, entanglement is robust and resistant to thermal effects. We use purity as a witness to the mixing between the two magnon modes. We show that synchronization and purity are very robust against thermal effects rather than entanglement. We examine the relationship between quantum entanglement, purity, and quantum synchronization in both steady and dynamic states. According to our results, this scheme could be a promising platform for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Kronecker states: a powerful source of multipartite maximally entangled states in quantum information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walther Gonzalez</p>
            <p>In quantum information theory, maximally entangled states, specifically locally maximally entangled (LME) states, are essential for quantum protocols. While many focus on bipartite entanglement, applications such as quantum error correction and multiparty secret sharing rely on multipartite entanglement. These LME states naturally appear in the invariant subspaces of tensor products of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$, called Kronecker subspaces, whose dimensions are the Kronecker coefficients. A Kronecker subspace is a space of multipartite LME states that entangle high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Although these states can be derived from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $S_n$, known methods are inefficient even for small $n$. A quantum-information-based alternative comes from entanglement concentration protocols, where Kronecker subspaces arise in the isotypic decomposition of multiple copies of entangled states. Closed forms have been found for the multiqubit $W$-class states, but not in general. This thesis extends that approach to any multiqubit system. We first propose a graphical construction called W-state Stitching, where multiqubit entangled states are represented as tensor networks built from $W$ states. By analyzing the isotypic decomposition of copies of these graph states, corresponding graph Kronecker states can be constructed. In particular, graph states of generic multiqubit systems can generate any Kronecker subspace. We explicitly construct bases for three- and four-qubit systems and show that the W-stitching technique also serves as a valuable tool for multiqubit entanglement classification. These results may open new directions in multipartite entanglement resource theories, with bipartite and tripartite $W$ states as foundational elements, and asymptotic analysis based on Kronecker states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alissa Wilms, Laura Ohff, Andrea Skolik, Jens Eisert, Sumeet Khatri, David A. Reiss</p>
            <p>Rare events are essential for understanding the behavior of non-equilibrium and industrial systems. It is of ongoing interest to develop methods for effectively searching for rare events. With the advent of quantum computing and its potential advantages over classical computing for applications like sampling certain probability distributions, the question arises whether quantum computers could also provide an advantage or inspire new methods for sampling the statistics of rare events. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method for studying rare dynamics, and we investigate their benefits over classical approaches based on neural networks. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrate that our QRL agents can learn and generate the rare dynamics of random walks, and we are able to explain this success as well as the different contributing factors to it via the intrinsic Fourier features of the parameterized quantum circuit. Furthermore, we show better learning behavior with fewer parameters compared to classical approaches. This is the first investigation of QRL applied to generating rare events and suggests that QRL is a promising method to study their dynamics and statistics.</p>

            <p>We generalize the quantum CUSUM (QUSUM) algorithm for quickest change-point detection, analyzed in finite dimensions by Fanizza, Hirche, and Calsamiglia (Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 020602, 2023), to infinite-dimensional quantum systems. Our analysis relies on a novel generalization of a result by Hayashi (Hayashi, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34, 3413, 2001) concerning the asymptotics of quantum relative entropy, which we establish for the infinite-dimensional setting. This enables us to prove that the QUSUM strategy retains its asymptotic optimality, characterized by the relationship between the expected detection delay and the average false alarm time for any pair of states with finite relative entropy. Consequently, our findings apply broadly, including continuous-variable systems (e.g., Gaussian states), facilitating the development of optimal change-point detection schemes in quantum optics and other physical platforms, and rendering experimental verification feasible.</p>

We prove theoretically that this technique reaches the ultimate sensitivity in the 3D relative localization of two emitters, already with a number of sampling measurements of 1000 and a bias in the three localization parameters below 1%. These results are independent of the values of the localization parameters to estimate.</p>

            <p>Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a critical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially-separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We further transfer the W state from the memory qubits to the photonic qubits, and confirm the genuine four-partite entanglement through witness measurements. We then demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way towards realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.</p>

            <h2>Achieving the positivity of the secret key in a BB84 like quantum key distribution protocol</h2>

            <p>Woodhead [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{88}, 012331 (2013)] derived the lower bound of the secret key rate for a Bennett-Brassard (BB84) like quantum key distribution protocol under collective attacks. However, this lower bound does not always assure the generation of the secret key and thus the protocol may have to be aborted sometimes. Thus, we modify the Woodhead's lower bound of the secret key rate in such a way that the secret key is always generated in a BB84 like quantum key distribution protocol. Exploiting the obtained modified lower bound of the secret key rate, we analyze two state dependent quantum cloning machines such as (i) Wootters-Zurek QCM and (ii) Modified Buzek-Hillery QCM constructed by fixing the cloning machine parameters of Buzek Hillery quantum cloning machine (QCM), which may be used by the eavesdropper to extract information from the intercepted state. We, thereafter, show that it is possible for the communicating parties to distill a secret key, even in the presence of an eavesdropper. Moreover, we also discuss the effect of the efficiency of the QCM on the generation of the secret key for a successful key distribution protocol.</p>

            <p>Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), enhances quantum cryptography by mitigating detector-side vulnerabilities. This study analyzes MDI-QKD performance in thermal-loss and phase noise channels, modeled as depolarizing and dephasing channels to capture thermal and phase noise effects. Based on this channel framework, we derive analytical expressions for Bell state measurement probabilities, quantum bit error rates (QBER), and secret key rates (SKR) of MDI-QKD. Our simulations reveal that SKR decreases exponentially with transmission distance, with performance further degraded by increasing thermal noise and phase noise, particularly under high thermal noise conditions. These findings offer insights into enhancing MDI-QKD's noise resilience, supporting secure key generation in practical, noisy environments.</p>

            <p>Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for practical quantum computing, as it protects fragile quantum information from errors by encoding it in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Conventional QEC protocols typically require repeated syndrome measurements, real-time feedback, and the use of multiple physical qubits for encoding. Such implementations pose significant technical complexities, particularly for trapped-ion systems, with high demands on precision and scalability. Here, we realize autonomous QEC with a logical qubit encoded in multiple internal spin states of a single trapped ion, surpassing the break-even point for qubit lifetime. Our approach leverages engineered spin-motion couplings to transfer error-induced entropy into motional modes, which are subsequently dissipated through sympathetic cooling with an ancilla ion, fully eliminating the need for measurement and feedback. By repetitively applying this autonomous QEC protocol under injected low-frequency noise, we extend the logical qubit lifetime to approximately 11.6 ms, substantially outperforming lifetime for both the physical qubit ($\simeq$0.9 ms) and the uncorrected logical qubit ($\simeq$0.8 ms), thereby beating the break-even point with autonomous protection of quantum information without measurement or post-selection. This work presents an efficient approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing that harnesses the intrinsic multi-level structure of trapped ions, providing a distinctive path toward scalable architectures and robust quantum memories with reduced overhead.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) plays a critical role in preventing information loss in quantum systems and provides a framework for reliable quantum computation. Identifying quantum codes with nice code parameters for physically motivated noise models remains an interesting challenge. While past work has primarily focused on qubit codes, here we identify a $[4,1]$ qudit error correcting code tailored to protect against amplitude-damping noise. We show that this four-qudit code satisfies the error correction conditions for all single-qudit and a few two-qudit damping errors up to the leading order in the damping parameter $\gamma$. We devise a protocol to extract syndromes that unambiguously identify this set of errors, leading to a noise-adapted recovery scheme that achieves a fidelity loss of $\mathcal{O}(\gamma^{2})$. For the $d=2$ case, our QEC scheme is identical to the known example of the $4$-qubit code and the associated syndrome-based recovery. We also assess the performance of this code using the Petz recovery map and note some interesting deviations from the qubit case. Finally, we generalize this construction to a family of $[2M+2, M]$ qudit codes that can approximately correct all the single-qudit and a few two-qudit amplitude-damping errors.</p>

Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</p>

For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced Förster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</p>

These cases are experimentally accessible in superconducting circuits, where the Floquet quasienergy spectrum can also be studied as a function of tunable control parameters. Using the classical Hamiltonian of the system, we identify the critical points associated with quantum phase transitions and analyze the emergence of both real and avoided level crossings, examining their influence on the energy spectrum and tunneling dynamics. Our findings provide insights into the engineering of robust quantum states, quantum dynamics control, and onset of quantum phase transitions with implications for critical quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile platform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme extends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting quantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as single-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware efficiency.</p>

This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</p>

            <h2>Full dynamics of two-membrane cavity optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenlin Li, Xingli Li, Yan Li, Francesco Marzioni, Paolo Piergentili, Francesco Rasponi, David Vitali</p>
            <p>In a two-membrane cavity optomechanical setup, two semi-transparent membranes placed within an optical Fabry-Pérot cavity yield a nontrivial dependence of the frequency of a mode of the optical cavity on the membranes' positions, which is due to interference. However, the system dynamics is typically described by a radiation pressure force treatment in which the frequency shift is expanded stopping at first order in the membrane displacements. In this paper, we study the full dynamics of the system obtained by considering the exact nonlinear dependence of the optomechanical interaction between two membranes' vibrational modes and the driven cavity mode. We then compare this dynamics with the standard treatment based on the Hamiltonian linear interaction, and we find the conditions under which the two dynamics may significantly depart from each other. In particular, we see that a parameter regime exists in which the customary first-order treatment provides distinct and incorrect predictions for the synchronization of two self-sustained mechanical limit-cycles, and for Gaussian entanglement of the two membranes in the case of two-tone driving.</p>

            <p>In superconducting qubits, suppression of spontaneous emission is essential to achieve fast dispersive measurement and reset without sacrificing qubit lifetime. We show that resonator-mediated decay of the qubit mode to the feedline can be suppressed using destructive interference, where the readout resonator is coupled to the feedline at two points. This "interferometric Purcell filter" does not require dedicated filter components or impedance mismatch in the feedline, making it suitable for applications such as all-pass readout. We design and fabricate a device with the proposed scheme and demonstrate suppression of resonator-mediated decay that exceeds 2 orders of magnitude over a bandwidth of 400 MHz for a resonator linewidth of 13.8 MHz.</p>

            <h2>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in cavity QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muzamil Shah, Shahid Qamar, Muhammad Waseem</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the manipulation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance, the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits PSHE similar to the CTL system, showing enhanced PSHE due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence PSHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence PSHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning PSHE. The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED. The demonstrated tunability via probe field detuning, control fields, and atomic density paves the way for advanced optical control and enhanced precision in cavity QED devices.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <h2>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yevhenii Morozov, Anatoliy Lapchuk</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity: A perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anneswa Paul, Upendra Harbola</p>
            <p>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity and formation of polaritonic states have gained interest in the past decades as it has direct applications in many research fields. Different regimes of light-matter coupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is rotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling and near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \leq \lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \leq\lambda/\omega_c\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\lambda/\omega_c\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting has been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic states. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon coupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is not captured by RWA. In fact, RWA breaks down completely to predict the ground state properties as it fails to capture the interaction between the matter and the cavity field.</p>

            <p>Photonic quantum computing offers a promising platform for quantum information processing, benefiting from the long coherence times of photons and their ease of manipulation. This paper presents a scheme for implementing a deterministic phase gate for dual-rail number encoded photonic qubits, leveraging a standard 1D waveguide coupled to an array of two-level emitters (TLE). Using a transfer matrix approach, we develop a protocol for deterministic phase gate operation, demonstrating its robustness against non-waveguide mode coupling and disorder. Finally, we relax the idealized assumption of monochromatic light, considering finite-bandwidth pulses. Despite these realistic considerations, our results indicate high fidelity for the proposed phase gate protocol. Finally we will discuss two qubit operations.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme to generate and manipulate nonreciprocal photon blockade effect in an asymmetrical Fabry-Pérot cavity, which consists of a single two-level atom and a second-order nonlinear medium. By utilizing the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of cavity and applying a parametric amplification pumping laser to the nonlinear medium, we can realize direction-dependent single-photon and two-photon blockade effects. For nonreciprocal single-photon blockade, our proposal is robust across a wide range of parameters, such as the cavity or atomic detuning, coupling strength, and atomic decay. Within similar parameter ranges, nonreciprocal two-photon blockade can be achieved and modulated by finely adjusting the parametric amplification pumping. Our project offers a feasible access to generating high-quality and tunable nonreciprocal single/two-photon source and paves a new avenue for investigating the nonreciprocity of photon quantum statistical properties.</p>

            <p>Radiation-pressure interactions between harmonic oscillators have enabled exquisite measurement precision and control, made possible by using strong sideband drives, enhancing the coupling rate while also linearizing the interaction. In this letter, we demonstrate a strong intrinsic longitudinal coupling, a circuit quantum electrodynamics analogue of the radiation-pressure interaction, between a transmon qubit and a linear microwave resonator. A red-detuned sideband drive results in an on-demand Jaynes-Cummings interaction with a high on-off ratio. We measure a longitudinal coupling rate an order of magnitude larger than all decay rates, placing the device in the strong coupling regime. The intrinsic longitudinal interaction demonstrated here will enable the development of high-connectivity quantum information processing hardware and the exploration of the gravitational decoherence of quantum objects.</p>

In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are among the most promising solid-state qubit candidates, owing to their exceptionally long spin coherence times, efficient spin-photon coupling, room-temperature operation, and steadily advancing fabrication and integration techniques. Despite significant progress in the field, atomic-scale characterization and control of individual NV centers have remained elusive. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing a conductive graphene capping layer to enable direct imaging and manipulation of $NV^{-}$ defects via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By investigating over 40 individual $NV^{-}$ centers, we identify their spectroscopic signatures and spatial configurations. Our dI/dV conductance spectra reveal the ground state approximately 300 meV below the Fermi level. Additionally, density-of-states mapping uncovers a two-lobed wavefunction aligned along the [111] crystallographic direction. Remarkably, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate the charge state of the NV centers from $NV^{-}$ to $NV^{0}$ through STM tip-induced gating. This work represents a significant advancement in the atomic-scale understanding and engineering of NV centers, paving the way for future quantum device development.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Stammer, Javier Rivera-Dean, Maciej Lewenstein</p>
            <p>Optical coherence encodes information about the correlations of the electromagnetic field. In combination with quantum optical approaches, it allows for the study of the correlations between photons. Since the pioneering papers of Glauber, studies of optical coherence have facilitated many fundamental insights into non-classical signatures of light emission processes, with wide applicability in modern quantum technologies. However, when it comes to the photon up-conversion process of high-order harmonic generation the description has focused on semi-classical methods for decades. In this work, we overcome this limitation and establish a quantum optical theory of field correlations for the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). In effect, we introduce the notion of optical coherence at the intersection of quantum optics and strong laser-driven processes, and obtain the harmonic field correlation functions. In particular, we focus on the first and second order field correlation, which allow to understand the origin of the classical properties of the HHG spectrum, and its departure into the quantum regime. Further, we develop the theory for two-time intensity correlation functions of the harmonic field, and demonstrate the onset of anti-bunching signatures in HHG. We study the correlation functions in the regime of a single, few and many emitters in atomic HHG, showing the transition from quantum to classical signatures in the correlations. Since the theory is generic, it can be extended to multi-time correlation functions of any order, and allows to consider the interaction of light with arbitrary material systems.</p>

            <p>The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities.</p>

            <p>Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when some loss mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.</p>

We examine the time evolution of the concurrence of the eigenstates of the symmetric logarithmic derivative and show that, for both initially separable and initially entangled states, simple product measurements suffice to saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound when CoE = -QFI, while otherwise, in general, entangled measurements are required giving an operational significance to the points in time when CoE = -QFI.</p>

While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moiré excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states without requiring subwavelength spatial resolution. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moiré excitons.</p>

Here, we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical switching of heralded photon-number states using the optical Kerr effect in a single-mode fiber. A local birefringence is created by a high-intensity pump pulse at a center wavelength of 1030nm that temporally overlaps with the 1550nm photon-number states in the fiber. By taking advantage of the dispersion profile of commercially available single-mode fibers, we achieve all-optical switching of photon-number states, with up to 6 photons, with a switching resolution of 2.3ps.

This practically inevitable scenario leads to a tripartite quantum system of matter, and light -- detected and lost.

We succeed by expressing the final quantum state of the detected light as a matrix product operator. We apply our method to resonance fluorescence and pulsed spectroscopy. For both, we quantify the sub-optimality of continuous homodyning and photo-counting measurements in parameter estimation. For the latter, we find that single-photon Fock state pulses allow higher precision per photon than pulses of coherent states. Our method should be valuable in studies of quantum light-matter interactions, quantum light spectroscopy, quantum stochastic thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.</p>

            <h2>Spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric sphere in the modified Langevin noise formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Miano, Loris Maria Cangemi, Carlo Forestiere</p>
            <p>This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter can be described by means of two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each described by its own spectral density. Therefore, for initial thermal states of the reservoirs having different temperatures, the common approach based on the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object cannot be employed. We study the interaction of a quantum emitter with these two reservoirs introducing a temperature-dependent effective spectral density of the electromagnetic environment, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.</p>

            <h2>Multi-qubit nanoscale sensing with entanglement as a resource</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Rovny, Shimon Kolkowitz, Nathalie P. de Leon</p>
            <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using coherent, single qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators, or using entangled states to improve measurement sensitivity. Here, we describe protocols to use optically unresolved NV center pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise, enabling covariance magnetometry at nanometer length scales. For NV centers that are optically unresolved but have spectrally resolved spin transitions, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations by alternating the relative spin orientations of the two NV centers. For NV centers that are both optically and spectrally unresolved, we leverage the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus that is strongly coupled to one of the NV centers, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable a similar phase-cycling protocol. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole-dipole coupling between two NV centers, and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centers. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV center spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in a dramatic sensitivity improvement. Finally, we demonstrate methods for the detection of high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centers.</p>

            <h2>Excitation transfer and many-body dark states in WQED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Chen, Guin-Dar Lin, Hiang-Hua Jen</p>
            <p>In one-dimensional waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, quantum emitters interact through infinite-range, dispersive, and dissipative dipole-dipole interactions mediated by guided photonic modes. These interactions give rise to long-range periodic behavior and rich many-body physics absent in free space. In this work, we construct a set of symmetrized M-excitation dark states and derive analytic expressions for their time-evolution projections. This framework captures the essential dynamics of excitation transport and storage while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to full quantum simulations. Our analysis reveals a fundamental bound on energy redistribution governed by the structure of dark states and collective dissipation, and discovers that optimal excitation transfer between emitter ensembles converges toward an initial pumped fraction of $N_\text{p}/N \approx 0.55$ for large system sizes. We further examine the robustness of this mechanism under realistic imperfections, including positional disorder, nonradiative decay, and dephasing. These results highlight the role of many-body dark states in enabling efficient and controllable energy transfer, offering new insights into dissipative many-body dynamics in integrated quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>We introduce the concept of giant superatoms (GSAs), where two or more interacting atoms are nonlocally coupled to a waveguide through one of them, and explore their unconventional quantum dynamics. For braided GSAs, this setup enables decoherence-free transfer and swapping of their internal entangled states. For separate GSAs, engineering coupling phases leads to state-dependent chiral emission, which enables selective, directional quantum information transfer. This mechanism further facilitates remote generation of W-class entangled states. Our results thereby open exciting possibilities for quantum networks and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Observation of quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan-Wilke Henke, Hao Jeng, Murat Sivis, Claus Ropers</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is central to both the foundations of quantum mechanics and the development of new technologies in information processing, communication, and sensing. Entanglement has been realised in a variety of physical systems, spanning atoms, ions, photons, collective excitations, and hybrid combinations of particles. Remarkably, however, photons and free electrons -- the quanta of light and their most elementary sources -- have never been observed in an entangled state. Here, we demonstrate quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons. We show that entanglement is produced when an electron, prepared in a superposition of two beams, passes a nanostructure and generates transition radiation in a polarisation state tied to the electron path. By implementing quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the full density matrix of the electron-photon pair, and show that the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is violated by more than 7 standard deviations. Based on this foundational element of emerging free-electron quantum optics, we anticipate manifold developments in enhanced electron imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. More broadly, the ability to generate and measure entanglement opens electron microscopy to previously inaccessible quantum observables and correlations in solids and nanostructures.</p>

            <p>Entanglement, a key resource of emerging quantum technologies, describes correlations between particles that defy classical physics. It has been studied extensively on various platforms, but has remained elusive in electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopes are well-established tools for materials characterisation with unparalleled spatial resolution. They provide control over the preparation and detection of high energy electrons, with largely unexploited potential in the study of many-body quantum correlations. Here, we demonstrate entanglement in electron-photon pairs generated via cathodoluminescence in a transmission electron microscope. Employing coincidence imaging techniques adapted from photonic quantum optics, we reconstruct both near- and far-field ``ghost'' images of periodic transmission masks. By measuring spatial and momentum correlations, we show a violation of the classical uncertainty bound: $\Delta x_-^2 \Delta k_+^2 = 0.502 \pm 0.047<1$. Hence, we demonstrate entanglement in position and momentum -- the continuous variables at the base of most imaging methods, bridging the fields of electron microscopy and quantum optics. Our work paves the way for exploring quantum correlations in free-electron systems and their application to quantum-enhanced imaging techniques on the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5 \times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$ $^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.</p>

            <h2>A novel quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ji-Chong Yang, Shuai Zhang, Chong-Xing Yue</p>
            <p>Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small. Consequently, future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as precision tests advance, rare processes with many final-state particles require consideration which demand the analysis of a vast number of observables. The high luminosity produces a large amount of experimental data spanning a large observable space, posing a significant data-processing challenge. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose quantum searching neighbor~(QSN) and variational QSN~(VQSN) algorithms to search for NP. The QSN is a classification algorithm. The VQSN introduces variation to the QSN to process classical data. As applications, we apply the (V)QSN in the phenomenological study of the NP at the Large Hadron Collider and muon colliders. The results indicate that the VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M'bark Amghar, Noura Chabar, Mohamed Amazioug, Amjad Sohail Shah</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to investigate the magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) phenomenon, Fano resonances, and slow/fast light effects in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. The magnomechanical system consists of two cavities: the principal cavity contains two ferromagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres, and the auxiliary cavity contains an atomic assembly. These two cavities are connected via photon tunneling, with the principal cavity being driven by two electromagnetic fields. The photon-magnon and phonon-magnon couplings are responsible for the magnon-induced transparency (MIT) and MMIT observed in the probe output spectrum. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of tunneling coupling, atom-photon coupling, and the magnetic field on the absorption, dispersion, and transmission spectra. We provide an explanation of the mechanism behind the Fano resonance phenomenon. Additionally, we address the phenomenon of slow and light propagation. Moreover, we demonstrate that group delay of the probe field can be improved by increasing photon tunneling strength. We also show that the slow light profile is decreased by adjusting the atom-photon coupling strength. This model is experimentally feasible. We hope these findings have the potential to be applied to the processing of quantum information and communication.</p>

            <h2>Post-Variational Ground State Estimation via QPE-Based Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nora Bauer, George Siopsis</p>
            <p>Quantum phase estimation (QPE) plays a pivotal role in many quantum algorithms, offering provable speedups in applications such as Shor's factoring algorithm. While fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for combinatorial and Hamiltonian optimization often integrate QPE with variational protocols-like the quantum approximate optimization Ansatz or variational quantum eigensolver-these approaches typically rely on heuristic techniques requiring parameter optimization. In this work, we present the QPE-based quantum imaginary time evolution (QPE-QITE) algorithm, designed for post-variational ground state estimation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Unlike variational methods, QPE-QITE employs additional ancillae to project the quantum register into low-energy eigenstates, eliminating the need for parameter optimization. We demonstrate the capabilities of QPE-QITE by applying it to the low-autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) problem, which is a higher order optimization problem that has been studied in the context of quantum scaling advantage. Scaling estimates for magic state requirements are provided to assess the feasibility of addressing these problems on near-term fault-tolerant devices, establishing a benchmark for quantum advantage. Moreover, we discuss potential implementations of QPE-QITE on existing quantum hardware as a precursor to fault tolerance.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Authentication Protocols for Advanced Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suchetana Goswami, Mina Doosti, Elham Kashefi</p>
            <p>Authentication is a fundamental building block of secure quantum networks, essential for quantum cryptographic protocols and often debated as a key limitation of quantum key distribution (QKD) in security standards. Most quantum-safe authentication schemes rely on small pre-shared keys or post-quantum computational assumptions. In this work, we introduce a new authentication approach that combines hardware assumptions, particularly Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), along with fundamental quantum properties of non-local states, such as local indistinguishability, to achieve provable security in entanglement-based protocols. We propose two protocols for different scenarios in entanglement-enabled quantum networks. The first protocol, referred to as the offline protocol, requires pre-distributed entangled states but no quantum communication during the authentication phase. It enables a server to authenticate clients at any time with only minimal classical communication. The second, an online protocol, requires quantum communication but only necessitates entangled state generation on the prover side. For this, we introduce a novel hardware module, the Hybrid Entangled PUF (HEPUF). Both protocols use weakly secure, off-the-shelf classical PUFs as their hardware module, yet we prove that quantum properties such as local indistinguishability enable exponential security for authentication, even in a single round. We provide full security analysis for both protocols and establish them as the first entanglement-based extension of hardware-based quantum authentication. These protocols are suitable for implementation across various platforms, particularly photonics-based ones, and offer a practical and flexible solution to the long-standing challenge of authentication in quantum communication networks.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Error Correction for Entanglement Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijie Cheng, Narayanan Rengaswamy</p>
            <p>Quantum network applications impose a variety of requirements on entanglement resources in terms of rate, fidelity, latency, and more. The repeaters in the quantum network must combine good methods for entanglement generation, effective entanglement distillation, and smart routing protocols to satisfy these application requirements. In this work, we focus on quantum error correction-based entanglement distillation in a linear chain of quantum repeaters. While conventional approaches reuse the same distillation scheme over multiple hop lengths after entanglement swaps, we propose a novel adaptive error correction scheme that boosts end-to-end metrics. Specifically, depending on the network operation point, we adapt the code used in distillation over successive rounds to monotonically increase the rate while also improving fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using three codes: [[9,1,3]], [[9,2,3]], [[9,3,3]]. We compare the performance of four different protocols that combine the codes in different ways, where we define a new performance metric, efficiency, that incorporates both overall rate and fidelity. While we highlight our innovation under minimal assumptions on noise, the method can be easily generalized to realistic network settings. By combining our approach with good entanglement generation methods and smart routing protocols, we can achieve application requirements in a systematic, resource-efficient, way.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulations of nuclear resonances with variational methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutosh Singh, Pooja Siwach, P. Arumugam</p>
            <p>The many-body nature of nuclear physics problems poses significant computational challenges. These challenges become even more pronounced when studying the resonance states of nuclear systems, which are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Quantum computing, particularly for quantum many-body systems, offers a promising alternative, especially within the constraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work aims to simulate nuclear resonances using quantum algorithms by developing a variational framework compatible with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and implementing it fully on a quantum simulator. We employ the complex scaling technique to extract resonance positions classically and adapt it for quantum simulations using a two-step algorithm. First, we transform the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost function within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory calculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy plane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code (GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach using a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully reproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the method to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the resonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can be implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input beyond the Hamiltonian. The results establish a scalable and efficient quantum framework for simulating resonance phenomena in nuclear systems. This work represents a significant step toward quantum simulations of open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Hardware Co-Designed Optimal Control for Programmable Atomic Quantum Processors via Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Ding, Dirk Englund</p>
            <p>Developing scalable, fault-tolerant atomic quantum processors requires precise control over large arrays of optical beams. This remains a major challenge due to inherent imperfections in classical control hardware, such as inter-channel crosstalk and beam leakage. In this work, we introduce a hardware co-designed intelligent quantum control framework to address these limitations. We construct a mathematical model of the photonic control hardware, integrate it into the quantum optimal control (QOC) framework, and apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover optimal control strategies. We demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, high-fidelity parallel single-qubit gate operations under realistic control conditions, where each atom is individually addressed by an optical beam. Specifically, we implement and benchmark three optimization strategies: a classical hybrid Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution-Adam (SADE-Adam) optimizer, a conventional RL approach based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and a novel end-to-end differentiable RL method. Using SADE-Adam as a baseline, we find that while PPO performance degrades as system complexity increases, the end-to-end differentiable RL consistently achieves gate fidelities above 99.9$\%$, exhibits faster convergence, and maintains robustness under varied channel crosstalk strength and randomized dynamic control imperfections.</p>

            <p>A fundamental problem in quantum information processing is the discrimination among a set of orthogonal quantum states of a composite system under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Corresponding to the LOCC indistinguishable sets of four ququad-ququad orthogonal maximally entangled states (MESs) constructed by Yu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 020506 (2012)], the maximum commutative sets (MCSs) were introduced as detectors for the local distinguishability of the set of generalized Bell states (GBSs), for which the detectors are sufficient to determine the LOCC distinguishability. In this work, we show how to determine all the detectors for a given GBS set. We construct also several 4-GBS sets without detectors, most of which are one-way LOCC indistinguishable and only one is one-way LOCC distinguishable, indicating that the detectors are not necessary for LOCC distinguishability. Furthermore, we show that for 4-GBS sets in quantum system $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$, the detectors are almost necessary for one-way LOCC distinguishability, except for one set in the sense of local unitary equivalence. The problem of one-way LOCC discrimination of 4-GBS sets in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$ is completely resolved.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun-Hyun Youn</p>
            <p>The modification of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations by boundary conditions is a fundamental prediction of quantum electrodynamics (QED). However, direct experimental verification in the optical regime is hindered by the need for sub-wavelength spatial resolution. Here, we present a novel approach to indirectly probe the spatial distribution of vacuum fluctuations by leveraging radio-frequency (RF) measurements of thermal noise. At RF frequencies, thermal noise, which occupies the same electromagnetic modes as vacuum fluctuations and is similarly shaped by boundary conditions, dominates the single-photon energy. By precisely characterizing the spatial distribution of thermal noise near a conducting boundary, we infer the corresponding modification of vacuum modes and, consequently, the vacuum fluctuations themselves. Our experimental setup, employing coaxial cables and RF splitters to mimic optical mirrors and beam splitters, enables controlled manipulation of boundary conditions and precise thermal noise measurements. We observe a reduction in thermal noise near the conducting boundary, providing indirect evidence for the theoretically predicted suppression of vacuum fluctuations. This work establishes a new experimental framework for investigating QED effects in constrained environments, with potential implications for quantum-limited precision measurements, such as gravitational wave detection and intensity-stabilized light sources. This RF approach circumvents the limitations of optical techniques and opens new avenues for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p>Gaussian quantum mechanics is a powerful tool regularly used in quantum optics to model linear and quadratic Hamiltonians efficiently. Recent interest in qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge, namely, how to fully manipulate superpositions of Gaussian states. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. Specifically, we evaluate the phase necessary to equate the unitary representation of a zero-mean Gaussian state with its Fock representation. This allows for the coherent manipulation of superpositions of Gaussian states, especially the evaluation of expectation values from these superposed states. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol using quadratic detectors in a regime that has previously been impossible to solve. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime.</p>

            <p>The development of prototype quantum information processors has progressed to a stage where small instances of logical qubit systems perform better than the best of their physical constituents. Advancing towards fault-tolerant quantum computing will require an understanding of the underlying error mechanisms in logical primitives as they relate to the performance of quantum error correction. In this work we demonstrate the novel capability to characterize the physical error properties relevant to fault-tolerant operations via cycle error reconstruction. We illustrate this diagnostic capability for a transversal CNOT, a prototypical component of quantum logical operations, in a 16-qubit register of a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our error characterization technique offers three key capabilities: (i) identifying context-dependent physical layer errors, enabling their mitigation; (ii) contextualizing component gates in the environment of logical operators, validating the performance differences in terms of characterized component-level physics, and (iii) providing a scalable method for predicting quantum error correction performance using pertinent error terms, differentiating correctable versus uncorrectable physical layer errors. The methods with which our results are obtained have scalable resource requirements that can be extended with moderate overhead to capture overall logical performance in increasingly large and complex systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Roy, Shamik Gupta, Giovanna Morigi</p>
            <p>Quantum resetting protocols can speed up the time in which a quantum walker reaches a target site on a lattice. In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our predictions can be verified in existing experimental setups.</p>

            <p>Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep connections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in open quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system size. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of scrambling transition, discovered using one particular definition, appears in operator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend previous studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the scramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum error correction (QEC) across hardware platforms have demonstrated operation near and beyond the fault-tolerance threshold, yet achieving exponential suppression of logical errors through code scaling remains a critical challenge. Erasure qubits, which enable hardware-level detection of dominant error types, offer a promising path toward resource-efficient QEC by exploiting error bias. Single erasure qubits with dual-rail encoding in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high coherence and low single-qubit gate errors with mid-circuit erasure detection, but the generation of multi-qubit entanglement--a fundamental requirement for quantum computation and error correction--has remained an outstanding milestone. Here, we demonstrate a superconducting processor integrating four dual-rail erasure qubits that achieves the logical multi-qubit entanglement with error-biased protection. Each dual-rail qubit, encoded in pairs of tunable transmons, preserves millisecond-scale coherence times and single-qubit gate errors at the level of $10^{-5}$. By engineering tunable couplings between logical qubits, we generate high-fidelity entangled states resilient to physical qubit noise, including logical Bell states (98.8% fidelity) and a three-logical-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state (93.5% fidelity). A universal gate set is realized through a calibrated logical controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate with 96.2% process fidelity, enabled by coupler-activated $XX$ interactions in the protected logical subspace. This work advances dual-rail architectures beyond single-qubit demonstrations, providing a blueprint for concatenated quantum error correction with erasure qubits.</p>

            <p>The quantum interference between a coherent state and a single photon is an important tool in continuous variable optical quantum technologies to characterize and engineer non-Gaussian quantum states. Semiconductor quantum dots, which have recently emerged as a key platform for efficient single-photon generation, could become interesting assets in this context. An essential parameter for interfering single photons and classical fields is the mean wavepacket overlap between both fields. Here, we report on two homodyne photon-correlation techniques enabling the precise measurement of the overlap between a single photon generated by a quantum dot-cavity device and pulsed laser light. The different statistics of interfering fields lead to specific signatures of the quantum interference on the photon correlations at the output of the interfering beam splitter. We compare the behavior of maximized overlap, measuring either the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility between both outputs or the photon bunching at a single output. Through careful tailoring of the laser light in various degrees of freedom, we maximize the overlap to $76\,\%$, with limitations primarily due to mismatched spectral and temporal profiles and low-frequency charge noise in the single-photon source.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungbae Yoon, Keyuan Zhong, Guoqing Wang, Boning Li, Donghun Lee, Paola Cappellaro</p>
            <p>Achieving high-frequency spectral resolution with quantum sensors, while crucial in fields ranging from physical to biological sciences, is challenging due to their finite coherence time. Here, we introduce a novel protocol that achieves this goal by measuring phase correlations of AC magnetic fields using ensembles of NV centers. Our method extends the sensing dynamic range to frequencies higher than the system's Rabi frequency while achieving arbitrary frequency resolution, limited only by the target field coherence time. Moreover, our approach operates more robustly with respect to the magnetic field's amplitude. Thanks to this robustness, our protocol allows the application of more $\pi$-pulses in pulse sequences such as CPMG, enabling the decoupling of a broader range of frequency noise. The higher harmonics generated in this process continue to act as a part of the signal, ultimately improving the frequency resolution. This method paves the way for achieving arbitrary frequency resolution with improved performances, making it highly versatile for quantum sensing applications across diverse scientific fields.</p>

            <p>Photoisomerization, a photochemical process underlying many biological mechanisms, has been modeled recently within the quantum resource theory of thermodynamics. This approach has emerged as a promising tool for studying fundamental limitations to nanoscale processes independently of the microscopic details governing their dynamics.

Here, we explore quantitatively how correlations between multiple photoswitches can enhance the efficiency of photoisomerization beyond that attainable for single molecules. Furthermore, our analysis provides insights into the interplay between quantum and classical correlations in these transformations.</p>

            <p>We present a design and modeling of a scalable quantum processor architecture utilizing hole-spin qubits defined in gate-controlled germanium (Ge) quantum dots, where coherent spin-phonon coupling is predicted to facilitate qubit manipulation and long-range interactions. The architecture exploits the strong, electrically tunable spin-orbit interactions intrinsic to hole states in Ge, integrated with high-quality phononic crystal cavities (PnCCs) to enable fully electrical qubit control and phonon-mediated coupling. Employing a streamlined simulation framework built upon multiband \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}\) modeling and finite-element methods, we quantify key performance metrics, including electrically tunable \( g \)-factors ranging from \(1.3\) to \(2.0\), spin-phonon coupling strengths up to \(6.3\,\mathrm{MHz}\), phononic cavity quality factors exceeding \(10^4\), and phonon-mediated spin relaxation times (\(T_1\)) reaching milliseconds. The proposed architecture concurrently achieves extended spin coherence and rapid gate operations through strategic electric field modulation and engineered phononic bandgap environments. Furthermore, isotopically enriched high-purity Ge crystals grown in-house at the University of South Dakota, significantly enhance device coherence by minimizing disorder and hyperfine interactions. This integrated approach, merging advanced materials engineering, precise spin-orbit coupling, and phononic cavity design, establishes a promising CMOS-compatible pathway toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Hardness of observing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaozhou Feng, Zihan Cheng, Matteo Ippoliti</p>
            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the cornerstone of our understanding of quantum phases of matter. Recent works have generalized this concept to the domain of mixed states in open quantum systems, where symmetries can be realized in two distinct ways dubbed strong and weak. Novel intrinsically mixed phases of quantum matter can then be defined by the spontaneous breaking of strong symmetry down to weak symmetry. However, proposed order parameters for strong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to require exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it possible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer this question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ symmetries. We construct ensembles of pseudorandom mixed states that do not break the strong symmetry, yet are computationally indistinguishable from states that do. This rules out the existence of efficient state-agnostic protocols to detect strong-to-weak SSB.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian singularities associated with the coalescence of individual eigenvectors accompanied by the degeneracy of their complex energies. Here, we report the discovery of a generalization to the concept of EP called exceptional deficiency (ED), which features the complete coalescence of two eigenspaces with identical but arbitrarily large dimensions and the coincidence of entire spectral continua. The characteristics of the ED are studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED can induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE, resulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions of the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and propagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed using active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new frontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing challenges in related applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Kamin, John Burniston, Ernest Y.-Z. Tan</p>
            <p>We develop a flexible and robust framework for finite-size security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols under coherent attacks, applicable to both fixed- and variable-length protocols. Our approach achieves high finite-size key rates across a broad class of protocols while imposing minimal requirements. In particular, it eliminates the need for restrictive conditions such as limited repetition rates or the implementation of virtual tomography procedures. To achieve this goal, we introduce new numerical techniques for the evaluation of sandwiched conditional Rényi entropies. In doing so, we also find an alternative formulation of the "QKD cone" studied in previous work. We illustrate the versatility of our framework by applying it to several practically relevant protocols, including decoy-state protocols. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to accommodate realistic device imperfections, such as independent intensity and phase imperfections. Overall, our framework provides both greater scope of applicability and better key rates than existing techniques, especially for small block sizes, hence offering a scalable path toward secure quantum communication under realistic conditions</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Gulucu, Emre Ozan Polat</p>
            <p>Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</p>

            <p>Fibre Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) are used in various studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and quantum technologies due to the cavity's small mode volume and compact integration with optical fibres. We develop a novel $\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by $\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 $\mu$m to 700 $\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\mu$m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser machined fibre end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to demonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hing-Tong Cho, Bei-Lok Hu</p>
            <p>A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive phenomenon known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, where an extensive number of eigenstates become localized at the boundaries of a lattice with open boundaries. While the spectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions is a well-established topological indicator for predicting the skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, a suitable topological invariant to diagnose higher-order skin effects remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose a unified non-Hermitian multipole characterization framework that generalizes the concept of spectral winding to higher-order skin effects. Specifically, we develop a set of non-Hermitian multipole Bott indices capable of diagnosing skin effects of different orders. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of both first- and higher-order skin effects in non-Hermitian systems, offering new perspectives for exploring topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly decaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal compressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by the Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After linearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the impurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and sound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the fluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly provided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton with Schrödinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the impurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with the medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results are relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi or Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases.</p>

            <p>Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.</p>

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p>

            <p>We study the geodesics on the manifold of mixed quantum states for the Bures metric. It is shown that these geodesics correspond to physical non-Markovian evolutions of the system coupled to an ancilla. Furthermore, we argue that geodesics lead to optimal precision in single-parameter estimation in quantum metrology. More precisely, if the unknown parameter $x$ is a phase shift proportional to the time parametrizing the geodesic, the estimation error obtained by processing the data of measurements on the system is equal to the smallest error that can be achieved from joint detections on the system and ancilla, meaning that there is no information loss on this parameter in the ancilla. This error can saturate the Heisenberg bound. Reciprocally, assuming that the system-ancilla output and input states are related by a unitary $e^{-i x H}$ with $H$ a $x$-independent Hamiltonian, we show that if the error obtained from measurements on the system is equal to the minimal error obtained from joint measurements on the system and ancilla then the system evolution is given by a geodesic. In such a case, the measurement on the system bringing most information on $x$ is $x$-independent and can be determined in terms of the intersections of the geodesic with the boundary of quantum states. These results show that geodesic evolutions are of interest for high-precision detections in systems coupled to an ancilla in the absence of measurements on the ancilla.</p>

In this article, we extend these results by developing a more sophisticated transfer matrix framework applicable to three-state quantum walks with general coin matrices, enabling the analysis of a broader class of time evolution operators. Additionally, we perform numerical analyses to derive exact eigenvalues for models that were previously considered intractable, demonstrating the practical usefulness and applicability of our proposed method.</p>

            <p>Integration of quantum computing in generative machine learning models has the potential to offer benefits such as training speed-up and superior feature extraction. However, the existing quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) fail to generate high-quality images due to their patch-based, pixel-wise learning approaches. These methods capture only local details, ignoring the global structure and semantic information of images. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a quantum image generative learning (QIGL) approach for high-quality medical image generation. Our proposed quantum generator leverages variational quantum circuit approach addressing scalability issues by extracting principal components from the images instead of dividing them into patches. Additionally, we integrate the Wasserstein distance within the QIGL framework to generate a diverse set of medical samples. Through a systematic set of simulations on X-ray images from knee osteoarthritis and medical MNIST datasets, our model demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores compared to its classical counterpart and advanced QGAN models reported in the literature.</p>

This is done by introducing a spectral space on which the various properties of our entanglement quantifier have a direct pictorial interpretation. Notably, this approach proves particularly effective for assessing $k$-entanglement, as we show its ability to extend previously established inequalities. To enhance understanding, we also demonstrate how this framework applies to specific scenarios, encompassing both finite-dimensional cases and infinite-dimensional systems, the latter being exemplified by the time-frequency modal degree of freedom of co-propagating single photons.</p>

            <h2>Compressing Hamiltonians with ab initio downfolding for simulating strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonios M. Alvertis, Abid Khan, Norm M. Tubman</p>
            <p>The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenning Liu, Xiantao Li, Chunhao Wang, Jin-Peng Liu</p>
            <p>Modeling and simulating the protein folding process overall remains a grand challenge in computational biology. We systematically investigate end-to-end quantum algorithms for simulating various protein dynamics with effects, such as mechanical forces or stochastic noises. A major focus is the read-in of system settings for simulation, for which we discuss (i) efficient quantum algorithms to prepare initial states--whether for ensemble or single-state simulations, in particular, the first efficient procedure for preparing Gaussian pseudo-random amplitude states, and (ii) the first efficient loading of the connectivity matrices of the protein structure. For the read-out stage, our algorithms estimate a range of classical observables, including energy, low-frequency vibrational modes, density of states, displacement correlations, and optimal control parameters. Between these stages, we simulate the dynamic evolution of the protein system, by using normal mode models--such as Gaussian network models (GNM) and all-atom normal mode models. In addition, we conduct classical numerical experiments focused on accurately estimating the density of states and applying optimal control to facilitate conformational changes. These experiments serve to validate our claims regarding potential quantum speedups. Overall, our study demonstrates that quantum simulation of protein dynamics represents a robust, end-to-end application for both early-stage and fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Hilbert subspace ergodicity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonard Logaric, John Goold, Shane Dooley</p>
            <p>Ergodicity has been one of the fundamental concepts underpinning our understanding of thermalization in isolated systems since the first developments in classical statistical mechanics. Recently, a similar notion has been introduced for quantum systems, termed complete Hilbert space ergodicity (CHSE), in which the evolving quantum state explores all of the available Hilbert space. This contrasts with the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH), in which thermalisation is formulated via the properties of matrix elements of local operators in the energy eigenbasis. In this work we explore how ETH-violation mechanisms, including quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation can affect complete Hilbert space ergodicity. We find that the presence of these mechanisms leads to CHSE in decoupled subspaces, a phenomenon we call Hilbert Subspace Ergodicity, and which represents a protocol for constructing t-designs in subspaces.</p>

            <p>Determining a beam's full trajectory requires tracking both its position and momentum (angular) information. However, the product of position and momentum uncertainty in a simultaneous measurement of the two parameters is bound by the Heisenberg uncertainty limit (HUL). In this work, we present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum-enhanced beam tracking technique, leveraging the inherent position and momentum entanglement between photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). We show that quantum entanglement can be exploited to achieve a beam tracking accuracy beyond the HUL in a simultaneous measurement. Moreover, with existing detection technologies, it is already possible to achieve near real-time beam tracking capabilities at the single-photon level. The technique also exhibits high resilience to background influences, with negligible reduction in tracking accuracy even when subjected to a disruptive beam that is significantly brighter than SPDC.</p>

            <p>Advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing and fundamental science necessitates quantum-limited amplifiers with near-ideal quantum efficiency and multiplexing capability. However, existing solutions typically achieve one at the expense of the other. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first Floquet-mode traveling-wave parametric amplifier (Floquet TWPA), which achieves nearly quantum-limited noise performance, minimal dissipation, and broadband operation, breaking the presumption that broadband amplifiers introduce higher noise. We achieve a system measurement efficiency of $65.1\pm5.8\%$ when measuring a superconducting qubit, which to our knowledge is the highest-reported in a superconducting qubit readout experiment utilizing phase-preserving amplifiers. Our device exhibits $>20$-dB amplification over a $3$-GHz instantaneous bandwidth, $<\!0.5\,$-dB average in-band insertion loss, and the highest reported intrinsic quantum efficiency for a TWPA of $92.1\pm7.6\%$, relative to an ideal phase-preserving amplifier. Fabricated in a superconducting qubit process, these general-purpose Floquet TWPAs are suitable for fast, high-fidelity multiplexed readout in large-scale quantum systems and future monolithic integration with quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenan Wei, Liu Yang, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians describe open quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and dissipative processes. Although a rich range of single-particle NH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH systems have been far less well studied.

Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization group (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative solution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase diagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo model, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable fixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in regimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe ansatz, is provided open source.</p>

            <h2>No-Go Theorems for Universal Quantum State Purification via Classically Simulable Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keming He, Chengkai Zhu, Hongshun Yao, Jinguo Liu, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum state purification, a process that aims to recover a state closer to a system's principal eigenstate from multiple copies of an unknown noisy quantum state, is crucial for restoring noisy states to a more useful form in quantum information processing. Fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on stabilizer operations, which are classically simulable protocols critical for error correction but inherently limited in computational power. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classically simulable operations for quantum state purification. We demonstrate that while certain classically simulable operations can enhance fidelity for specific noisy state ensembles, they cannot achieve universal purification. We prove that neither deterministic nor probabilistic protocols using only classically simulable operations can achieve universal purification of two-copy noisy states for qubit systems and all odd dimensions. We further extend this no-go result of state purification using three and four copies via numerical computations of semidefinite programs. Our findings highlight the indispensable role of non-stabilizer resources and the inherent limitations of classically simulable operations in quantum state purification, emphasizing the necessity of harnessing the full power of quantum operations for more robust quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>An Efficient Quantum Classifier Based on Hamiltonian Representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Tiblias, Anna Schroeder, Yue Zhang, Mariami Gachechiladze, Iryna Gurevych</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is a discipline that seeks to transfer the advantages of quantum computing to data-driven tasks. However, many studies rely on toy datasets or heavy feature reduction, raising concerns about their scalability. Progress is further hindered by hardware limitations and the significant costs of encoding dense vector representations on quantum devices. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient approach called Hamiltonian classifier that circumvents the costs associated with data encoding by mapping inputs to a finite set of Pauli strings and computing predictions as their expectation values. In addition, we introduce two classifier variants with different scaling in terms of parameters and sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on text and image classification tasks, against well-established classical and quantum models. The Hamiltonian classifier delivers performance comparable to or better than these methods. Notably, our method achieves logarithmic complexity in both qubits and quantum gates, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-world applications. We make our implementation available on GitHub.</p>

            <p>The Casimir effect and superconductivity are foundational quantum phenomena whose interaction remains an open question in physics. How Casimir forces behave across a superconducting transition remains unresolved, owing to the experimental difficulty of achieving alignment, cryogenic environments, and isolating small changes from competing effects. This question carries implications for electron physics, quantum gravity, and high-temperature superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an on-chip superconducting platform that overcomes these challenges, achieving one of the most parallel Casimir configurations to date. Our microchip-based cavities achieve unprecedented area-to-separation ratio between plates, exceeding previous Casimir experiments by orders of magnitude and generating the strongest Casimir forces yet between compliant surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used for the first time to directly detect the resonant motion of a suspended membrane, with subatomic precision in both lateral positioning and displacement. Such precision measurements across a superconducting transition allow for the suppression of all van der Waals, electrostatic, and thermal effects. Preliminary measurements suggest superconductivity-dependent shifts in the Casimir force, motivating further investigation and comparison with theories. By uniting extreme parallelism, nanomechanics, and STM readout, our platform opens a new experimental frontier at the intersection of Casimir physics and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive, low-cost, reagent-less, and rapid technique to measure chemical concentrations in a wide variety of sample types. However, extracting concentration information from the NIR spectrum requires training a statistical model on a large collection of measurements, which can be impractical, expensive, or dangerous. In this work, we propose a method for simulating NIR spectra on a quantum computer, as part of a larger workflow to improve NIR-based chemical detection. The quantum algorithm is highly optimized, exhibiting a cost reduction of many orders of magnitude relative to prior approaches. The main optimizations include the localization of vibrational modes, an efficient real-space-based representation of the Hamiltonian with a quantum arithmetic-based implementation of the time-evolution, optimal Trotter step size determination, and specific targeting of the NIR region. Overall, our algorithm achieves a O(M^2) scaling, compared with the O(M^12) coming from equivalent high-accuracy classical methods. As a concrete application, we show that simulating the spectrum of azidoacetylene (HC2N3), a highly explosive molecule with strong anharmonicities consisting of M = 12 vibrational modes, requires circuits with a maximum 8.47 x 10^8 T gates and 173 logical qubits. By enhancing the training datasets of detection models, the full potential of vibrational spectroscopy for chemical detection could be unlocked across a range of applications, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and medical sensing.</p>

We apply our method to study the generation of single-mode GKP states via cat state breeding, and the formation of multimode GKP cluster states via linear optical circuits and homodyne measurements. We characterize resource states by referring to expectation values of their stabilizers, and witness operators constructed from them. Our method reproduces the results of standard Fock-basis simulations, while being more efficient, and being applicable in a broader parameter space. We also comment on the validity of the heuristic Gaussian random noise (GRN) model, through comparisons with our exact simulations: We find discrepancies in the stabilizer expectation values when homodyne measurement is involved in cluster state preparation, yet we find a close agreement between the two approaches on average.</p>

In our experiments, the qubit is coupled to an open coplanar waveguide such that the transmission of microwaves through this line depends on the qubit's state. To determine the occupation of the first excited qubit energy level, we introduced a two-pulse technique. The first applied pulse, at a frequency close to the eigenfrequency of the qubit, serves to excite the qubit. A second pulse is then used for probing the transition between the first and second excited energy levels. Utilizing this measurement technique allowed for the reconstruction of the relaxation dynamics and Rabi oscillations.

Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the performance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field, shedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic processes. Further, we demonstrate how the DCE can be harnessed to implement a controlled-squeeze gate within a cQED platform, opening a path toward advanced quantum control and quantum information processing.

            <p>Analyzing the kinetics of biological processes plays a significant role in understanding fundamental cellular functions. Many physics-based technologies used to study such processes are limited by the shot noise inherent to the coherent states of light. These technologies can greatly benefit by leveraging quantum probes to improve the sensitivity of measurements in cellular biology. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique has been used effectively to achieve label-free, real-time measurements of protein binding kinetics, which constitutes an important biological phenomenon occurring near the cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate the integration of this technique with the two-mode bright squeezed state having fewer fluctuations as compared to the coherent state to improve the sensitivity of measurement in studying a protein-gold adsorption process. We show 4dB of squeezing as we record the signal-to-noise ratio as the function of time and it is maintained throughout the kinetic process. The quantum advantage as shown in terms of squeezing is achieved despite the total absorption of 74% from the source until the final detection after the sensor. Overall, we provide the most practical setup for improving the sensitivity of the time-dependent measurements involved in various biological processes at the molecular level.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.</p>

As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which can easily relax the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing offers new opportunities for addressing complex classification tasks in biomedical applications. This study investigates two quantum machine learning models-the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) and the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)-in the context of B-cell epitope prediction, a key step in modern vaccine design. QSVM builds upon the classical SVM framework by using quantum circuits to encode nonlinear kernel computations, while VQC replaces the entire classification pipeline with trainable quantum circuits optimized variationally. A benchmark dataset from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is used for model evaluation. Each epitope is represented by 10 physicochemical features, and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to assess model performance across different feature spaces. We also examine the effect of sample size on prediction outcomes. Experimental results show that QSVM performs well under limited data conditions, while VQC achieves higher accuracy in larger datasets. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced models for bioinformatics tasks, particularly in supporting efficient and scalable epitope-based vaccine development.</p>

However, identifying and characterizing differences in expressiveness between quantum programming paradigms remains an open area of study. Our work investigates the landscape of expressiveness through a comparative analysis of hosted quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, Qrisp, and quAPL, and standalone languages including Q# and Qmod. We focused on evaluating how different quantum programming languages support the implementation of core quantum algorithms -- Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover -- using expressiveness metrics: Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), and Halstead Complexity (HC) metrics as proxies for developer productivity. Our findings suggest that different quantum programming paradigms offer distinct trade-offs between expressiveness and productivity, highlighting the importance of language design in quantum software development.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Liang, Jens Niklas Eberhardt, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[79, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[374, 10, 13]]$, $[[409, 11, 13]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel "lattice grafting" optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Jacinto, Élie Gouzien, Nicolas Sangouard</p>
            <p>Physical constraints and engineering challenges, including wafer dimensions, classical control cabling, and refrigeration volumes, impose significant limitations on the scalability of quantum computing units. As a result, a modular quantum computing architecture, comprising small processors interconnected by quantum links, is emerging as a promising approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the requirements that the network must fulfill to enable distributed quantum computation remain largely unexplored. We consider an architecture tailored for qubits with nearest-neighbor physical connectivity, leveraging the surface code for error correction and enabling fault-tolerant operations through lattice surgery and magic state distillation. We propose measurement teleportation as a tool to extend lattice surgery techniques to qubits located on different computing units interconnected via Bell pairs. Through memory simulations, we build an error model for logical operations and deduce an end-to-end resource estimation of Shor's algorithm over a minimalist distributed architecture. Concretely, for a characteristic physical gate error rate of 1e-3, a processor cycle time of 1 microsecond, factoring a 2048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible with 379 computing processors, each made with 89781 qubits, with negligible space and time overhead with respect to a monolithic approach without parallelization, if 70 Bell pairs are available per cycle time between each processor with a fidelity exceeding 98.4 percent.</p>

            <p>Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Internet, a network of quantum-enabled infrastructure, represents the next frontier in telecommunications, promising unprecedented capabilities that cannot be attained by classical counterparts. A crucial step in realizing such large-scale quantum networks is the integration of entanglement distribution within existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate a real-world scalable quantum networking testbed deployed within Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fibers in Berlin. Using commercially available quantum devices and standard add-drop multiplexing hardware, we distribute polarization-entangled photon pairs over dynamically selectable fiber paths ranging from 10 m to 82 km. Quantum signals, transmitted at 1324 nm (O-band), coexist with conventional bidirectional C-band traffic without dedicated fibers or infrastructure changes. Active stabilization of the polarization enables robust long-term performance, achieving entanglement fidelities between 85-99% and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter S-values between 2.36-2.74 during continuous multiday operation. By achieving high-fidelity entanglement distribution under real urban conditions with less than 1% downtime, we confirm the feasibility of hybrid quantum-classical networks under real-world conditions at metropolitan scale. These results establish deployment benchmarks and provide a practical roadmap for telecom operators to integrate quantum capabilities.</p>

However, a major challenge in quantum simulation, and quantum computation in general, is to solve problems with limited physical hardware. Currently, this challenge is tackled by designing dedicated devices for specific models, thereby allowing to reduce control requirements and simplify the construction. Here, we suggest a new method for quantum simulation in circuit QED, that provides versatility in model design and complete control over its parameters with minimal hardware requirements. We show how these features manifest through examples of quantum simulation of Dirac dynamics, which is relevant to the study of both high-energy physics and 2D materials. We conclude by discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed method.</p>

            <p>We analyze the non-Markovian spontaneous emission dynamics of a two-level test atom placed in a cavity formed by two atomic arrays in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup. We demonstrate a crossover from single-mode to multimode strong coupling cavity QED as the cavity length $ \sim d$ becomes comparable to the coherence length associated with collective spontaneous emission $\sim v/(N\gamma)$. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics of the test atom and the emergent spectral density of the field are analyzed as a function of various tunable atomic array parameters: number of atoms, length of the atomic cavity, and resonance frequency of the atoms forming the atomic mirrors. Our results show limitations to cooperatively enhanced light-matter coupling in the presence of time-delayed feedback. We further illustrate that the non-Markovian system dynamics can be efficiently approximated in terms of a few modes of the emergent spectral density of the field.</p>

Here we demonstrate a few-emitter cavity QED system capable of realizing new Hamiltonians in quantum optics based on breaking of symmetries and the realization of an in situ Kerr nonlinearity. Our experiment relies on a high-finesse silicon carbide whispering gallery mode resonator hosting an ensemble of silicon vacancy color centers. The simultaneous presence of spectral and spatial disorder of the mesoscopic atom system gives rise to emergent chirality, and the optical nonlinearity of the silicon carbide host crystal enables the observation of atom-photon correlations induced by a four-photon nonlinear process.

            <p>The strong coupling between an emitter and a cavity is significant for advancing quantum networks. Due to their long optical and spin coherence times, rare-earth ions (REIs) represent a compelling platform for quantum networks. However, their inherently weak intra-4f optical transitions typically result in low coupling strength, thus restricting most current achievements to the weak coupling regime. This work proposes a scheme to realize an on-chip quantum network by coupling REIs to high-quality whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavities. Additionally, we provide numerical validation for a parametric amplification technique to enhance the emitter-cavity coupling strength. As an extension of this approach, the coupled system efficiently achieves the quantum entanglement of local and flying qubits. This study deepens the understanding of emitter-cavity interactions and contributes to realizing REIs-based photonic platforms, which are crucial to distributed quantum computing and developing robust quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhao, Guming Zhao, Shaowei Li, Chen Zha, Ming Gong, XiaoBo Zhu</p>
            <p>The fluxonium qubit has emerged as a promising candidate for superconducting quantum computing due to its long coherence times and high-fidelity gates. Nonetheless, further scaling up and improving performance remain critical challenges for establishing fluxoniums as a viable alternative to transmons. A key obstacle lies in developing scalable coupling architectures. In this work, we introduce a scalable fluxonium architecture that enables decoupling of qubit states while maintaining tunable couplings between non-computational states. Beyond the well-studied ZZ crosstalk, we identify that an always-on interaction involving non-computational levels can significantly degrade the fidelities of initialization, control, and readout in large systems, thereby impeding scalability. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by implementing tunable couplings for fluxonium's plasmon transitions, meanwhile enabling fast, high-fidelity gates with passive ZZ suppression. Furthermore, since fluxonium transitions span multiple frequency octaves, we emphasize the importance of carefully designing coupling mechanisms and parameters to suppress residual interactions.</p>

            <p>To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical resource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks, semiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases efficiency and bandwidth, but it also introduces environmental charge instability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon colour centres have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum technologies. Here we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in nanophotonics-coupled, individual silicon T centres using spectral correlation measurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by the near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5 ms in the dark. We demonstrate a 35x narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110 MHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise entanglement rates and optical resource state generators. Finally, we report laser-induced spin-mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms common to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T centre devices for high-performance entanglement generation.</p>

            <p>Quantum technologies hold promise as essential components for the upcoming deployment of the future 6G network. In this future network, the security and trustworthiness requirements are not considered fulfilled with the current state of the quantum computers, as the malicious behaviour on the part of the service provider towards the user may still be present. Therefore, this article provides an initial interdisciplinary work of regulations and solutions in the scope of trustworthy quantum computing for future 6G that can be viewed as complimentary regulations to the existing strategies shared by different actors of states and organizations. More precisely, we describe the importance of a reliable quantum service provider and its implication on the ethical aspects concerning digital sovereignty. By exploring the critical relationship between trustworthiness and digital sovereignty in the context of future 6G networks, we analyse a trade-off between accessibility to this new technology and preservation of digital sovereignty engaging in parallel the United Nation's (UN's) sustainable development goals. Furthermore, we propose a partnership model based on cooperation, coordination, and collaboration giving rise to a trusted, ethical, and inclusive quantum ecosystem, whose implications can spill over to the entire global scenario.</p>

            <p>In the Quantum Internet, multipartite entanglement enables a new form of network connectivity, referred to as artificial connectivity namely and able to augment the physical connectivity with artificial links between pairs of nodes, without any additional physical link deployment. In this paper, by engineering such an artificial connectivity, we theoretically determine upper and lower bounds for the number of EPR pairs and GHZ states that can be extracted among nodes that are not adjacent in the artificial network topology. The aforementioned analysis is crucial, since the extraction of EPR pairs and GHZ states among remote nodes constitutes the resource primitives for on-demand and end-to-end communications. Indeed, within the paper, we not only determine whether a certain number of remote EPR pairs and GHZ states can be extracted, but we also provide the locations, namely the identities, of the nodes interconnected by such entangled resources. Thus, our analysis is far from being purely theoretical, rather it is constructive, since we provide the sequence of operations required for performing such extractions.</p>

            <p>Cross-talk between qubits is one of the main challenges for scaling superconducting quantum processors. Here, we use the density-matrix renormalization-group to numerically analyze lattices of superconducting qubits from a perspective of many-body localization. Specifically, we compare different architectures that include tunable couplers designed to decouple qubits in the idle state, and calculate the residual ZZ interactions as well as the inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states. For transmon qubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable C-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ interactions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture with tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong suppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of transmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may feature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve similar gate speeds and fidelities.</p>

Combined with techniques from Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, we show that properties such as PARITY and MAJORITY are compression oblivious for certain circuit class $\Lambda$ if subexponentially secure quantum pseudorandom functions exist in $\Lambda$, answering an open question in [Buhrman-Patro-Speelman 2021].</p>

            <p>The study of holographic bulk-boundary dualities has led to the construction of novel quantum error correcting codes. Although these codes have shed new light on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a new class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction generalizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated codes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the holographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high erasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed codes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes achieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\%$ reduction for a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard concatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations with tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal fault-tolerant gate sets. Therefore, our work strengthens the case for the utility of holographic quantum codes for practical quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Characterization of near-term quantum computing platforms requires the ability to capture and quantify dissipative effects. This is an inherently challenging task, as these effects are multifaceted, spanning a broad spectrum from Markovian to strongly non-Markovian dynamics. We introduce Quantum Liouvillian Tomography (QLT), a protocol to capture and quantify non-Markovian effects in time-continuous quantum dynamics. The protocol leverages gradient-based quantum process tomography to reconstruct dynamical maps and utilizes regression over the derivatives of Pauli string probability distributions to extract the Liouvillian governing the dynamics. We benchmark the protocol using synthetic data and quantify its accuracy in recovering Hamiltonians, jump operators, and dissipation rates for two-qubit systems. Finally, we apply QLT to analyze the evolution of an idling two-qubit system implemented on a superconducting quantum platform to extract characteristics of Hamiltonian and dissipative components and, as a result, detect inherently non-Markovian dynamics. Our work introduces the first protocol capable of retrieving generators of generic open quantum evolution from experimental data, thus enabling more precise characterization of many-body non-Markovian effects in near-term quantum computing platforms.</p>

The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the regime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon linewidth.</p>

We prove that capacities of such channels are approximately strongly additive and can be efficiently approximated in terms of the structure of their peripheral spaces. Furthermore, the quantum and private classical capacities of such channels approximately coincide and approximately satisfy the strong converse property. We show that these approximate results become exact for the corresponding zero-error capacities when $l \geq d^2$. To prove these results, we show that for any channel $\Psi$, the classical, private classical, and quantum capacities of $\Psi_\infty$, which is its so-called asymptotic part, satisfy the strong converse property and are strongly additive. In the zero-error case, we introduce the notion of the stabilized non-commutative confusability graph of a quantum channel and characterize its structure for any given channel.</p>

Our framework establishes that quantum systems in the same topological phase exhibit consistent barcode representations with shared persistent homology groups over characteristic intervals. We prove that quantum phase transitions manifest as significant changes in these persistent homology features, detectable through discontinuities in the persistent Dirac operator spectrum. Using the SSH model as a demonstrative example, we show how our approach successfully identifies the topological phase transition and distinguishes between trivial and topological phases. While primarily developed for symmetry-protected topological phases, our framework provides a mathematical connection between persistent homology and quantum topology, offering new methods for phase classification that complement traditional invariant-based approaches.</p>

            <h2>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semra Gurtas Dogan, Kobra Hasanirokh, Omar Mustafa, Abdullah Guvendi</p>
            <p>This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum inference problems and quantum hidden Markov models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun Woo P. Kim, Curt von Keyserlingk, Austen Lamacraft</p>
            <p>Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Magnon Polaritons via Eddy-Current-Induced Dissipation in Metallic-Banded YIG Spheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsushi Uno, Shugo Yoshii, Sotaro Mae, Ei Shigematsu, Ryo Ohshima, Yuichiro Ando, Masashi Shiraishi</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a robust method to dynamically tune magnon dissipation in yttrium iron garnet spheres by equipping a metallic band around the sphere's equator, enabling precise control over magnon-photon coupling states. The collective magnetization dynamics in the YIG sphere induce circular eddy currents in the metallic band, whose magnitude can be systematically varied by adjusting the angle between the metallic band plane and an external static magnetic field. This angular dependence yields a pronounced modulation of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth, facilitating seamless transitions between the Purcell and strong coupling regimes without altering photon cavity parameters. Systematic FMR and cavity spectroscopy measurements confirm that eddy-current-induced losses govern the primary mechanism behind the observed tunable damping. By achieving extensive periodic-angular dependence of magnon relaxation rate, we precisely control the magnon-photon coupling state, approaching the critical coupling condition. These results establish the YIG-metallic-band platform as a versatile and practical approach for engineering tunable magnon-polariton systems and advancing magnonic applications, including those exploring non-Hermitian magnonics.</p>

            <h2>Observability of Acausal and Uncorrelated Optical-Quasar Pairs for Quantum-Mechanical Experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Steinbring</p>
            <p>Viewing high-redshift sources at near-opposite directions on the sky can assure, by light-travel-time arguments, acausality between their emitted photons. One utility would be true random-number generation, by sensing these via two independent telescopes that each flip a switch based on those latest-arrived colours; for example, to autonomously control a quantum-mechanical (QM) experiment. Although demonstrated with distant quasars, those were not fully acausal pairs, which are restricted in simultaneous view from the ground at any single observatory. In optical light such faint sources also require large telescope aperture to avoid sampling assumptions when imaged at fast camera framerates: either unsensed intrinsic correlations between them or equivalently-correlated noise may ruin the expectation of pure randomness. One such case which could spoil a QM test is considered. Based on that, allowed geometries and instrumental limits are modelled for any two ground-based sites, and their data simulated. To compare, an analysis of photometry from the Gemini twin 8-m telescopes is presented, using archival data of well-separated bright stars, obtained with the instruments 'Alopeke (on Gemini-North in Hawai'i) and Zorro (on Gemini-South in Chile) simultaneously in two bands (centred at 562 nm and 832 nm) with 17 Hz framerate. No flux correlation is found, calibrating an analytic model, predicting where a search at signal-to-noise over 50 at 50 Hz with the same instrumentation can be made. Finally, the software PDQ (Predict Different Quasars) is presented which searches a large catalogue of known quasars, reporting those with brightness and visibility suitable to verify acausal, uncorrelated photons at those limits.</p>

            <h2>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</h2>

            <p>Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for linking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingying Han, Changfa He, Zhenxiong Weng, Peng Xu, Yanting Zhao, Tao Wang</p>
            <p>We present a Rydberg-atom interferometry-based technique for voltage measurement between electrodes embedded in an atomic vapor cell, enabling the detection of weak voltages ($<0.1$V) and unambiguous discrimination between positive and negative polarities. This makes up for the shortcomings of measurements based on the Stark effect, which suffer from quadratic field dependence (limiting sensitivity in weak-field regimes) and incapable of distinguishing the electric field direction. Furthermore, this method extends naturally to power-frequency (PF) electric field measurements by exploiting the quasi-static approximation-valid given the PF field's characteristic timescale ($\sim10^{-2}$s) vastly exceeds the interferometric measurement duration ($\sim10^{-6}$s). Crucially, our protocol provides instantaneous PF field reconstruction, providing comprehensive information including amplitude, frequency and phase. These advancements have direct implications for traceable voltage measurements and non-invasive characterization of PF fields near high-voltage infrastructure.</p>

            <p>In recent years, micromachined vapor cells have been revolutionizing the field of chip-scale quantum sensors such as magnetometers and atomic clocks. In parallel, Rydberg atomic quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful technique for broadband, non-invasive, and ultra-sensitive electrometry. Yet, to date, Rydberg sensing has largely been limited to glass-blown, cm-scale vapor cells. Here, we perform Rydberg spectroscopy using a wafer-scale fabricated Pyrex-Si-Pyrex cell with mm-scale dimensions. The Rydberg spectroscopic line is characterized with respect to critical parameters such as temperature, the frequency and amplitude of the applied radiofrequency field, light intensity, and the spatial position of atom interrogation. Our study reveals lineshapes directly influenced by a complex landscape of electrostatic fields with values up to approximately $0.6\ \mathrm{V/cm}$. By controlling key parameters, we were able to reduce the effect of these internal electric fields and demonstrate the detection of RF fields with a sensitivity as low as $10\ \mu\mathrm{V/cm}$. These results highlight the potential of micromachined vapor cells for sub-wavelength electromagnetic field measurements, with applications in communications, near-field RF imaging, and chip-scale quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. I. Mukhin</p>
            <p>Proposed recently by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates (2022) was supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (2023). In the present paper it is demonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity arises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding experimental data in the "strange metal" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as reviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the "strange metal" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by this http URL et al. (2010) in the "strange metal" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a possible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$ cuprates in the "strange metal" phase of their phase diagram. We believe , these results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model of the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.</p>

            <p>We present a novel stochastic variational method (SVM) for quantizing non-relativistic spinless particles in curved spaces with torsion. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited for quantization in general coordinate systems and shows that torsion, typically associated with spin, can influence the quantum dynamics of spinless particles through quantum fluctuations. In a flat space, this torsion-induced effect appears as a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation, which is relevant to studies of solitons, wave function collapse, and possible modifications to conventional quantum mechanics. Since torsion arises in various modified gravity theories, particularly those related to the early universe and dark matter, our findings suggest a new mechanism through which such effects may impact quantum behavior. We also provide a rough estimate for the upper bound of the torsion magnitude.</p>

This level of sensitivity is sufficient to resolve the Rydberg transition of a single electron, providing a scalable pathway toward the implementation of qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</p>

Reflection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet, which in its single-mode limit are consistent with those in the stationary scattering off the potential step alone, are investigated up to the second order. We show that even in the absence of the so-called Klein region, a positive-frequency incoming wave can penetrate the negative-frequency region below the potential step by emitting its energy to the oscillating electric field with a finite tunneling probability.</p>

The black hole information loss paradox arises from semiclassical arguments suggesting that, even in a closed system, the process of black hole formation and evaporation evolves a pure state into a mixed state. Resolution to the paradox typically demands violation of quantum mechanics or relativity in domains where they should hold. Instead, I propose that in a complete theory of quantum gravity, any region $\mathcal{U}$ that could collapse into a black hole should already be described by a mixed state, thus bypassing the paradox entirely. To that end, I present a model in which the universe is in a quantum error-corrected state, such that any local black hole appears mixed and encodes no information locally.</p>

            <p>Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>Thermalization phenomena, while ubiquitous in quantum systems, have traditionally been viewed as obstacles to be mitigated. In this study, we demonstrate the ability, instead, to harness thermalization to dynamically engineer and stabilize structured quantum states in a mesoscopically large ensemble of spins. Specifically, we showcase the capacity to generate, control, stabilize, and read out 'shell-like' spin texture with interacting $ {}^{ 13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The texture spans several nanometers and encompasses many hundred spins. We capitalize on the thermalization process to impose a quasi-equilibrium upon the generated texture; as a result, it is highly stable, immune to spin diffusion, and endures over multiple-minute long periods -- over a million times longer than the intrinsic interaction scale of the spins. Additionally, the texture is created and interrogated without locally controlling or probing the nuclear spins. These features are accomplished using an electron spin as a nanoscale injector of spin polarization, and employing it as a source of spatially varying dissipation, allowing for serial readout of the emergent spin texture. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-induced Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field. Our work presents a new approach to robust nanoscale spin state engineering and paves the way for new applications in quantum simulation, quantum information science, and nanoscale imaging.</p>

            <p>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems have garnered significant attention due to their unconventional properties. Despite the growing interest, there remains an ongoing debate about whether these systems outperform their Hermitian counterparts in practical applications, and if so, by what metrics this performance should be measured. We developed $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric approach for mapping $N = 3$ pure qubit states to address this, implemented it using the dilation method, and demonstrated it on a superconducting quantum processor from the IBM Quantum Experience. For the first time, we derived exact expressions for the population of the post-selected $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric subspace for both $N = 2$ and $N = 3$ states. When applied to the discrimination of $N = 2$ pure states, our algorithm provides an equivalent result to the conventional unambiguous quantum state discrimination. For $N = 3$ states, our approach introduces novel capabilities not available in traditional Hermitian systems, enabling the transformation of an arbitrary set of three pure quantum states into another, at the cost of introducing an inconclusive outcome. Our algorithm has the same error rate for the attack on the three-state QKD protocol as the conventional minimum error, maximum confidence, and maximum mutual information strategies. For post-selected quantum metrology, our results provide precise conditions where $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum sensors outperform their Hermitian counterparts in terms of information-cost rate. Combined with punctuated unstructured quantum database search, our method significantly reduces the qubit readout requirements at the cost of adding an ancilla, while maintaining the same average number of oracle calls as the original punctuated Grover's algorithm. Our work opens new pathways for applying $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in quantum communications, computing, and cryptography.</p>

            <p>The use of higher-dimensional photonic encodings (qudits) instead of two-dimensional encodings (qubits) can improve the loss tolerance and reduce the computational resources of photonic-based quantum information processing. To harness this potential, efficient schemes for entangling operations such as the high-dimensional generalization of a linear optics Bell measurement will be required. We show how an efficient high-dimensional entangled state analyzer can be implemented with a linear optics interferometer and auxiliary photonic states. The degree of entanglement of the auxiliary state is much less than in previous protocols as quantified by an exponentially smaller Schmidt rank. In addition, the auxiliary state only occupies a single spatial mode, allowing it to be generated deterministically from a single quantum emitter coupled to a small qubit register. The reduced complexity of the auxiliary states results in a high robustness to imperfections and we show that auxiliary states with fidelities above 0.9 for qudit dimensions 4 can be generated in the presence of qubit error rates on the order of 10%. This paves the way for experimental demonstrations with current hardware.</p>

We define the CZ-complexity of a graph state $|G\rangle$ as the minimum number of two-qubit Clifford operations (excluding single-qubit Clifford operations) for generating $|G\rangle$ from a trivial state $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$. We first prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ two-qubit Clifford operations if and only if $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ controlled-Z (CZ) operations. We next prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated from another graph state $|H\rangle$ by $t$ CZ operations if and only if the graph $G$ is generated from $H$ by some combinatorial graph transformation with cost $t$. As the main results, we show a connection between the CZ-complexity of graph state $|G\rangle$ and the rank-width of the graph $G$. Indeed, we prove that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and rank-width $r$, 1. The CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is $O(rn)$. 2. If $G$ is connected, the CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is at least $n + r - 2$. We also demonstrate the existence of graph states whose CZ-complexities are close to the upper and lower bounds. Finally, we present quantum algorithms for preparing graph states for three specific graph classes related to intervals: interval graphs, interval containment graphs, and circle graphs. We prove that the CZ-complexity is $O(n)$ for interval graphs, and $O(n\log n)$ for both interval containment graphs and circle graphs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum optical classifier with superexponential speedup</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Roncallo, Angela Rosy Morgillo, Chiara Macchiavello, Lorenzo Maccone, Seth Lloyd</p>
            <p>Classification is a central task in deep learning algorithms. Usually, images are first captured and then processed by a sequence of operations, of which the artificial neuron represents one of the fundamental units. This paradigm requires significant resources that scale (at least) linearly in the image resolution, both in terms of photons and computational operations. Here, we present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. It classifies objects without reconstructing their images, using the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical artificial neuron.</p>

            <h2>Positive and non-positive measurements in energy extraction from quantum batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paranjoy Chaki, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Kornikar Sen, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We extend the concept of stochastic energy extraction from quantum batteries to the scenario where both positive operator-valued (POV) and physically realizable non-positive operator-valued measurements (NPOVMs) are applied on the auxiliary connected to the battery in presence of noise. The process involves joint evolution of the battery and the auxiliary, an interaction of the auxiliary with its environment which induces noise in the auxiliary, and performing a POVM or NPOVM on the auxiliary, and finally the selection of a particular measurement outcome. Application of POVM on the auxiliary can be realized by attaching an external system to the auxiliary, which is initially in a product state with the rest of the system, and performing a joint projective measurement on the auxiliary and external. On the other hand, NPOVMs can be performed in two ways: if there are interactions leading to correlations among the auxiliary and environment, then performing a projective measurement on the auxiliary environment system can be interpreted as a physically realizable NPOVM on the auxiliary. Moreover, if there exists interaction among auxiliary, environment and external initially then the global measurement on the auxiliary, environment and external is also effectively an NPOVM on the auxiliary. We find the expressions of the maximum stochastically extractable energy by performing POVMs and NPOVMs of both types on the auxiliary and show that the latter does not depend on the applied noise. Focusing on a particular model of a battery, auxiliary, environment, and external, all being qubits, we show that stochastically extractable energy by POVMs is less than or equal to the same by type-1 NPOVM under various noise models. We additionally consider the case when a limited set of measurement operators is allowed and compare the accessible energy using these restricted set of POVM and NPOVM of type-1.</p>

            <p>Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <p>Critical systems represent a valuable resource in quantum sensing and metrology. Critical quantum sensing (CQS) protocols can be realized using finite-component phase transitions, where criticality arises from the rescaling of system parameters rather than the thermodynamic limit. Here, we show that a collective quantum advantage can be achieved in a multipartite CQS protocol using a chain of parametrically coupled critical resonators in the weak-nonlinearity limit. We derive analytical solutions for the low-energy spectrum of this unconventional quantum many-body system, which is composed of locally critical elements. We then assess the scaling of the quantum Fisher information with respect to fundamental resources. We demonstrate that the coupled chain outperforms an equivalent ensemble of independent critical sensors, achieving quadratic scaling in the number of resonators. Finally, we show that even with finite Kerr nonlinearity or Markovian dissipation, the critical chain retains its advantage, making it relevant for implementing quantum sensors with current microwave superconducting technologies.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Second Law of Quantum Resource Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahito Hayashi, Hayata Yamasaki</p>
            <p>The second law of thermodynamics is the cornerstone of physics, characterizing the convertibility between thermodynamic states through a single function, entropy. Given the universal applicability of thermodynamics, a fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether an analogous second law can be formulated to characterize the convertibility of resources for quantum information processing by a single function. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed, linking resource convertibility to the optimal performance of a variant of the quantum version of hypothesis testing. Central to this formulation was the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which aimed to characterize this optimal performance by a measure of quantum resources, the regularized relative entropy of resource. If proven valid, the generalized quantum Stein's lemma would lead to the second law for quantum resources, with the regularized relative entropy of resource taking the role of entropy in thermodynamics. However, in 2023, a logical gap was found in the original proof of this lemma, casting doubt on the possibility of such a formulation of the second law. In this work, we address this problem by developing alternative techniques to successfully prove the generalized quantum Stein's lemma under a smaller set of assumptions than the original analysis. Based on our proof, we reestablish and extend the second law of quantum resource theories, applicable to both static resources of quantum states and a fundamental class of dynamical resources represented by classical-quantum (CQ) channels. These results resolve the fundamental problem of bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</p>

            <p>The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Although one-way functions are well-established as the minimal primitive for classical cryptography, a minimal primitive for quantum cryptography is still unclear. Universal extrapolation, first considered by Impagliazzo and Levin (1990), is hard if and only if one-way functions exist. Towards better understanding minimal assumptions for quantum cryptography, we study the quantum analogues of the universal extrapolation task. Specifically, we put forth the classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation task, where we ask to extrapolate the rest of a bipartite pure state given the first register measured in the computational basis. We then use it as a key component to establish new connections in quantum cryptography: (a) quantum commitments exist if classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard; and (b) classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard if any of the following cryptographic primitives exists: quantum public-key cryptography (such as quantum money and signatures) with a classical public key or 2-message quantum key distribution protocols. For future work, we further generalize the extrapolation task and propose a fully quantum analogue. We show that it is hard if quantum commitments exist, and it is easy for quantum polynomial space.</p>

Here, we introduce a class of CV entanglement measures, among which we identify a nonconvex entanglement monotone -- the ratio negativity, which possesses a simple, scalable form that determines the exponential decay of optimal entanglement swapping on a chain of pure Gaussian states. This characterization opens avenues for leveraging statistical physics tools to analyze swapping-protocol-based CV QNs.</p>

            <p>Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers significant advantages in terms of high temporal and frequency resolutions and signal-to-noise ratio. Until now, the response-function (RF) formalism has been the prevalent theoretical description. In this study, we compare the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) method with the RF formalism in a three-level system with a constant control field. We obtain the signals from both approaches and compare their population dynamics and 2DCS. We propose the quasi-Green functions for the NHH method, which allows all dominant Liouville paths to be inferred. We further simulate the 2DCS of Rh(CO)$_2$C$_5$H$_7$O$_2$ (RDC) dissolved in hexane with the NHH method, which is in good agreement with the previous experiments. Although the NHH method overestimates relaxations, it provides all important paths by analytical solutions, which are different from the four paths used in the RF formalism. Our results demonstrate that the NHH method is more suitable than the RF formalism for investigating the systems including relaxation and control fields via the 2DCS.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era require algorithms that can generate shallower circuits feasible for today's quantum systems. This is particularly challenging for quantum chemistry applications due to the inherent complexity of molecular systems. Working with pharmaceutically relevant molecules containing sulfonyl fluoride ($SO_2F$) warheads used in targeted covalent drug development, we combine Hamiltonian terms truncation, Clifford Decomposition and Transformation (CDAT), and optimized transpilation techniques to achieve up to a 28.5-fold reduction in circuit depth when assuming all-to-all connectivity of quantum hardware. When employed on IBMQ's Heron architecture, we demonstrate up to a 15.5-fold reduction. Through these methods, we reduced circuit depths to 1330 gates for 8-qubit Hamiltonian dynamics simulations. Using middleware solutions for circuit decomposition, we successfully executed sub-circuits with depths up to 371 gates containing 216 2-qubit gates, representing one of the largest electronic structure Hamiltonian dynamics calculations implemented on current quantum hardware. The systematic circuit reduction approach shows promise for scaling to larger active spaces, while maintaining sufficient accuracy for molecular reactivity predictions using the Quantum-Centric Data-Driven R&D framework.

            <p>Current fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) architectures utilize several encoding techniques to enable reliable logical operations with restricted qubit connectivity. However, such logical operations demand additional memory overhead to ensure fault tolerance. Since the main obstacle to practical quantum computing is the limited qubit count, our primary mission is to design floorplans that can reduce memory overhead without compromising computational capability. Despite extensive efforts to explore FTQC architectures, even the current state-of-the-art floorplan strategy devotes 50% of memory space to this overhead, not to data storage, to ensure unit-time random access to all logical qubits. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture based on a novel floorplan strategy, Load/Store Quantum Computer Architecture (LSQCA), which can achieve almost 100% memory density. The idea behind our architecture is to separate all memory regions into small computational space called Computational Registers (CR) and space-efficient memory space called Scan-Access Memory (SAM). We define an instruction set for these abstract structures and provide concrete designs named point-SAM and line-SAM architectures. With this design, we can improve the memory density by allowing variable-latency memory access while concealing the latency with other bottlenecks. We also propose optimization techniques to exploit properties of quantum programs observed in our static analysis, such as access locality in memory reference timestamps. Our numerical results indicate that LSQCA successfully leverages this idea. In a resource-restricted situation, a specific benchmark shows that we can achieve about 90% memory density with 5% increase in the execution time compared to a conventional floorplan, which achieves at most 50% memory density for unit-time random access. Our design ensures broad quantum applicability.</p>

            <p>The limited qubit connectivity of quantum processors poses a significant challenge in deploying practical algorithms and logical gates, necessitating efficient qubit mapping and routing strategies. When implementing a gate that requires additional connectivity beyond the native connectivity, the qubit state must be moved to a nearby connected qubit to execute the desired gate locally. This is typically achieved using a series of SWAP gates creating a SWAP path. However, routing methods relying on SWAP gates often lead to increased circuit depth and gate count, motivating the need for alternative approaches. This work explores the potential of teleported gates to improve qubit routing efficiency, focusing on implementation within specific hardware topologies and benchmark quantum algorithms. We propose a routing method that is assisted by gate teleportation. It establishes additional connectivity using gate teleportation paths through available unused qubits, termed auxiliary qubits, within the topology. To optimize this approach, we have developed an algorithm to identify the best gate teleportation connections, considering their potential to reduce the depth of the circuit and address possible errors that may arise from the teleportation paths. Finally, we demonstrate depth reduction with gate teleportation-assisted routing in various benchmark algorithms, including case studies on the compilation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for heavy-hexagon topology used in IBM 127-qubit Eagle r3 processors. Our benchmark results show a 10-25 $\%$ depth reduction in the routing of selected algorithms compared to regular routing without using the teleported gate.</p>

            <p>The tight frames can be regarded as a particular case of POVMs (positive operator-valued measures describing generalized measurements), namely the case when all the operators are rank-one. Each orthonormal basis is a tight frame, and every tight frame, after the embedding into a higher-dimensional space, is the orthogonal projection of an orthonormal basis. There exist several POVM-based definitions of coherence, and they are well-investigated. Our aim is to identify properties specific to the particular case of tight frames, and to look for some applications. All the POVM-based definitions use a Naimark extension. The frame-dependent coherence can be regarded as a particular case of POVM-based coherence, but it can be defined directly, without to use a Naimark extension. Its definition is a direct generalization of the basis-dependent $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, and it offers a more accurate description because we can use a frame containing several orthogonal bases. A frame-invariant definition of coherence for qubits and multi-qubit systems is presented.</p>

            <p>The viability of adiabatic quantum computation depends on the slow evolution of the Hamiltonian. The adiabatic switching theorem provides an asymptotic series for error estimates in $1/T$, based on the lowest non-zero derivative of the Hamiltonian and its eigenvalues at the endpoints. Modifications at the endpoints in practical implementations can modify this scaling behavior, suggesting opportunities for error reduction by altering endpoint behavior while keeping intermediate evolution largely unchanged. Such modifications can significantly reduce errors for long evolution times, but they may also require exceedingly long timescales to reach the hyperadiabatic regime, limiting their practicality. This paper explores the transition between the adiabatic and hyperadiabatic regimes in simple low-dimensional Hamiltonians, highlighting the impact of modifications of the endpoints on approaching the asymptotic behavior described by the switching theorem.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasil Rokaj, Ilia Tutunnikov, H. R. Sadeghpour</p>
            <p>Recent advances in polaritonic chemistry suggest that chemical reactions can be controlled via collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in a cavity. In this fully analytical work, we demonstrate that the collective vibrations of a molecular ensemble under VSC execute a beating with a period inversely proportional to the collective vacuum Rabi splitting. Significantly, this collective beating is imprinted on the local dynamics and resonantly suppresses individual molecular vibrations when a fraction of molecules are vibrationally excited, as in activated complexes formed in chemical reactions. This emergent beating occurs on significantly longer time scales than the individual molecular vibration or the cavity field oscillation period, peaking at the cavity-molecule resonance, consistent with polaritonic chemistry experiments. The cavity mediates an energy exchange between excited and ground-state molecules, affecting the dynamics of the entire ensemble. These findings suggest that the dynamics in polaritonic chemical reactions may not be in full equilibrium. In the ultra-strong coupling regime, we find that the local vibrations are modified by the cavity even at short time scales. Our analytical model offers insights into how collective VSC can dampen local molecular vibrations at resonance, potentially altering chemical reactivity.</p>
