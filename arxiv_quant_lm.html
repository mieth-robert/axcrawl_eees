            <h2>Chiral quantum state circulation from photon lattice topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souvik Bandyopadhyay, Anushya Chandran, Philip JD Crowley</p>
            <p>Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</p>

            <h2>Robust Rydberg facilitation via rapid adiabatic passage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinghan Wang, Yupeng Wang, Qi-Yu Liang</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a robust implementation of Rydberg antiblockade based on rapid adiabatic passage. Although Rydberg antiblockade offers key opportunities in quantum information processing and sensing, its sensitivity to position disorder and parameter imperfections has posed a central roadblock. By adiabatically sweeping across the interaction-shifted resonance, our approach is unaffected by realistic levels of disorder and parameter variations. As a straightforward application case, we show that it naturally gives rise to avalanche excitation growth in both one- and two-dimensional arrays. This avalanche process yields high gain with exceptionally low background, making it promising for rare-event detection. These results establish a practical route to robust Rydberg antiblockade dynamics, paving the way for future experimental and technological applications.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking Quantum Simulation Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Calvin Ku, Yu-Cheng Chen, Alice Hu, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for fault-tolerant quantum computation, especially for electronic structure calculations of chemical systems. To accommodate the diverse characteristics of quantum chemical systems, numerous variants of QPE have been developed, each with distinct qubit and gate cost implications. In this paper, we quantify the impact of three key parameters on the overall quantum resource costs for the QPE algorithm: the choice between trotterization and qubitization, the use of molecular orbitals versus plane-wave basis-sets, and the selection of the fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme. From this, we establish clear performance trade-offs and delineate specific parameter regimes that minimize resource costs for relevant molecular systems. When performing phase estimation on large molecules in the fault-tolerant setting, we found the first-quantized qubitization circuit using the plane-wave basis to be the most efficient, with a gate cost scaling of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}([N^{4/3}M^{2/3}+N^{8/3}M^{1/3}]/\varepsilon)$ for a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals, which is the best known scaling to date. On the other hand, when only noisy intermediate-scale or near-term fault-tolerant systems are available, the phase estimation of small molecules can be performed with gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(M^{7}/\varepsilon^{2})$ via trotterization in the MO basis. Furthermore, we provide numerical estimations of qubit and T gate costs required to perform QPE for several real-world molecular systems under these different parameter choices.</p>

            <h2>Self-Sustained Oscillations of a Nonlinear Optomechanical System in the Low-Excitation Regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivangi Dhiman, K. Rubenbauer, T. Luschmann, A. Marx, A. Metelmann, H. Huebl</p>
            <p>Manifesting across all time, mass and length scales, nonlinearities lie at the core of numerous physical phenomena. Next-generation quantum applications, such as quantum sensing, require the combination of nonlinearity with non-classical correlations. This necessitates the search for an experimental platform which enables a nonlinear response at ultra-low excitation levels in a system with practical sensing potential and quantum compatibility. Here, we report the observation and theoretical modeling of nonlinear dynamics in a mechanical system driven at the single-excitation level. We achieve this using a cavity-optomechanical platform with large single-photon coupling rates and a nonlinear microwave resonator. Specifically, the large Kerr nonlinearity of our superconducting microwave circuit reduces the threshold for the observation of nonlinear dynamics by four orders of magnitude, making this regime experimentally accessible at the few-photon level. The parameter-based quantitative predicative power of the theoretical description underlines our deep understanding of the physics involved and that this device concept paves the way for experiments with non-classical microwave drive schemes.</p>

            <h2>Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\sim0.1\,$second Lifetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takaaki Takenaka, Takayuki Kubo, Imran Mahoob, Kosuke Mizuno, Hitoshi Inoue, Takayuki Saeki, Shiro Saito</p>
            <p>We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>The (PXP)$^2$ model: long-range quantum scars in optical cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Hosseinabadi, Riccardo J. Valencia-Tortora, Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Darrick E. Chang, Johannes Zeiher, Roderich Moessner, Jamir Marino</p>
            <p>Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and NÃ©el-ordered phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase, distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics.</p>

            <h2>BIFROST: A First-Principles Model of Polarization Mode Dispersion in Optical Fiber</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick R. Banner, Steven L. Rolston, Joseph W. Britton</p>
            <p>We present BIFROST, a first-principles model of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers. Unlike conventional models, BIFROST employs physically motivated representations of the PMD properties of fibers, allowing users to computationally investigate real-world fibers in ways that are connected to physical parameters such as environmental temperature and external stresses. Our model, implemented in an open-source Python module, incorporates birefringence from core geometry, material properties, environmental stress, and fiber spinning. We validate our model by examining commercial fiber specifications, fiber-paddle measurements, and published PMD statistics for deployed fiber links, and we showcase BIFROST's predictive power by considering wavelength-division-multiplexed PMD compensation schemes for polarization-encoded quantum networks. BIFROST's physical grounding enables investigations into such questions as the sensitivity of fiber sensors, the evaluation of PMD mitigation strategies in quantum networks, and many more applications across fiber technologies.</p>

            <h2>Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation from CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots in in-situ selected Laguerre-Gaussian modes</h2>

            <p>Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams for advanced quantum photonic applications.</p>

            <h2>Multimode Phonon-Polaritons in Lead-Halide Perovskites in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime</h2>

            <p>Phonons play a central role in fundamental solid-state phenomena, including superconductivity, Raman scattering, and symmetry-breaking phases. Harnessing phonons to control these effects and enable quantum technologies is therefore of great interest. However, most existing phonon control strategies rely on external driving fields or anharmonic interactions, limiting their applicability. Here, we realize multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling and theoretically show the modulation of phonon emission. This regime is realized by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to a nanoslot array functioning as a single-mode cavity. The small mode volume of the nanoslots enables high coupling strengths in the phonon-polariton system. We show theoretically that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective interaction between phonon modes, leading to superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium between distinct modes. Our findings are well described by a multimode Hopfield model. This work establishes a pathway for engineering phononic properties for light-harvesting and light-emitting technologies.</p>

            <h2>Intensity correlations in decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniil Trefilov, Xoel Sixto, VÃ­ctor Zapatero, Anqi Huang, Marcos Curty, Vadim Makarov</p>
            <p>The decoy-state method is a prominent approach to enhance the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that operate with weak coherent laser sources. Due to the limited transmissivity of single photons in optical fiber, current experimental decoy-state QKD setups increase their secret key rate by raising the repetition rate of the transmitter. However, this usually leads to correlations between subsequent optical pulses. This phenomenon leaks information about the encoding settings, including the intensities of the generated signals, which invalidates a basic premise of decoy-state QKD. Here we characterize intensity correlations between the emitted optical pulses in two industrial prototypes of decoy-state BB84 QKD systems and show that they significantly reduce the asymptotic key rate. In contrast to what has been conjectured, we experimentally confirm that the impact of higher-order correlations on the intensity of the generated signals can be much higher than that of nearest-neighbour correlations.</p>

            <h2>Generic Method for Integrating Lindblad Master Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayin Gu, Fan Zhang</p>
            <p>The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. Our method offers significant improvements in numerical efficiencies both in memory cost and computation time, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity of our method. The superiority of our method is benchmarked with detailed performance tests.</p>

            <h2>Diagnosing Quantum Many-body Chaos in Non-Hermitian Quantum Spin Chain via Krylov Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yijia Zhou, Wei Xia, Lin Li, Weibin Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the phase transitions from chaotic to nonchaotic dynamics in a quantum spin chain with a local non-Hermitian disorder, which can be realized with a Rydberg atom array setting. As the disorder strength increases, the emergence of nonchaotic dynamics is qualitatively captured through the suppressed growth of Krylov complexity, and quantitatively identified through the reciprocity breaking of Krylov space. We further find that the localization in Krylov space generates another transition in the weak disorder regime, suggesting a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results closely align with conventional methods, such as the entanglement entropy and complex level spacing statistics, and pave the way to explore non-Hermitian phase transitions using Krylov complexity and associated metrics.</p>

            <h2>Hyperspherical Analysis of Dimer-Dimer Scattering in One-Dimensional Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Wang, Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</p>

            <h2>Passive detection of Schwinger boson dynamics via a qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Petrides, Arpit Arora, Prineha Narang</p>
            <p>The quantum sensing landscape has been revolutionized by advanced technologies like superconducting circuits and qubit-based systems which have furthered the ability to probe and understand fundamental properties of quantum matter. Here, we propose an integrated photonic device where a transmon qubit capacitively couples to a microwave cross-resonator, and the setup is employed for sensing of time reversal broken order in materials. In this sensing scheme, the transmon qubit plays a dual role as both a control element and a passive detector, while the photonic cross-resonator serves as the host for the sample, enabling a contact-free spectroscopic method suitable for studying materials where reliable electrical contacts are challenging to obtain, e.g., in van der Waal 2D heterostructures. We show that by tuning the coupling strength and phase between the transmon and the cross-resonator, the system allows selective control over the interaction dynamics and leads to a highly sensitive detection method that can be compactly understood in terms of evolution of excited state population and quantum metric of the resonator-transmon hybrid state. This architecture has the potential to host a wide range of quantum phenomena that can be precisely encoded in the dynamics of the transmon qubit and, in this way, potentially allows access to elusive aspects of correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum reservoir computing using Jaynes-Cummings model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreetama Das, Gian Luca Giorgi, Roberta Zambrini</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC) using a hybrid qubit-boson system described by the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian and its dispersive limit (DJC). These models provide high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, making them powerful substrates for temporal information processing. We systematically benchmark both reservoirs through linear and nonlinear memory tasks, demonstrating that they exhibit an unusual superior nonlinear over linear memory capacity. We further test their predictive performance on the Mackey-Glass time series, a widely used benchmark for chaotic dynamics and show comparable forecasting ability. We also investigate how memory and prediction accuracy vary with reservoir parameters, and show the role of higher-order bosonic observables and time multiplexing in enhancing expressivity, even in minimal spin-boson configurations. Our results establish JC- and DJC-based reservoirs as versatile platforms for time-series processing and as elementary units that overcome the setting of equivalent qubit pairs and offer pathways towards tunable, high-performance quantum machine learning architectures.</p>

            <p>Photons are a ubiquitous carrier of quantum information: they are fast, suffer minimal decoherence, and do not require huge cryogenic facilities. Nevertheless, their intrinsically weak photon-photon interactions remain a key obstacle to scalable quantum computing. This review surveys hybrid photonic quantum computing, which exploits multiple photonic degrees of freedom to combine the complementary strengths of discrete and bosonic encodings, thereby significantly mitigating the challenge of weak photon-photon interactions. We first outline the basic principles of discrete-variable, native continuous-variable, and bosonic-encoding paradigms. We then summarise recent theoretical advances and state-of-the-art experimental demonstrations with particular emphasis on the hybrid approach. Its unique advantages, such as efficient generation of resource states and nearly ballistic (active-feedforward-free) operations, are highlighted alongside remaining technical challenges. To facilitate a clear comparison, we explicitly present the error thresholds and resource overheads required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Our work offers a focused overview that clarifies how the hybrid approach enables scalable and compatible architectures for quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions and Noise Robustness of Quantum Graph States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Numajiri, Shion Yamashika, Tomonori Tanizawa, Ryosuke Yoshii, Yuki Takeuchi, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>Graph states are entangled states that are essential for quantum information processing, including measurement-based quantum computation. As experimental advances enable the realization of large-scale graph states, efficient fidelity estimation methods are crucial for assessing their robustness against noise. However, calculations of exact fidelity become intractable for large systems due to the exponential growth in the number of stabilizers. In this work, we show that the fidelity between any ideal graph state and its noisy counterpart under IID Pauli noise can be mapped to the partition function of a classical spin system, enabling efficient computation via statistical mechanical techniques, including transfer matrix methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Using this approach, we analyze the fidelity for regular graph states under depolarizing noise and uncover the emergence of phase transitions in fidelity between the pure-state regime and the noise-dominated regime governed by both the connectivity (degree) and spatial dimensionality of the graph state. Specifically, in 2D, phase transitions occur only when the degree satisfies $d\ge 6$, while in 3D they already appear at $d\ge 5$. However, for graph states with excessively high degree, such as fully connected graphs, the phase transition disappears, suggesting that extreme connectivity suppresses critical behavior. These findings reveal that robustness of graph states against noise is determined by their connectivity and spatial dimensionality. Graph states with lower degree and/or dimensionality, which exhibit a smooth crossover rather than a sharp transition, demonstrate greater robustness, while highly connected or higher-dimensional graph states are more fragile. Extreme connectivity, as the fully connected graph state possesses, restores robustness.</p>

            <p>In quantum information and computation, a central challenge is to determine which quantum states can be transformed into one another under restricted sets of free operations. While many transformations are impossible directly, catalytic processes can enable otherwise forbidden conversions: an auxiliary quantum state (the catalyst) facilitates the transformation while remaining unchanged. In this work, we introduce flexible catalysis, a generalization in which the catalyst is allowed to transform into a different auxiliary state, provided it remains a valid catalyst. We show that this framework subsumes both standard catalytic and multicopy transformations, and we analyze its advantages across several classes of free operations. In particular, we prove that when the free operations are local unitaries or permutation matrices, flexible catalysis enables state extractions that are unattainable with standard catalysis alone.</p>

            <h2>A Contextual Seven-Valued Logic (\emph{SaptabhangÄ«naya}) for Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Partha Ghose</p>
            <p>The quantum measurement problem is often presented as a conflict between unitary evolution and non-unitary collapse. Drawing on Wittgenstein's later philosophy of language and Bohr's principle of complementarity, we argue that this conflict is a grammatical illusion arising from cross-context conflations. To address this, we introduce a contextual seven-valued logic modeled on the Jaina doctrine of \emph{saptabhangÄ«naya} (sevenfold predication). In one formulation, each proposition is assigned a triplet $(t,f,u)$ indicating its status as true, false, or unsayable within a given context, with paraconsistent rules blocking triviality. In another, contexts are explicitly formalized through quantified conditionals, aligning directly with Bohr's view that meaning derives from experimental arrangements. By comparing these two complementary approaches, we show how canonical paradoxes--including SchrÃ¶dinger's cat and Wigner's friend--dissolve once context is made explicit. The result is a flexible logical framework that reconciles Wittgensteinian conceptual therapy, Bohr's complementarity, and the Jaina pluralistic tradition, offering a coherent semantics for quantum discourse.</p>

            <p>Practical implementation of quantum error correction is currently limited by near-term quantum hardware. In contrast, quantum error mitigation has demonstrated strong promise for improving the performance of noisy quantum circuits without the requirement of full fault tolerance. In this work, we develop a hybrid error suppression protocol that integrates Pauli twirling, probabilistic error cancellation, and the $[[n, n-2, 2]]$ quantum error detecting code. In addition, to reduce overhead from error mitigation components of our method, we modify Pauli twirling by lowering the number of Pauli operators in the twirling set, and apply probabilistic error cancellation at the end of the encoded circuit to remove undetectable errors. Finally, we demonstrate our protocol on a non-Clifford variational quantum eigensolver circuit that estimates the ground state energy of $\rm H_2$ using both \texttt{qiskit} AerSimulator and the IBM quantum processor \texttt{ibm\_brussels}.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Z. Jiang, Z. L. Li, Y. J. Li</p>
            <p>A general spin-resolved momentum distribution of electron-positron pairs produced in strong external fields is derived by combining the covariant spin projection operator and the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism. The result shows that the spin-resolved and helicity-resolved momentum distributions given in previous literature are actually two special cases of it. For any spin-direction unit vector, numerical investigations demonstrate that when the $z$-component of the unit vector vanishes, the number density of produced spin-up and spin-down particles is equal, while their momentum distributions have some asymmetry. For a nonzero $z$-component of the unit vector, there is a difference of $1-3$ orders of magnitude in the number density of spin-up and spin-down particles induced by angular momentum transfer in multiphoton absorption. Moreover, as the electric field strength increases and/or the field frequency decreases, the asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down particle number density decreases rapidly. These results offer an approach to study general spin states in vacuum pair production, and enhance our understanding of angular momentum transfer from fields to matter in extreme environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Z. L. Li, Y. F. Chen, R. Z. Jiang, Y. J. Li</p>
            <p>The optimal chirped field for enhancing electron-positron (EP) pair production is explored using a quantum kinetic approach. First, the momentum spectrum and number density of EP pairs produced by Gaussian chirped fields are investigated. The results show that the momentum spectrum exhibits distinct interference patterns, while the number density grows monotonically with chirp parameters but oscillates with the carrier angular frequency. Moreover, the number density increases by four orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. The results are further compared with those from four other chirped fields: frequency-modulated, linear, quadratic, and sinusoidal chirp. The analysis reveals that the maximum number density for sinusoidally chirped fields is the highest, followed by Gaussian, frequency-modulated, quadratically, and linearly chirped fields. This ranking also applies to the maximum enhancement factors for these chirped fields. Notably, the number density for sinusoidally chirped fields improves nine orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. These results not only deepen our understanding of pair production in chirped fields but also provide significant optimization strategies for future vacuum pair production experiments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation approach to ultra-weak magnetic anisotropy in a frustrated spin-1/2 antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ki Won Jeong, Jae Yeon Seo, Sunghyun Lim, Jae Min Hong, Hyeon Jun Ryu, Jongseok Byeon, Kyungsun Moon, Nara Lee, Young Jai Choi</p>
            <p>The intrinsic equivalence between electron spin and qubit offers a natural foundation for quantum simulations of magnetic materials. However, incorporating magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), a key feature of real magnets, remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a quantum simulation framework for MCA in CuSb2O6, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating ferromagnetic chains arising from frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions in a nearly square lattice. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ spin network is modeled as a four-qubit square lattice, with four paired ancilla qubits introduced to encode angle-dependent MCA. This two-qubit representation per spin site resolves the limitation that squared Pauli operators yield only the identity, enabling MCA terms to be faithfully embedded into quantum circuits. Using the variational quantum eigensolver, we determine an exceptionally small easy-axis MCA constant, just 0.00022% of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, yet sufficient to drive a spin-flop transition with $90^{\circ}$ spin reorientation and strong angular variation in magnetic torque. Beyond this regime, the simulations uncover a half-saturated magnetic phase at ultra-high fields, stabilized by anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of resource-efficient quantum simulations of complex magnetic phenomena in real materials.</p>

            <h2>Comprehensive Analysis of VQC for Financial Fraud Detection: A Comparative Study of Quantum Encoding Techniques and Architectural Optimizations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fouad Mohammed Abbou, Mohamed Bouhadda, Lamiae Bouanane, Mouna Kettani, Farid Abdi, Abdelouahab Abid</p>
            <p>This paper presents a systematic comparative analysis of Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) configurations for financial fraud detection, encompassing three distinct quantum encoding techniques and comprehensive architectural variations. Through empirical evaluation across multiple entanglement patterns, circuit depths, and optimization strategies,quantum advantages in fraud classification accuracy are demonstrated, achieving up to 94.3 % accuracy with ZZ encoding schemes. The analysis reveals significant performance variations across entanglement topologies, with circular entanglement consistently outperforming linear (90.7) %) and full connectivity (92.0 %) patterns, achieving optimal performance at 93.3 % accuracy. The study introduces novel visualization methodologies for quantum circuit analysis and provides actionable deployment recommendations for practical quantum machine learning implementations. Notably, systematic entanglement pattern analysis shows that circular connectivity provides superior balance between expressivity and trainability while maintaining computational efficiency. These researches offer initial benchmarks for quantum enhanced fraud detection systems and propose potential benefits of quantum machine learning in financial security applications.</p>

            <h2>Error detection without post-selection in adaptive quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eli Chertkov, Andrew C. Potter, David Hayes, Michael Foss-Feig</p>
            <p>Current quantum computers are limited by errors, but have not yet achieved the scale required to benefit from active error correction in large computations. We show how simulations of open quantum systems can benefit from error detection. In particular, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to perform logical simulations of a non-equilibrium phase transition using the [[4,2,2]] code. Importantly, by converting detected errors into random resets, which are an intended part of the dissipative quantum dynamics being studied, we avoid any post-selection in our simulations, thereby eliminating the exponential cost typically associated with error detection. The encoded simulations perform near break-even with unencoded simulations at short times.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Winding and Emergent Coherence in Operator Growth Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishik Perugu, Bryce Kobrin, Michael O. Flynn, Thomas Scaffidi</p>
            <p>The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called $\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related concept of $\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and (ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$ (with $\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\alpha$ the growth rate), which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not saturate this bound, with $h = \lambda_L / 2\alpha <1$, the winding with Pauli size $\ell$ becomes $\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\ell^{1/h}$. We illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model.</p>

            <p>As present day quantum hardware is limited by various noise mechanisms, quantum advantage can only be reached in the near-term by designing noise-resilient quantum algorithms. In this work, we employ state-of-the-art quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to characterize the noise channels of IBM quantum processors under realistic runtime constraints. As our main application, we compare the Trotter time-evolution of three- and four-qubit wave functions to a compressed quantum circuit version of the same evolution operator. By analysing the spectral properties of the two process channels, we find that the compressed circuit systematically yields larger eigenvalue moduli, demonstrating better noise resilience.</p>

            <h2>Heisenberg Scaling in a Continuous-Wave Interferometer</h2>

            <p>Continuous-wave (CW) interferometry has stood at the frontier of precision measurement science since its inception, where it was used to search for the luminiferous ether, to the present day, where it forms the basis of interferometric gravitational-wave detection. Quantum theory predicts that this frontier can be expanded more rapidly by employing certain quantum resources, compared with the case of using only classical resources. In the quantum case, we can achieve ``Heisenberg scaling'', which manifests as a quadratic improvement over the best possible classical precision scaling. Although Heisenberg scaling has been demonstrated in pulsed operation, it has not been demonstrated for continuous operation. The challenge in doing so is two-fold: continuous measurements capable of Heisenberg scaling were previously unknown, and the requisite CW quantum states are fragile. Here we overcome these challenges and demonstrate the first CW interferometer exhibiting resource efficiency approaching Heisenberg scaling. Our scheme comprises a Mach-Zehnder interferometer illuminated with a pair of squeezed light sources, followed by a nonlinear estimator of the output homodyne record to estimate a differential phase modulation signal that drives the interferometer. We observe that this signal can be extracted with a precision that scales faster than what is allowed classically, and approaches the Heisenberg scaling limit.</p>

            <h2>Barnett Effect-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement in Magnomechanics with Optical Parametric Amplifier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noura Chabar, Shakir Ullah, Mohamed Amazioug</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement via the Barnett effect in a spinning ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Transformer-Based Neural Networks Backflow for Strongly Correlated Electronic Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Ma, Bowen Kan, Honghui Shang, Jinlong Yang</p>
            <p>Solving the electronic SchrÃ¶dinger equation for strongly correlated systems remains one of the grand challenges in quantum chemistry. Here we demonstrate that Transformer architectures can be adapted to capture the complex grammar of electronic correlations through neural network backflow. In this approach, electronic configurations are processed as token sequences, where attention layers learn non-local orbital correlations and token-specific neural networks map these contextual representations into backflowed orbitals. Application to strongly correlated iron-sulfur clusters validates our approach: for $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{~S}_2\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([2Fe-2S]) (30e,20o), the ground-state energy within chemical accuracy of DMRG while predicting magnetic exchange coupling constants closer to experimental values than all compared methods including DMRG, CCSD(T), and recent neural network approaches. For $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_4 \mathrm{S}_4\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([4Fe-4S]) (54e,36o), we match DMRG energies and accurately reproduce detailed spin-spin correlation patterns between all Fe centers. The approach scales favorably to large active spaces inaccessible to exact methods, with distributed VMC optimization enabling stable convergence. These results establish Transformer-based backflow as a powerful variational ansatz for strongly correlated electronic structure, achieving superior magnetic property predictions while maintaining chemical accuracy in total energies.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Acoustic Control of Resonance Fluorescence from a Strongly Driven Two-Level System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Zhan, Zixuan Wang, Richard P. Mirin, Kevin L. Silverman, Shuo Sun</p>
            <p>Resonance fluorescence from a single two-level system is a cornerstone of quantum optics. In the strong driving regime, its emission spectrum exhibits the iconic Mollow triplet, with each spectral component corresponding to a transition between distinct atom-photon dressed states. Here, we experimentally study the resonance fluorescence spectrum under a novel driving configuration in which a second gigahertz-frequency field drives the Rabi transition between two atom-photon dressed states. Our experiment is performed on a single semiconductor quantum dot strongly driven by a laser and a surface acoustic wave. We observe emission spectra that are significantly altered from the standard Mollow triplet, including the dynamical cancellation of resonance fluorescence at the central emission frequency. These spectra are explained by a theoretical model that incorporates the hybridization of the two-level system, the optical field, and the acoustic field. Motivated by this model, we experimentally validate the condition for optimal cooling of acoustic phonons in an emitter-optomechanical system. Our results offer new insights into the quantum interactions among single two-level systems, optical fields, and acoustic fields in the strong driving limit, with important applications in nonclassical acoustic state generation, quantum transduction, and quantum sensing of thermal motions.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition induced by magnon Kerr effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Qiang Zhang, Si-Yan Lin, Wei Feng, Yi-Hao Kang, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Recently, proposals for realizing a nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition (SQPT) have been put forward, based on either nonreciprocal interactions between two spin ensembles or the Sagnac-Fizeau shift in a spinning cavity. However, experimental implementation of such a nonreciprocal SQPT remains challenging. This motivates the search for new mechanisms capable of producing a nonreciprocal SQPT. Here, we propose an alternative approach to realize a nonreciprocal SQPT, induced by the magnon Kerr effect (MKE), in a cavity magnonic system, where magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are coupled to cavity photons. The Kerr coefficient $K$ is positive (negative), i.e., $K>0$ ($K<0$), when the bias magnetic field is aligned along the crystallographic axis [100] ([110]) of the YIG sphere. We show that the steady-state phase diagrams differ significantly for both cases with $K > 0$ and $K < 0$, which is the origin of the nonreciprocal SQPT. By further studying the steady-state magnon occupation and its fluctuations versus the parametric drive strength, we demonstrate that the SQPT becomes nonreciprocal, characterized by distinct critical thresholds for $K > 0$ and $K < 0$. Moreover, we introduce a bidirectional contrast ratio to quantify this nonreciprocal behavior. Our work provides a new mechanism for realizing the nonreciprocal SQPT, with potential applications in designing nonreciprocal quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous quantum error correction beyond break-even and its metrological application</h2>

            <p>The ability to extend the lifetime of a logical qubit beyond that of the best physical qubit available within the same system, i.e., the break-even point, is a prerequisite for building practical quantum computers. So far, this point has been exceeded through active quantum error correction (QEC) protocols, where a logical error is corrected by measuring its syndrome and then performing an adaptive correcting operation. Autonomous QEC (AQEC), without the need for such resource-consuming measurement-feedback control, has been demonstrated in several experiments, but none of which has unambiguously reached the break-even point. Here, we present an unambiguous demonstration of beyond-break-even AQEC in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where a photonic logical qubit encoded in a superconducting microwave cavity is protected against photon loss through autonomous error correction, enabled by engineered dissipation. Under the AQEC protection, the logical qubit achieves a lifetime surpassing that of the best physical qubit available in the system by 18\%. We further employ this AQEC protocol to enhance the precision for measuring a slight frequency shift, achieving a metrological gain of 6.3 dB over that using the most robust Fock-state superposition. These results illustrate that the demonstrated AQEC procedure not only represents a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computation but also offers advantages for building robust quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>In its beginnings, the physics of intense laser-matter interactions was the physics of multiphoton processes. The theory was reduced then to high-order perturbation theory, while treating matter and light in a quantum manner. With the advent of chirped pulse amplification developed by D. Strickland and G. Mourou, which enabled generation of ultra-intense, ultra-short, coherent laser pulses, the need for a quantum electrodynamics description of electromagnetic (EM) fields practically ceased to exist and lost relevance. Contemporary attoscience (AS), and more generally ultrafast laser physics, awarded the Nobel Prize in 2023 to P. Agostini, F. Krausz, and A. L'Huillier, commonly uses the classical description of EM fields while keeping a fully quantum description of matter. The progress and successes of AS in the last 40 years have been spectacular, with an enormous amount of fascinating investigations in basic research and technology. Yet a central question remains: can ultrafast laser physics continue to advance without reintroducing quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics into its description of light-matter interactions?

            <p>A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state, and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JoÃ£o Pedro MendonÃ§a, Krzysztof Jachymski, Yao Wang</p>
            <p>The superradiant phenomenon, usually described by the Dicke model, is a hallmark of strong light-matter interaction. We explore how matter-matter interactions influence this phenomenon by performing ground-state simulations of Dicke-like models with both isotropic and anisotropic spin couplings. We find that Ising-type interactions produce two qualitatively distinct phase boundaries, one of which gives rise to an antiferromagnetic-normal phase connected to the superradiant regime via a first-order phase transition. Under anisotropic couplings, we uncover a strongly correlated phase where in-plane spin order coexists with superradiance, exhibiting sublinear scaling of the photon occupation per site and power-law decay of spin correlations. Furthermore, superradiance can be strengthened by tuning either isotropic or anisotropic interactions, highlighting the role of intrinsic many-body correlations in shaping light-matter quantum phases.</p>

            <p>No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</p>

            <p>The intersection of quantum computing and quantum chemistry represents a promising frontier for achieving quantum utility in domains of both scientific and societal relevance. Owing to the exponential growth of classical resource requirements for simulating quantum systems, quantum chemistry has long been recognized as a natural candidate for quantum computation. This perspective focuses on identifying scientifically meaningful use cases where early fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are considered to be equipped with approximately 25--100 logical qubits, could deliver tangible impact. While recent advances in classical computing have pushed the boundaries of tractable simulations to unprecedented scales, this logical-qubit regime represents the first window where quantum devices can pursue qualitatively distinct strategies, such as polynomial-scaling phase estimation, direct simulation of quantum dynamics, and active-space embedding, that remain challenging for classical solvers, for instance, multireference charge-transfer and conical-intersection states central to photochemistry and materials design. We highlight near-term opportunities in algorithm and software design, discuss representative chemical problems suited for quantum acceleration, and propose strategic roadmaps and collaborative pathways for advancing practical quantum utility in quantum chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Simultaneous Quantization and Reduction of Constrained Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianhao M. Yang</p>
            <p>We present a novel framework for quantizing constrained quantum systems in which the processes of quantization and constraint enforcement are performed simultaneously. The approach is based on an extension of the stationary action principle, incorporating an information-theoretic term arising from vacuum fluctuations. Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange multipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum dynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction. We demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system with vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac quantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global translational invariance, where all three methods agree. These results show that the proposed framework generalizes standard quantization schemes and provides a consistent treatment of systems with constraints that cannot be expressed as linear operators acting on the wave function. In addition to a unified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism also offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising from vacuum fluctuations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Abu-Nada, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>We present a \emph{novel} and scalable supervised machine learning framework to predict open-quantum system dynamics and detect non-Markovian memory using only local ancilla measurements. A system qubit is coherently coupled to an ancilla via a symmetric XY Hamiltonian; the ancilla interacts with a noisy environment and is the only qubit we measure. A feedforward neural network, trained on short sliding windows of supplementary data from the past, forecasts the observable system $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ without state tomography or knowledge of the bath. To quantify memory, we introduce a normalized revival-based metric that counts upward 'turn-backs' in \emph{predicted} $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ and reports the fraction of evaluated samples that exceeds a small threshold. This bounded score provides an interpretable, model-independent indicator of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate the method on two representative noise channels, non-unital amplitude damping and unital dephasing from random telegraph noise (RTN). Under matched conditions, the model accurately reproduces the dynamics and flags memory effects, with RTN exhibiting a larger normalized revival score than amplitude damping. Overall, the approach is experimentally realistic and readily extensible, enabling real-time, interpretable non-Markovian diagnostics from accessible local measurements.</p>

            <h2>Cost-aware Photonic Graph State Generation: A Graphical Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sobhan Ghanbari, Hoi-Kwong Lo</p>
            <p>Photonic graph states are essential resources for quantum computation and communication. Deterministic emitter-based generation of graph states overcomes the scalability issues of probabilistic approaches, but their experimental realization is constrained by technological demands, often expressed by the number of two-qubit gates and the depth and/or width of the quantum circuits used to model the generation process. We introduce a cost-aware framework for the generation of photonic graph states of arbitrary size and shape, built on a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions and a universal set of elementary graph operations that govern the evolution of the state toward the target. Within this framework, we develop Graph Builder, a deterministic generation algorithm that achieves substantial reductions (up to an order of magnitude) in two-qubit gate usage for both random and structured graphs, compared with alternative approaches. The algorithm uses the minimum number of emitters possible for a fixed emission sequence, while also supporting the use of extra emitters for controlled trade-offs between emitter count and other cost metrics. Moreover, by systematically identifying the degrees of freedom at each stage of the generation process, this framework fully characterizes the optimization landscape, enabling analytic, heuristic, or exhaustive strategies for further cost reductions. Our approach provides a general and versatile tool for designing and optimizing emitter-based photonic graph state generation protocols, essential for scalable and resource-efficient photonic quantum information processing.</p>

Atomic defects in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exciting prospects for quantum sensing, with spatial resolution reaching 1 nm demonstrated using scanning probe techniques.

Here we report room-temperature quantum entanglement between an optically addressable electron spin and a strongly coupled $^{13}$C nuclear spin in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We extend the electron spin coherence to 38 $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling, and create maximally entangled Bell states with a fidelity up to 0.89. We further use the nuclear spin as a long-lived quantum memory to enhance AC magnetic field sensing via correlation spectroscopy. These results establish entangled spin qubits in hBN as a robust platform for advanced quantum technologies based on 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Mode Selection in Quantum Nonlinear Optics Using Optical Resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen</p>
            <p>Nonlinear optics underpins quantum photonics by enabling the generation and control of quantum states of light. We present new applications of optical resonators as mode selectors in nonlinear processes. First, we show that cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion can generate spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs with improved decorrelation and wavelength flexibility. Second, we demonstrate that a cavity-assisted sum-frequency generation process realizes a quantum pulse gate with high-resolution temporal-mode selectivity and precise spectral control. Our theoretical framework provides a general methodology for analyzing cavity-enhanced nonlinear processes and highlights the versatility of optical resonators as powerful tools for engineering quantum light.</p>

            <h2>Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Gen Li, Rong-Can Yang, Wei Xiong, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</p>

            <p>Hereby, we study the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons at telecom C-band by biexciton-exciton cascade from non-resonantly excited epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and shortening the radiative lifetimes.</p>

            <h2>Composite nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates with optimization on superconducting circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Yun Ding, Wan-Fang Liu, Li-Hua Zhang, Jian Zhou, Zheng-Yuan Xue</p>
            <p>Due to its fast and robust characteristics, nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation with various optimized techniques has received much attention. However, these strategies either require precise pulse control or can only mitigate partial systematic errors, hindering their experimental development. Here, we propose a scheme for optimized composite nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (OCNGQGs), which can further enhance the gate performance of the composite nonadiabatic geometric scheme. Specifically, by optimizing the path parameter, our scheme effectively resists systematic errors in both directions, i.e., Rabi frequency and detuning errors, while preserving the flexibility of pulse shapes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our scheme offers superior gate robustness against these two types of errors compared to conventional schemes. Additionally, we propose to implement our scheme on superconducting transmon qubits, where the numerical results show the robustness of universal gates remaining evident within current technology. Therefore, our proposal provides a promising approach to achieve robust quantum gates for future scalable quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Decoding Problem : Tight Achievability Bounds and Application to Regev's Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agathe Blanvillain, AndrÃ© Chailloux, Jean-Pierre Tillich</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum decoding problem. It consists in recovering a codeword given a superposition of noisy versions of this codeword. By measuring the superposition, we get back to the classical decoding problem. It appears for the first time in Chen, Liu and Zhandry's work showing a quantum advantage for the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem for the $l_\infty$ norm. In a recent paper, Chailloux and Tillich proved that when we have a noise following a Bernoulli distribution, the quantum decoding problem can be solved in polynomial time and is therefore easier than classical decoding for which the best known algorithms have an exponential complexity. They also give an information theoretic limit for the code rate at which this problem can be solved which turns out to be above the Shannon limit. In this paper, we generalize the last result to all memoryless noise models. We also show similar results in the rank metric case which corresponds to a noise model which is not memoryless. We analyze the Pretty Good Measurement, from which we derive an information theoretic limit for this problem. By using the algorithm for the quantum decoding problem together with Regev's reduction, we derive a quantum algorithm sampling codewords from the dual code according to a probability distribution which is the dual of the original noise. It turns out that at the information theoretic limit, we get the most likely nonzero codeword of the dual code. When the distribution is a decreasing function of the weight, we find minimal nonzero codewords. Note that Regev's reduction used together with classical decoding is much less satisfying since it is not able to output those minimum weight codewords.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahidur Rezwan Ratul</p>
            <p>We study Semi-Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD) with a focus on finite-size security bounds, developed through three complementary perspectives. (i) Spectral disturbance: wrong-basis LÃ¼ders updates produce closed-form spectra and purity loss, which serve as basis-independent indicators of disturbance. (ii) Operator-theoretic reduction: in Z/Z-sifted rounds, intercept-resend attacks can be represented as an effective depolarizing channel, characterized by a fidelity-QBER relation. (iii) Entropic trade-offs: Maassen-Uffink and memory-assisted uncertainty relations certify security through X tests and reflection rounds, even when the sifted QBER is low. The exposition provides step-by-step derivations supported by physically interpretable figures, and the framework concludes with finite-size estimates based on concentration inequalities that are suited for practical parameter estimation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the apparent thermality of Hawking radiation in the semi-classical limit of quantum black holes using the mean-field limit of a chiral spin-chain simulator, which models fermions propagating on a black hole space-time in the continuum. In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.</p>

            <p>We study the conditions required to distinguish laser-induced nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in vacuum from competing signals due to interactions of laser pulses with ionized residual gas. The latter is inevitably present in vacuum chambers where experiments are performed because the vacuum is never perfect and there is always some residual pressure. The rarefied gas contribution is modeled statistically using the 1D-1V Vlasov-Maxwell system, while vacuum nonlinearities are described within the weak-field expansion of the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. In both cases, photon spectra from wave-mixing processes are evaluated by solving numerically the resulting partial differential equations using a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We consider short pulses in co- and counter-propagating configurations, allowing us to identify the laser intensities and vacuum pressures for which the vacuum signal dominates. These results provide quantitative guidance for future all-optical experiments aiming to detect light-by-light scattering in vacuum.</p>

            <p>We study a generalization of `Yukawa models' in which Majorana fermions, interacting via all-to-all random couplings as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, are parametrically coupled to disordered bosonic degrees of freedom described by a quantum $p-$spin model. The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.</p>

            <p>We investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of amassless electron in graphene in a two-dimensional noncommutative (NC) plane under a constant background magnetic field. To address the issue of gauge invariance, we employ an effective massless NC Dirac field theory, incorporating the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map alongside the Moyal star product. Using this framework, we derive a manifestly gauge-invariant Hamiltonian for a massless Dirac particle, which serves as the basis for studying the relativistic Landau problem in graphene in NC space. Specifically, we analyze the motion of a relativistic electron in monolayer graphene within this background field and compute the energy spectrum of the NC Landau system. The NC-modified energy levels are then used to explore the system's thermodynamic response. Notably, in the low-temperature limit, spatial noncommutativity leads to a spontaneous magnetization-a distinct signature of NC geometry in relativistic condensed matter systems like graphene.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we examine the holographic complexity of a theory of Einstein-Maxwell with a non-minimal coupling $R^2 F_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu} $ term via complexity=anything. We introduce a perturbative black brane solution in AdS spacetime up to the first order of the non-minimal coupling. Because the model exhibits the resistivity proportional to the temperature, it could describe strange metals. The complexity of the solution could be characterized by three quantities: the conserved charge, the non-minimal coupling and the generalized term in the complexity. The generalized term is chosen to be $C^2$, the Weyl squared tensor, $R^2F^2$ and $F^2$. The physical interpretation of the three quantities has been provided where the generalized term is interpreted as a bulk penalty factor, the non-minimal coupling and the conserved charge as an effective scrambling time of the dual theory which contains the choice of the generalization parameter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wirawat Kokaew, Thiparat Chotibut, Areeya Chantasri</p>
            <p>Finding controls for open quantum systems needs to take into account effects from unwanted environmental noise. Since actual realizations or states of the noise are typically unknown, the usual treatment for the quantum system's decoherence dynamics is via the so-called Lindblad master equation, which in essence describes an average evolution (mean path) of the system's state affected by the unknown noise. We here consider an alternative view of a noise-affected open quantum system, where the average dynamics can be unravelled into hypothetical noisy quantum trajectories, and propose a control strategy for the state-preparation problem based on the likelihood of noise occurrence. We formulate a stochastic path integral for noise variables whose extremum yields control functions associated with a most-likely noise to achieve target states. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to a qubit-state preparation under dephasing noise and analytically solve for controlled Rabi drives for arbitrary target states. Since the method is constructed based on the probability of noise, we also introduce a fidelity success rate as a measure of the state preparation. We benchmark against the mean-path approaches, e.g., GRAPE and CRAB controls, using both average fidelity and a success-rate metric. While standard mean-path controls maximize average fidelity, most-likely controls achieve higher success rates, especially at strong dephasing.</p>

            <p>This work presents a new approach for simulating the HHL linear systems of equations solver algorithm with tensor networks. First, a novel HHL in the qudits formalism, the generalization of qubits, is developed, and then its operations are transformed into an equivalent classical HHL, taking advantage of the non-unitary operations that they can apply. The main novelty of this proposal is to perform a classical simulation of the HHL as efficiently as possible to benchmark the algorithm steps according to its input parameters and the input matrix. The algorithm is applied to three classical simple simulation problems, comparing it with an exact inversion algorithm, and its performance is compared against an implementation of the original HHL simulated in the Qiskit framework, providing both codes. It is also applied to study the sensitivity of the HHL algorithm with respect to its hyperparameter values, reporting the existence of saturation points and maximal performance values. The results show that this approach can achieve a promising performance in computational efficiency to simulate the HHL process without quantum noise, providing a higher bound for its performance.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii</p>
            <p>The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</p>

            <p>Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. Wave matrix Lindbladization (WML) similarly processes multiple copies of a program state $\psi_L$ in order to realize a Lindbladian evolution. Both algorithms are prototypical sample-based quantum algorithms and can be used for various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum principal component analysis, Hamiltonian simulation, and Lindbladian simulation. In this work, we present detailed sample complexity analyses for DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, as well as for WML and sample-based Lindbladian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$ for evolution time $t$ and imprecision level $\varepsilon$ quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor. Additionally, we prove that the sample complexity of WML is no larger than $3t^2d^2/\varepsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space on which the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially, and we prove a lower bound of $10^{-4} t^2/\varepsilon$ on the sample complexity of sample-based Lindbladian simulation. These results prove that WML is optimal for sample-based Lindbladian simulation whenever the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially on a constant-sized system. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] and the WML sample complexity analysis in [Patel and Wilde, Open Systems \& Information Dynamics 30, 2350010 (2023)] appear to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here.</p>

This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic SchrÃ¶dinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p>Developing a dark matter detector with wide mass tunability is an immensely desirable property, yet it is challenging due to maintaining strong sensitivity. Resonant cavities for dark matter detection have traditionally employed mechanical tuning, moving parts around to change electromagnetic boundary conditions. However, these cavities have proven challenging to operate in sub-Kelvin cryogenic environments due to differential thermal contraction, low heat capacities, and low thermal conductivities. Instead, we develop an electronically tunable cavity architecture by coupling a superconducting 3D microwave cavity with a DC flux tunable SQUID. With a flux delivery system engineered to maintain high coherence in the cavity, we perform a hidden-photon dark matter search below the quantum-limited threshold. A microwave photon counting technique is employed through repeated quantum non-demolition measurements using a transmon qubit. With this device, we perform a hidden-photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to ${\varepsilon}< 8.2\times 10^{-15}$ in a tunable band from 5.672 GHz to 5.694 GHz. By coupling multimode tunable cavities to the transmon, wider hidden-photon searching ranges are possible.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Speed Limit and Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation under Feedback Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayato Yunoki, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Fundamental trade-off relations, such as quantum speed limit and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, describe the performance limits of quantum systems by imposing that improvements in speed or precision necessitate a substantial thermodynamic cost. Quantum feedback control, which is a pivotal technique for manipulating quantum dynamics based on measurement outcomes, is widely employed to enhance system performance. Nevertheless, its impact on these fundamental bounds remains an open question. This work elucidates this influence by establishing a theoretical framework for quantum speed limit and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation under a paradigmatic Markovian feedback protocol. We derive general inequalities incorporating the effects of feedback control on speed and precision. Through numerical simulations on a simple two-level system and quantum error correction, a key application of quantum feedback control, we validate our derived bounds and demonstrate that feedback control can indeed improve both speed and precision beyond those achievable limits in uncontrolled systems. Next, to elucidate the mechanism behind these improvements and the qualitative difference from uncontrolled dynamics, we analyze the governing thermodynamic costs, which are the fundamental quantities that constrain speed and precision, within a simple model. Our analysis reveals that feedback can improve the time scaling order of these costs. This modification of the dynamical scaling is the origin of the qualitative performance gain, signifying that the feedback-induced improvements of performance are not merely quantitative but represent a fundamental shift. Consequently, our work offers a comprehensive understanding of how feedback control impacts the fundamental limits on the speed and precision of quantum systems, providing crucial insights for designing high-performance quantum technologies.</p>

We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</p>

            <p>We report a new type of vulnerability in practical implementations of quantum key distribution systems. We show that it is possible to increase the pulse energy of a source laser diode not only by injection-locking it by external light near its emission wavelength of 1550 nm, but also by optically pumping it at a much shorter wavelength. We demonstrate 10% increase in pulse energy when exposing the laser diode to 1310-nm, 1.6-mW cw laser light via its fiber pigtail. This may allow an eavesdropper to steal the secret key. A possible countermeasure is to install broadband optical filters and isolators at the source's output and characterise them during the security certification.</p>

            <h2>No Practical Quantum Broadcasting: Even Virtually</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunlong Xiao, Xiangjing Liu, Zhenhuan Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum information cannot be broadcast -- an intrinsic limitation imposed by quantum mechanics. However, recent advances in virtual operations offer new insights into the no-broadcasting theorem. Here, we focus on the practical utility and introduce sample efficiency as a fundamental constraint, requiring any practical broadcasting protocol perform no worse than the naÃ¯ve approach of direct preparation and distribution. We prove that no linear process -- whether quantum or beyond -- can simultaneously uphold sample efficiency, unitary covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency. This leads to a no-practical-broadcasting theorem, which places strict limits on the practical distribution of quantum information. By applying Schur-Weyl duality, we establish the uniqueness of the canonical 1-to-$N$ virtual broadcasting map that satisfies the latter three conditions, provide its construction, and determine its sample complexity through semidefinite programming. Finally, we explore the interplay between virtual broadcasting and a quantum spacetime framework, known as the pseudo-density operator, showing that their correspondence holds only in the 1-to-2 case, underscoring the fundamental asymmetry between spatial and temporal statistics in the quantum world.</p>

            <h2>Dynamically near-stable two-mode squeezing in optomechanical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-fan Qi</p>
            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme within a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, wherein a mechanical resonator is coupled to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the open-quantum-system framework. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unstable system dynamics. Moreover, the squeezing level can surpass the maximum achievable under stable system conditions. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Ren, Andrew Hallam, Lei Ying, Zlatko PapiÄ</p>
            <p>Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Distillation of multipartite entangled states for arbitrary subsets of parties in noisy quantum networks of increasing size</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aitor Balmaseda, Julio I. de Vicente</p>
            <p>Quantum network states are multipartite states built from distributing pairwise entanglement among parties and underpin the paradigm of quantum networks for quantum information processing. In this work we introduce the problem of partial distillability in noisy quantum networks. This corresponds to the possibility of distilling by local operations and classical communication an arbitrary pure state for an arbitrary subset of parties starting from a single copy of a quantum network state of an increasing number of parties that share noisy (i.e. mixed) bipartite entangled states. Here, distillation means that the target state is obtained with fidelity as close to 1 as desired as the size of the network increases when the pairwise entangled links support a constant amount of noise. While we prove an obstruction to multipartite distillation protocols after teleportation with channels with constant noise, we show that partial distillability is indeed possible if certain well-established graph-theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity in the network grow fast enough with its size. We give necessary as well as sufficient conditions for partial distillability in terms of these parameters and we moreover provide explicit constructions of networks with partial distillability and a relatively slow connectivity growth.</p>

            <p>The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation.</p>

            <p>Complex quantum networks are not only hard to establish, but also difficult to simulate due to the exponentially growing state space and noise-induced imperfections. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that leverage quantum computers and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices as simulators for quantum networks, including noisy quantum devices, channels, and protocols. Rather than considering noise as an undesired property that needs to be mitigated, we demonstrate how imperfections in quantum hardware can be utilized to simulate real-world communication devices under realistic conditions beyond classical simulation capabilities. Our approach allows NISQ devices with modest noise to simulate devices with more significant imperfections enabling large-scale, detailed simulations of quantum networks, where exact error models can be treated. It also improves over direct implementation and benchmarking of real networks, as waiting times for information transmission, locality, and memory restrictions do not apply. This framework can offer advantages in flexibility, scalability, and precision, demonstrating that NISQ devices can serve as natural testbeds for complex quantum networks, and paving the way for more efficient quantum network simulations.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence, encoded in the off-diagonal elements of a system's density matrix, is a key resource in quantum thermodynamics, fundamentally limiting the maximum extractable work known as ergotropy. While previous experiments have isolated coherence-related contributions to work extraction, it remains unclear how coherence can be harnessed in a controllable and energy-efficient manner. Here, we experimentally investigate the role of initial-state coherence in work extraction from a superconducting transmon qubit. By preparing a variety of pure states and implementing three complementary extraction protocols, we reveal how coherence governs the partitioning of ergotropy. We find that the choice of initial state depends on the dominant decoherence channel-energy relaxation or dephasing. By further accounting for thermodynamic costs, we identify optimal initial states that maximize the efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the initial-state design provides a scalable approach to coherence control and advances the development of efficient quantum thermodynamic devices.</p>

            <p>Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</p>

            <p>We study the entanglement structure of tripartite stabilizer states on $N$ qudits of dimension $D$, distributed across parties $A$, $B$, and $C$, under arbitrary local unitaries. Prior work by Bravyi et al. and Looi et al. showed that qubit and squarefree qudit stabilizer states can be transformed via local Clifford unitaries into tensor products of GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0504208, arXiv:1107.1761]. We generalize this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits. Our algorithm leverages subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and applies to quantum protocols requiring efficient entanglement distribution.</p>

            <p>The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes--anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that a four-wave mixing-like correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation and completely characterizes the non-resonant SaS photon pair production. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</p>

            <p>We address the challenge of multi-target quantum optimization, where the objective is to simultaneously optimize multiple cost functions defined over the same quantum search space. To accelerate optimization and reduce quantum resource usage, we investigate a range of strategies that enable knowledge transfer between related tasks. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage framework consisting of a training phase where solutions are progressively shared across tasks and an inference phase, where unoptimized targets are initialized based on prior optimized ones. We propose and evaluate several methods, including warm-start initialization, parameter estimation via first-order Taylor expansion, hierarchical clustering with D-level trees, and deep learning-based transfer. Our experimental results, using parameterized quantum circuits implemented with PennyLane, demonstrate that transfer techniques significantly reduce the number of required iterations while maintaining an acceptable cost value. These findings highlight the promise of multi-target generalization in quantum optimization pipelines and provide a foundation for scalable multi-target quantum optimization.</p>

            <p>In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally connected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and arrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with a QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the scaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with the graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size growth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential advantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at least polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm considered relative to an efficient classical linear solver. Within the scope of our analyses, we observe that only 4% of the 50 considered graph families offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20% of the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we observe and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only fare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm but also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial advantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given the limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical studies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families into one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may face even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Pesah, Austin K. Daniel, Ilan Tzitrin, Michael Vasmer</p>
            <p>Recent advances in quantum error-correction (QEC) have shown that it is often beneficial to understand fault-tolerance as a dynamical process, a circuit with redundant measurements that help correct errors, rather than as a static code equipped with a syndrome extraction circuit. Spacetime codes have emerged as a natural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while leveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on chain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations between them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding problems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence of two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain complexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits, fault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this framework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer codes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be transformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant properties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the underlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex constructions. Our method enables the construction of cluster states from non-CSS, subsystem, and Floquet codes, as well as from logical Clifford operations on a given code.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms, ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.</p>

We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</p>

            <p>The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</p>

            <p>Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</p>

            <p>It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has the desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors from several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation remain small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p>We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.</p>

            <p>Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum spacetime from constraints: wave equations and fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Favalli</p>
            <p>In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the SchrÃ¶dinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.</p>

            <h2>Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Charamis, Manas Kulkarni, Jorge Kurchan, Laura Foini</p>
            <p>The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Zhang, Mengxin Zheng, Qian Lou, Hui Min Leung, Fan Chen</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, whose performance is highly sensitive to parameter initialization. Although recent machine learning-based initialization methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are typically restricted to a single domain, contain only a few hundred instances, and lack complete coverage of Hamiltonians, ansatz circuits, and optimization trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization. VQEzy spans three major domains and seven representative tasks, comprising 12,110 instances with full VQE specifications and complete optimization trajectories. The dataset is available online, and will be continuously refined and expanded to support future research in VQE optimization.</p>

            <h2>Dimer-driven multiple reentrant localization with composite potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Jie Chang, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Ikeda, Yaron Oz</p>
            <p>We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</p>

            <h2>Thermal reconstruction of chaotic quantum many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shozab Qasim, Jason Pollack</p>
            <p>Thermal states are thermal with respect to a fixed Hamiltonian. How much information about this Hamiltonian can we ``bootstrap'' from the subsystems of a thermal state? We attack the problem by positioning it as a subspecies of the quantum marginal problem. In states that obey the quantum Markov property, the Petz recovery map captures the knowledge of the larger system inherent in a subsystem. We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction breaks down at low temperatures.</p>

            <p>We ask how quantum correlations can be distributed among many subsystems. To address this, we define entanglement sharing schemes (ESS) where certain pairs of subsystems allow entanglement to be recovered via local operations, while other pairs must not. ESS schemes come in two variants, one where the partner system with which entanglement should be prepared is known, and one where it is not. In the case of known partners, we fully characterize the access structures realizable for ESS when using stabilizer states, and construct efficient schemes for threshold access structures, and give a conjecture for the access structures realizable with general states. In the unknown partner case, we again give a complete characterization in the stabilizer setting, additionally give a complete characterization of the case where there are no restrictions on unauthorized pairs, and we prove a set of necessary conditions on general schemes which we conjecture are also sufficient. Finally, we give an application of the theory of entanglement sharing to resolve an open problem related to the distribution of entanglement in response to time-sensitive requests in quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and Control of Two Coupled Quantum Oscillators: An Analytical Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Abu-Nada, Lian-Ao Wu</p>
            <p>We analyze two coupled quantum oscillators in a common Lorentzian environment and control them by detuning (temporarily shifting) their frequencies. The reduced dynamics are solved exactly, without Born or Markov approximations, by propagating each detuning segment in closed form. We study two control schedules: regular detuning, with perfectly periodic on and off pulses of fixed period, width, and amplitude; and irregular detuning, with the same on/off structure but cycle-to-cycle jitter in period, width, and amplitude. Our main observable is the average excitation number (AEN) of each mode. Detuning moves the system away from the bath's spectral peak, suppressing decoherence and damping non-Markovian revivals; in effectively Markovian baths the benefit is small. We quantify performance with a simple time-domain suppression factor. Larger detuning amplitudes and higher duty cycles yield stronger protection. Irregular control is slightly weaker at low duty cycle but becomes comparable to regular control as the duty cycle approaches one. These results give practical design rules linking detuning, duty cycle, and bath width, and provide an exact benchmark for controlled non-Markovian dynamics.</p>

            <h2>From VQE To SQD: Modern Quantum Algorithms For The Electronic Structure Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdelmouheymen Rabah Khamadja, Mohamed Taha Rouabah</p>
            <p>This thesis investigates sampling-based quantum algorithms for electronic ground state energy estimation, focusing on Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) and Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) as near-term alternatives to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Unlike VQE, which suffers from barren plateaus and high measurement costs, these methods avoid variational optimization by sampling Slater determinants from quantum hardware and performing diagonalization classically. The central contribution is the first analytical expression for the sampling bottleneck: the determinant-discovery step is mapped to the classical coupon-collector problem, yielding both an exact formula and a scalable lower-bound estimator for the number of measurements required to recover all determinants contributing to the ground state. Previous work only relied on numerical sampling and estimation. The analysis is validated through simulations, hardware-calibrated noisy studies, and execution on IBM's 127-qubit IBM Brisbane processor, demonstrating the dominant role of sampling efficiency in the near-term feasibility of QSCI and SQD.

            <p>Multi-photon correlations from quantum emitters coupled to vibrational environments lie beyond the reach of standard tools such as the quantum regression theorem (QRT). Here, we introduce a Markovian framework for computing frequency-resolved $N$-photon correlation functions that overcomes this limitation. Applying our approach to a driven semiconductor quantum dot provides a tractable description of phonon effects on fluorescence beyond the single-photon spectrum. Our method accurately captures the emergence of the phonon sideband, missed by conventional QRT treatments, and reveals rich phonon-induced structure in the filtered two-photon spectrum. Strikingly, we find that photons emitted via the phonon sideband inherit second-order coherence properties of the Mollow triplet.</p>

            <p>We study the limitations on observing transient amplification in atomic systems exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and evaluate the limits of optical Bloch equation (OBE) models. Using propagation-based Maxwell-Bloch simulations, we show that single-atom, spatially uniform OBE treatments overestimate gain by neglecting propagation dynamics. In two-level systems, this yields incorrect transmission, while in three-level systems, it predicts unrealistically large amplification. Furthermore, we show that Doppler averaging in warm vapor suppresses oscillatory ringing and the maximum achievable gain. Our results explain discrepancies between OBE predictions and experimental observations, and establish practical limits on transient gain in cold and thermally broadened EIT media.</p>

            <p>We describe a deterministic and experimentally feasible protocol for generating entangled pairs of ultracold neutral atoms through controlled dissociation of diatomic Feshbach molecules. The dissociation process naturally produces nonlocal quantum correlations in spin, position-momentum, and path degrees of freedom, enabling the deterministic preparation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of massive particles and multiqubit states through hyperentangled encoding. Having each atom of the pair prepared in a matter waveguide, the scheme can be scaled to hundreds of parallel entanglement sources in an array connected to a matter wave optical network of beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometers, tunnel junctions and local detectors. The protocol builds on established techniques, including programmable optical potentials, high-fidelity single-particle control, single-molecule initialization, controlled molecular dissociation, and quantum gas microscopy with near-perfect detection, making it directly implementable with current technology. The proposed architecture naturally integrates with atomtronics circuits and chip-based matter-wave optics, offering a deterministic entanglement source for quantum nonlocality tests, precision metrology, and scalable neutral-atom quantum processors.</p>

For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers. However, we show that optimized fully symmetric Gaussian states enable rapidly approaching perfect privacy while maintaining near-optimal sensing performance. We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision.

            <p>Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a general protocol for realizing fast high-fidelity multi-qubit gates, through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. This way, we are able to control the states of the target qubits by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow error-prone direct control. The DD-gate protocol is developed and experimentally implemented within two distinct frameworks: a hardware-agnostic model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked within a general-purpose digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Likewise, we are able to thoroughly characterize the quantum mechanical dynamics behind the multi-qubit gates within IBMQ, without many of the experimental constraints faced by other quantum systems. While at the same time, we establish the protocol for the $^{15}$NV system, considering its specific properties. The DD-gates with $^{15}$NVs can represent a significant reduction in gate times and improved technological scalability, compared to current methods of target qubit control using dynamical decoupling. In addition, we propose a simple application of the method for high-efficiency polarization generation of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin. All experimental findings are supported by comprehensive open-source simulations in the two distinct frameworks. This work provides a robust hardware-agnostic strategy for quantum control, which can be implemented with arbitrary systems that fit the central-target qubits description. Thus, marking an essential step in technological scalability of future quantum devices.</p>

Mature semiclassical approaches reach their limits when confronted with quantized electromagnetic fields, while full Hilbert space treatments are often computationally prohibitive.

Our approach accounts for the non-commutativity in the quantum-to-classical transition in a natural way, and has the ability to capture quantum optical signatures while retaining compatibility with classical electromagnetics. For benchmarking, we compare our simulation results with experimental emission spectra of a strongly driven InGaAs quantum dot, finding excellent agreement.

            <p>Estimating a classical parameter encoded in the Hamiltonian of a quantum probe is a fundamental and well-understood task in quantum metrology. A textbook example is the estimation of a classical field's amplitude using a two-level probe, as described by the semi-classical Rabi model. In this work, we explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent quantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom. For both metrological scenarios, we focus on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state of the atomic probe. In the semi-classical Rabi model, the QFI is independent of the field amplitude and grows quadratically with the interaction time $\tau$. In contrast, when the atom interacts with a single coherent mode of the field, the QFI is bounded by 4, a constant dictated by the non-orthogonality of coherent states. We find that this bound can only be approached in the vacuum limit. In the limit of large amplitude $\alpha$, the QFI is found to attain its maximal value $1.47$ at $\tau =O(1)$ and $\tau =O(\alpha^2)$, and also shows periodic revivals at much later times. When the atom interacts with a sequence of coherent states, the QFI can increase with time but is bounded to scale linearly due to the production of entanglement between the atom and the radiation (back-action), except in the limit where the number of modes and their total energy diverge. Finally, in the continuous limit, where the atom interacts with many weak coherent states, this back-action can be simply interpreted as spontaneous emission, giving rise to the optimal interaction time and QFI rate.</p>

This hybrid Rydberg-atom polar-molecule RET represents a monopole-dipole energy exchange reaction that necessarily requires spatial overlap of the Rydberg-electron and molecular wavefunctions. Calculations, explicitly accounting for the charge-dipole interaction between the Rydberg electron and the molecular dipole, provide a quantitative explanation of the observations. Total parity is conserved in the reaction through the mixing of collisional angular momentum in the atom-molecule complex.

            <p>Recent experiments have searched for evidence of the impact of non-inertial motion on the entanglement of particles. The success of these endeavours has been hindered by the fact that such tests were performed within spatial scales that were only "local" when compared to the spatial scales over which the non-inertial motion was taking place. We propose a Sagnac-like interferometer that, by challenging such bottlenecks, is able to achieve entangled states through a mechanism induced by the mechanical rotation of a photonic interferometer. The resulting states violate the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequality all the way up to the Tsirelson bound, thus signalling strong quantum nonlocality. Furthermore, we show that the Bell-CHSH inequality remains violated even without using any form of post-selection up to the value $1+\sqrt{2}$. Our results demonstrate that mechanical rotation can be thought of as resource for controlling quantum non-locality with implications also for recent proposals for experiments that can probe the quantum nature of curved spacetimes and non-inertial motion.</p>

            <p>We have analyzed the dynamics of entanglement in dissipative fermionic and bosonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models and found that, when the decoherence channel preserves the chiral symmetry, they exhibit a revival of entanglement in a wide range of parameters. This behavior only emerges in the topological phase, with the visibility of the revival dropping to zero at the phase boundary. Furthermore, the revival acquires a universal character once the system size exceeds the localization length of the edge modes. Our findings indicate that the universal entanglement revival has its origin in the topological properties of the SSH model. These dynamical properties may be experimentally accessible, for example, using photonic quantum computers.</p>

            <p>We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Bringing two semi-infinite heat baths at different temperatures into thermal contact along a surface, the NESS arises at asymptotically late times as a stationary state that has modewise thermal properties and features a heat flow between the reservoirs. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the transition rate with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not couple to the heat flow, causing the detector to only register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</p>

Using the Gupta-Bleuler procedure in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge, we construct the physical Hilbert space and eliminate negative-norm states. The resulting theory predicts, in addition to conventional photons, the existence of dual photons associated with magnetic charges. We discuss the role of these dual excitations and their possible relevance in the broader context of electromagnetic duality and gauge theories.</p>

            <h2>A Verified Compiler for Quantum Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyi Li, Fenfen An, Federico Zahariev, Zhi Xiang Chong, Amr Sabry, Mark S. Gordon</p>
            <p>Hamiltonian simulation is a central application of quantum computing, with significant potential in modeling physical systems and solving complex optimization problems. Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus on low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability and offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation pipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for compiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics, from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue, including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

            <p>We present a pedagogical work-in-progress. This textbook aims to introduce Hilbert space representations for quantum and classical dynamics, outlining the mathematical foundations, practical guidance, and Python implementation of dynamical simulations. Beginning with a historical survey, the book systematically develops the mathematical foundations, kinematic descriptions, and formal evolution theory needed to understand both classical and quantum systems. It then provides practical guidance for numerically simulating time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger evolution, classical dynamics through symplectic integrators, and open quantum systems including phase-space formulations and stochastic unravellings.</p>

            <h2>Computational Relative Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Jakob Meyer, Asad Raza, Jacopo Rizzo, Lorenzo Leone, Sofiene Jerbi, Jens Eisert</p>
            <p>Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can, for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity, we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum information, complexity theory, and cryptography.</p>

            <h2>Quantum non-Gaussianity based on amplified photon statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ãva RÃ¡cz, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Ruppert, Radim Filip</p>
            <p>Amplification is an essential part of quantum processing and detection that allows for reducing subsequent loss and noise. However, the intensive amplification transfers individual discrete quanta to a detected continuous signal, so Fock probabilities of the unknown input state are not readily available. To solve this issue, we directly derive and analyze a quantum non-Gaussianity witness based on the photon number mean and variance (or alternatively, the second-order correlation $g^{(2)}$) of the unknown state, which can be inferred from post-amplification integrated intensity moments. Since this new witness is based on first and second moments only, measurement results are easy to correct for losses and additive noise.</p>

            <h2>Excited-CAFQA: A classical simulation bootstrap for the variational estimation of molecular excited states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bikrant Bhattacharyya, Gokul Ravi</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are iterative algorithms suited to implementation on current-era quantum devices. VQAs employ classical optimization to minimize cost functions evaluated on quantum circuits. However, the extent to which VQAs manage noise is often insufficient for quantum chemistry applications. One method of improving VQAs is through accurate ansatz initialization. The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation and Energy Estimation for Discretized Anharmonic oscillator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurav Suman, Bikash K. Behera, Vivek Vyas, Prasanta k. Panigrahi</p>
            <p>Anharmonic potential quantum system play crucial role in physics as they provide a more realistic description of oscillatory phenomena, which often deviate from the idealized harmonic model. However, simulating such system on classical computers is highly challenging due to nonlinear interactions, large state spaces, and the exponential scaling of memory and computational resources. In this work, quantum simulation is employed to model a quantum anharmonic oscillator (QAHO) using a 3-qubit system implemented on IBM's Quantum Experiences platform. A quantum circuit with a filter-based design and Toffoli gates is constructed to track quantum state evolution, capturing key phenomena like quantum revival. The framework is further extended to n-qubit system to enhance resolution and scalability. For energy estimation, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a TwoLocal ansatz and variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), are used to compute ground and excited state energies. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy with an error of only 1.11% compared to exact methods. Notably, VQE outperforms classical approximations such as perturbation theory (error 6.71%) and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation(error 5.36%), yielding more precise energy values. These results highlight the potential of quantum simulation and VQD as effective tools for investigating complex quantum system, paving the way for future application in quantum chemistry and materials science as quantum hardware continues to advance.</p>

As a proof of principle, we benchmark our simulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification of phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors. Classical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters, which are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware.

            <h2>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muzamil Shah, Shahid Qamar, Muhammad Waseem</p>
            <p>This paper theoretically investigates the manipulation of the Photonic Spin Hall Effect (photonic SHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in a cavity. The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable photonic SHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance under the condition of electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT), the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits photonic SHE similar to the CTL system, showing a maximum upper limit of photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist. This upper limit arises due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence photonic SHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence photonic SHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning photonic SHE. Finally, the results are equally valid and applicable to conventional $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity atomic systems. The results of angular photonic SHE are also discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ron Belyansky, Cheyne Weis, Ryo Hanai, Peter B. Littlewood, Aashish A. Clerk</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require post-selection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>A parametric down-conversion source interfering on a beam splitter can be described as both a source of entangled N00N-states or a source of independent, and thus uncorrelated squeezers. The disparity between these outcomes can be attributed to whether one takes a standard discrete- or continuous-variable approach to describing the system. More precisely, this difference in output is due to the types of measurements involved and the way in which the data is processed, as both setups are identical, clearly identical states are produced. Here we take a hybrid approach to describe the state, which is generated by parametric down-conversion as input state, and investigate the measurements of the output ports of the interferometer using photon number resolved detection. We show that the output of this interference is separable in the photon number picture and demonstrate the worth of photon-number correlation measures for the characterization of squeezed light sources for hybrid applications like Gaussian boson-sampling.</p>

We study scenarios where we can drive a Raman transition to generate photons with specific temporal shapes and to absorb, and hence detect, single photons. The strong atom-cavity interaction can also be used to implement the atom-photon controlled-phase gate, which can then be used to construct photon-photon gates, create photonic cluster states, and perform non-demolition detection of single photons. We provide numerics validating our methods and discuss the implications of our results for several applications.</p>

            <h2>Propagation of intense squeezed vacuum light in non-linear media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Rivera-Dean, D. Kanti, P. Stammer, N. Tsatrafyllis, M. Lewenstein, P. Tzallas</p>
            <p>Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong-field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on interactions with single-atoms only, neglecting that under realistic conditions light propagates through the media. This raises two key questions: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media, and under what conditions it can generate observable nonlinear signals? We address these questions by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media using high-harmonic generation as a nonlinear observable. We found that the infrared photon losses, atomic ground-state depletion and atomic ionization, induce decoherence effects which significantly limit the propagation length in the medium, and reduce the harmonic yield by more than two orders of magnitude compared to that produced by coherent laser light. Nevertheless, we establish the conditions under which BSV generated harmonics can be detected. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation in all states of matter.</p>

            <p>Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for building scalable quantum networks, with electro-optics conversion emerging as a promising approach. Recent experiments, however, observe significant quality factor degradation in superconducting microwave cavities when realizing the electro optics transducers. Here, we identify the piezomechanical scattering, where microwave photon loss through phonon radiation into substrate, as a universal dissipation mechanism in these hybrid quantum devices. By establishing a direct analogy to Rayleigh scattering theory, we derive universal scaling laws governing phononic dissipation process. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off that optimizing coherent transduction coupling inevitably increases dissipation, regardless of the configurations of microwave and optical cavities. We propose potential strategies to overcome this challenge. These findings establish piezomechanical scattering as a critical design constraint for quantum transducers and provide insights to optimize their performances toward practical quantum networking.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a highly sensitive real-time magnetometry method at two measurement points. This magnetometry method is based on the frequency-division multiplexing of continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance. We use two ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers separated by 3.6 mm to measure a magnetic field. A different bias field is applied to the two NV ensembles to resolve the resonance peak for each ensemble in the frequency space and enables the multiplexed magnetometry at the two points. The sensitivities achieved at the measurement points are $21~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and $22~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$. The proposed magnetometry method can be expanded to include more measurement points and shorter spacing. The capability of real-time measurement at numerous points with short spacing and high sensitivity is beneficial for various applications, including biomagnetic sensing, geophysical research, and material science.</p>

            <p>The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields -- a fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$~G, provide unique astrophysical laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at $\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong decrease in polarization from 2~keV to 4~keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence (VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.</p>

            <p>Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip. Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss.

            <p>We introduce a novel formulation of a Generalized Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state that resolves all of its foundational pathologies, such as infinite energy, non-normalizability, and or- thogonality. We demonstrate that these issues are artifacts of defining the code on an unbounded phase-space. By considering the compact quantum-phase-space intrinsic to systems like coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, we have obtained a Generalized GKP (GGKP) state that is both exact and physically realizable. This is achieved by applying an obtained Quantum Zak Transform (QZT) to Squeezed Coherent States, which reveals that Riemann-Theta functions are the natural representation of these states on the quantum torus phase-space. This framework not only provides a well-behaved quantum state, but also reveals a deep connection between quantum error correc- tion, non-commutative geometry, and the theory of generalized Theta functions. This opens a new avenue for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Fairly quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structures (such as symmetries or encodings) is a fundamental challenge for benchmarking quantum technologies. We introduce the "Reference-Contingent Complexity" (RCC). Its core idea is to utilize the quantum relative entropy to measure the extent to which a state deviates from its "structured vacuum" (the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace), thereby only pricing the generation of non-trivial information. We establish a central theorem, establishing that the RCC is a rigorous information-theoretic lower bound on universal quantum circuit complexity, a bound that features a linear leading term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction for the non-uniformity of the spectral distribution. Furthermore, we establish an operational protocol based on quantum hypothesis testing, which connects this theoretical lower bound to experimentally accessible observables. This work provides a structurally-fair yardstick for quantum technologies and offers a new perspective for exploring the intrinsic connection between computational cost and the generation of non-trivial information.</p>

            <p>Quantum decoherence provides a framework to study the emergence of classicality from quantum system by showing how interactions with the environments suppress interferences and select robust states known as pointer states. Earlier studies have linked Gaussian coherent states with pointer states. More recently, it was conjectured that more general quantum states called joint momenta-coordinates states could also be considered as more suitable candidates to be pointer states. These states are associated to the concept of quantum phase space and saturate, by definition, generalized uncertainty relations. In this work, we rigorously prove this conjecture. Building on the Lindblad framework for the damped harmonic oscillator and applying Zurek's predictability-sieve criterion, we analyze both underdamped and overdamped regimes. We show that only in the underdamped case do joint momenta-coordinates states remain pure and robust for all times, establishing them as the true pointer states. This extends Isar's earlier underdamped treatment, generalizes the concept beyond Gaussian approximations, and embeds classical robustness in the quantum phase space formalism, with potential applications in error-resilient quantum information.</p>

            <p>Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.</p>

            <p>Accurately predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology, with profound implications for understanding biological functions and enabling structure-based drug discovery. Quantum computing approaches based on coarse-grained lattice models combined with variational algorithms have been proposed as an initial step towards predicting protein structures using quantum computers. In this work, we introduce a more efficient quantum protein structure prediction workflow that bypasses the need for explicit Hamiltonian construction by employing a problem-agnostic ansatz. The ansatz is trained to minimize an energy-based cost function that can be efficiently computed on classical computers, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing circuit depth compared to previous Hamiltonian-based methods. This enables a more scalable approach for larger proteins and facilitates the inclusion of higher-order interactions, previously hard to achieve in quantum approaches. We validate our method by benchmarking a hardware-efficient ansatz on a large set of proteins with up to 26 amino acids, modeled on the tetrahedral, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic lattices, incorporating up to second-nearest-neighbor interactions. We assess the performance on both a noise-free simulator and the ibm_kingston quantum computer using a set of distinct metrics to probe different aspects of the prediction quality. These experiments push the boundaries of quantum methods for protein structure prediction, targeting sequences that are longer than those typically addressed in prior studies. Overall, the results highlight the scalability and versatility of our approach, while also identifying key areas for improvement to inform future algorithm development and hardware advancements.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Color Code : Single-shot error correction for exotic topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida</p>
            <p>We present a family of simple three-dimensional stabilizer codes, called the chiral color codes, that realize fermionic and chiral topological orders. In the qubit case, the code realizes the topological phase of a single copy of the fermionic toric code. For qudit systems with local dimension $d$, the model features a chiral parameter $\alpha$ and realizes 3D topological phases characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_d^{(\alpha)}$ anyon theories with anomalous chiral surface topological order. On closed manifolds, the code has a unique ground state after removing bulk transparent fermions or bosons. Furthermore, we prove that the bulk is short-range entangled (for odd $d$, coprime $\alpha$) by constructing an explicit local quantum channel that prepares the ground state. The chiral color codes are constructed within the gauge color code, and hence inherit its fault-tolerant features: they admit single-shot error correction and allow code switching to other stabilizer color codes. These properties position the chiral color codes as particularly useful platforms for realizing and manipulating fermions and chiral anyons.</p>

            <h2>Optimal scheme for distributed quantum metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyao Hu, Allen Zang, Jianwei Wang, Tian Zhong, Haidong Yuan, Liang Jiang, Zain H. Saleem</p>
            <p>Optimal strategies for local quantum metrology -- including the preparation of optimal probe states, implementation of optimal control and measurement strategies, are well established. However, for distributed quantum metrology, where the goal is to estimate global properties of multiple spatially distributed parameters, the optimal scheme -- particularly the role of optimal control -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we address this challenge by developing optimal schemes for distributed quantum metrology that characterize the ultimate precision limits in distributed systems. We derive the optimal probe state, optimal control protocols, and measurement strategies in estimating a linear combination of $N$ independent unknown parameters coupled to $d$ networked sensors. Crucially, we prove that the optimal control operations can be implemented locally on each sensor, eliminating the need for non-local control operations across distant nodes. This result significantly reduces the complexity of implementing optimal strategies in distributed quantum metrology. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we apply it to several key scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Steady-State Entanglement with Floquet-Engineered Stabilizer Pumping in Neutral Atom Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Q. Guo, Shi-Lei Su, Weibin Li, X. Q. Shao</p>
            <p>We propose a dissipative protocol for preparing nonequilibrium steady-state entanglement in neutral atom arrays within a Floquet-Lindblad framework. Stabilizer pumping is implemented through noninstantaneous kicks, where each period consists of a short resonant laser pulse followed by a detuned strong $\pi$ pulse that couples the atomic ground state to a Rydberg state. This scheme is intrinsically fast and robust against the Doppler shifts and interatomic spatial fluctuations, as adiabatic requirements on the laser field are avoided. As such the engineered dissipation channels induce a fast decay rate, dramatically accelerating convergence toward the desired steady states. We show that this approach is inherently scalable and enables high-fidelity preparation of arbitrary multipartite graph states in the neutral atom array at zero and finite temperatures. Our study not only facilitates the preparation of resource states for measurement-based quantum computation but also provides a passive error-correction mechanism in the undergoing computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James D. Teoh, Nathanael Cottet, Patrick Winkel, Luke D. Burkhart, Luigi Frunzio, Robert J. Schoelkopf</p>
            <p>Entanglement generation lies at the heart of many quantum networking protocols as it enables distributed and modular quantum computing. For superconducting qubits, entanglement fidelity is typically limited by photon loss in the links that connect these qubits together. We propose and realize a new scheme for heralded entanglement generation that almost entirely circumvents this limit. We produce Bell states with $92\pm1\%$ state fidelity, including state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, between separated superconducting bosonic qubits in a high-loss regime where direct deterministic state transfer fails. Our scheme exploits simple but fundamental physics found in microwave links, specifically the ability to treat our communication channel as a single standing wave mode. Combining this with local measurements on bosonically encoded qubits allows us to herald entanglement with success probabilities approaching the scheme's upper limit of 50% per attempt. We then use the heralded Bell state as a resource to deterministically teleport a qubit between modules with an average state transfer fidelity of $90\pm1\%$. This is achieved despite the link possessing a direct single photon transfer efficiency of 2%. Our work informs the design of future superconducting quantum networks, by demonstrating fast coupling rates and low loss links are no longer strict requirements for high-fidelity quantum communication in the microwave regime.</p>

In this review, we provide a comprehensive examination of existing proposals for implementing Bell state measurements, highlighting their fundamental limitations and the strategies developed to overcome them. Additionally, we survey recent advances in Bell state measurements for high-dimensional systems, an area of growing interest due to its relevance in scalable quantum networks and high-capacity quantum communication.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Optomagnonic dielectric resonators offer a promising platform for the bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons at the single quantum level. Current implementation of such a conversion lacks from low magneto-optical interaction strength, limiting its practical utilization in quantum technologies. The main bottleneck is the small spatial overlap between optical and magnon modes. Here, we show that utilization of a disk and ring geometries notably increases the mode overlap. We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible.

            <h2>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iren Simko, Norah M. Hoffmann</p>
            <p>Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is fundamentally quantum or classical is essential for building accurate theoretical models and guiding experimental design. Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengfei Zhang, Shuyan Zhou, Ning Sun</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer RÃ©nyi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</p>

We use methods from large deviation theory to solve this problem exactly for a specific system: the deterministic quantum East circuit with boundary measurements. We show that conditioning on measurement outcomes generates a long-range correlated state, despite typical trajectories being trivial. We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to the SierpiÅski triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning for Quantum Noise Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karan Kendre</p>
            <p>Quantum noise fundamentally limits the utility of near-term quantum devices, making error mitigation essential for practical quantum computation. While traditional quantum error correction codes require substantial qubit overhead and complex syndrome decoding, we propose a machine learning approach that directly reconstructs clean quantum states from noisy density matrices without additional qubits. We formulate quantum noise reduction as a supervised learning problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder architecture with a novel fidelity-aware composite loss function. Our method is trained and evaluated on a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 10,000 density matrices derived from random 5-qubit quantum circuits, encompassing five noise types (depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, bit-flip, and mixed noise) across four intensity levels (0.05-0.20). The CNN successfully reconstructs quantum states across all noise conditions, achieving an average fidelity improvement from 0.298 to 0.774 ({\Delta} = 0.476). Notably, the model demonstrates superior performance on complex mixed noise scenarios and higher noise intensities, with mixed noise showing the highest corrected fidelity (0.807) and improvement (0.567). The approach effectively preserves both diagonal elements (populations) and off-diagonal elements (quantum coherences), making it suitable for entanglement-dependent quantum algorithms. While phase damping presents fundamental information-theoretic limitations, our results suggest that CNN-based density matrix reconstruction offers a promising, resource-efficient alternative to traditional quantum error correction for NISQ-era devices. This data-driven approach could enable practical quantum advantage with fewer physical qubits than conventional error correction schemes require.</p>

            <p>We introduce and conduct a theoretical analysis of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system, presenting a framework for generating multipartite quantum entanglement that is both robust and highly adjustable. The system leverages a sophisticated synergy of collective molecular enhancement, nonreciprocal directional coupling, and engineered $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dissipation. A central finding is the exceptional thermal resilience of this entanglement, which persists robustly at and well above room temperature, with a practical operational ceiling limited by material stability around \SI{700}{\kelvin}. This remarkable resilience, driven by ultra-high-frequency molecular vibrations and collective $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement, positions our system as a leading candidate for developing robust, high-temperature quantum technologies. Notably, our work directly addresses the performance trade-offs inherent in nonlinear enhancement schemes. By employing a two-collective-mode model to explicitly investigate vibration-vibration correlations, our $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric architecture achieves a balanced and powerful enhancement across all investigated bipartite entanglement channels: inter-cavity ($E_{ac}$), cavity-molecule ($E_{aB_1}$, $E_{cB_2}$), and critically, vibration-vibration ($E_{B_1B_2}$). These findings, rigorously validated within stable operational regimes, establish $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric McOM as a versatile platform for engineering advanced quantum information technologies</p>

It can be demonstrated that, the introduction of phonon-photon coupling enhances the coherence of the system when considering the Kerr nonlinearity of the YIG sphere. In contrast, the Kerr nonlinearity of photons is more conducive to the Mott insulating phase than that of the YIG sphere. We further elucidate the underlying physical mechanism by calculating the effective repulsive potential of the system in the presence of photonic Kerr nonlinearity. Regarding the ergodic-many body localization transition, the results indicate that as the disorder strength of the Kerr nonlinearity increases, the system transitions from the ergodic phase to the many body localized phase, while increasing the chemical potential expands the region of the ergodic phase. This work provides a novel framework for characterizing quantum phase transitions in cavity optomagnonic systems and offers an experimentally feasible scheme for studying them, thereby yielding valuable insights for quantum simulation.</p>

Using scattering theory to analyze two-excitation interactions, we reveal a profound simplification near critical points of the collective atomic excitation band structure, determined solely from single-excitation properties. At these critical points, scattering becomes universal and the full two-excitation scattering matrix decomposes into a block-diagonal form. Remarkably, all scattering processes involving the photon field are completely suppressed, resulting in the perfect isolation of a unitary, nonlinear interaction channel between collective dark spin waves. Our findings provide exact analytical insights into few-body nonlinearities and establish a universal framework for analyzing complex scattering phenomena in ordered atomic systems.</p>

We apply this formalism to the two-excitation case, deriving the complete analytical S-matrix and scattering cross sections for systems with two-level nonlinearities.

            <p>Coherent wavepacket expansion is a key component of recent proposals aiming to create non-classical states of a levitated dielectric nanoparticle. Free evolution, i.e., releasing the particle from its harmonic trapping potential and allowing its position variance to grow, is a simple but effective expansion scheme, but requires accurate force compensation to avoid significant mean displacements of the wavepacket during the free evolution. Here, using an optical trap-release-recapture sequence, we demonstrate an electrostatic compensation technique that enables free evolution without significant mean displacement in 3D, successfully compensating both gravity and stray electric fields. To achieve 100 microsecond free evolution times with charged particles, we developed methods to map and correct for force cross-talk, as well as to control the environmental charge state. Combined with a low decoherence environment, our approach enables the preparation of largely delocalized states without the need for long freefall trajectories or a low-gravity environment.</p>

            <p>Characterizing increasingly complex quantum systems is a central task in quantum information science, yet experimental costs often scale prohibitively with system size. Certifying key properties -- such as entanglement, circuit complexity, and quantum magic -- using simple local measurements is highly desirable but challenging. In this work, we introduce a highly general certification framework based on a physical phenomenon that we call localizable quantumness: for generic many-body states, essential quantum properties are robustly preserved within the projected ensembles on small subsystems after performing local projective measurements on the rest of the system. Leveraging this insight, we develop certification protocols that certify global properties by witnessing them on a small, accessible subsystem. Our method dramatically reduces experimental cost by relying solely on local Pauli measurements, while achieving constant sample complexity, constant-level noise robustness, and soundness for mixed states -- exponentially improving the sample complexity and overcoming major limitations of previous methods. We further present a random-basis variant to certify state fidelity, with numerical evidence strongly suggesting it maintains constant sample complexity and robustness for generic states, representing a substantial improvement over existing methods. Our results provide a practical, scalable toolkit for certifying large-scale quantum processors and offer a novel lens for understanding complex many-body quantum systems.</p>

As an alternative, we look for the initial states (pure or mixed) of the rotator that result in low entropy change. In order to create candidate initial states, we use an ansatz that align with the maximum entropy principle. We then find conditions for state preparation and system/bath parameters to achieve a small relative change in both linear and differential entropy in underdamped and non-underdamped regimes. We identify cases with relatively small entropy change and discuss their practical feasibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail S. Podoshvedov, Sergey A. Podoshvedov</p>
            <p>Continuous variable (CV) entanglement refers to the type of entanglement of quantum wave-like systems that are described by continuous variables in an inherently infinite-dimensional space. It can become a crucial resource for quantum communication, sensing and computation. We propose the mechanism of transfer of quantum entanglement (TQE) from a nonlocal photon to two initially separate single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) states. The nonlocal photon is the only original quantum resource from which entanglement is transferred to CV states of a certain parity without them directly interacting with each other in a deterministic manner. Measurement induced CV parity entanglement is tuned using initial squeezing and the beam splitter (BS) parameter allowing us to estimate the probability of transfer of maximum entanglement at sufficiently high brightness to be 0.2344 . If, instead of the original SMSV states, we use those from which one photon is initially subtracted, then the heralded technique can turn the probabilistic maximum entanglement transfer protocol into a nearly deterministic one, the probability of which is >0.98. Such a perfect TQE from the nonlocal photon to a maximally parity-entangled CV state can be considered the most suitable for applications, since it preserves the trade-off between the probability and brightness of the output non-Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Quantum public-key encryption (PKE), where public-keys and/or ciphertexts can be quantum states, is an important primitive in quantum cryptography. Unlike classical PKE (e.g., RSA or ECC), quantum PKE can leverage quantum-secure cryptographic assumptions or the principles of quantum mechanics for security. It has great potential in providing for secure cryptographic systems under potentially weaker assumptions than is possible classically. In addition, it is of both practical and theoretical interest, opening the door to novel cryptographic systems not possible with classical information alone. While multiple quantum PKE schemes have been proposed, they require a large number of qubits acting coherently, and are not practical on current noisy quantum devices. In this paper, we design a practical quantum PKE scheme, taking into account the constraints of current NISQ devices. Specifically, we design a PKE scheme with quantum-classical public keys and classical ciphertexts, that is noise-resilient and only requires a small number of qubits acting coherently. In addition, our design provides tradeoffs in terms of efficiency and the number of qubits that are required.</p>

            <h2>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Batin Tank</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.</p>

            <h2>Fast and Accurate Decoder for the XZZX code Using Simulated Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Sakashita (The University of Osaka)</p>
            <p>The XZZX code is a variant of the surface code designed to address biased noise in realistic quantum devices. For the XZZX code, we propose a decoder based on simulated annealing (SA). Our SA decoder can be readily and efficiently parallelized, by virtue of its simple MCMC-based algorithm. To prepare an initial configuration of SA, we propose to employ recovery chains obtained by a decoder which utilizes a kind of greedy matching graph algorithm. Although $Z$-biased noise is commonly assumed in real quantum devices, we focus on $Y$-biased noise, for which the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm fails to decode accurately. Our numerical simulation for the code capacity noise model, where only data qubits suffer errors, confirmed that our SA decoder is more accurate than the MWPM decoder. Furthermore, our SA decoder attained the accuracy equivalent to that of the optimal decoder formulated by integer programming, called CPLEX decoder. In our greedy matching decoder, we randomly determine order of matching pairs of incorrect syndromes that have the same distance. This randomness brings about a variety of initial configurations of SA, which leads to faster convergence of our SA decoder. By comparing decoding times of our SA decoder, the CPLEX decoder, and matrix product state (MPS) decoder, all of which can handle $Y$-biased noise appropriately, we confirmed that our SA decoder is fastest if parallelized. This result implies a potential for combining of our greedy matching and SA decoder for practical use in quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Portfolio Optimization: An Extensive Benchmark</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Stopfer, Friedrich Wagner</p>
            <p>Recently, several researchers proposed portfolio optimization as a potential use case for quantum optimization. However, the literature is lacking an extensive benchmark quantifying the potential of quantum computers for portfolio optimization. In this work, we fill this gap. We provide a computational study, comparing quantum approaches against state-of-the-art classical methods on a meaningful, real-world instance set. In particular, we compare quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm against classical mixed-integer programming, simulated annealing, steepest descent local search, tabu search and a problem-tailored heuristics. We consider a variant of portfolio optimization which we show to be particular difficult for classical solvers in practice. Our benchmark comprises 250 instances with up to 1,000 assets from actual stock data. The results show that all instances can be solved to proven optimality by mixed-integer programming in the order of seconds. Moreover, the problem-tailored heuristic consistently outperforms quantum approaches in terms of solution quality for fixed runtime. Thus, we conclude that there is only very limited room for a potential quantum advantage in portfolio optimization.</p>

            <h2>Bosonic content of three-fermion high-spin states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerzy Cioslowski, Krzysztof Strasburger, Denis K. Sunko</p>
            <p>A rigorous characterization of the information content of any high-spin threefermion wave function is presented. It is based upon a formal decomposition of the wave function into a finite set of fixed invariants, called shapes, whose sole purpose is to satisfy the Pauli principle, and a variable part, constituting the bosonic excitations of these invariants, that provides its physical content. As an example, this decomposition is applied to a benchmark-quality approximate wave function of the lowest-energy quartet electronic state of the lithium atom. This wave function, which comprises hundreds of basis functions, is reduced to eleven shape blocks, only five of which are numerically significant. Such a compact characterization is a generic example of the appearance of superselection rules in configuration space, and provides a qualitative aid in the search for robust few-particle entangled states</p>

            <p>To achieve a fault-tolerant quantum computer, it is crucial to increase the coherence time of quantum bits. In this work, we theoretically investigate a system consisting of a series of superconducting qubits that alternate between XX and YY ultrastrong interactions. By considering the two-lowest energy eigenstates of this system as a {\it logical} qubit, we demonstrate that its coherence is significantly enhanced: both its pure dephasing and relaxation times are extended beyond those of individual {\it physical} qubits. Specifically, we show that by increasing either the interaction strength or the number of physical qubits in the chain, the logical qubit's pure dephasing rate is suppressed to zero, and its relaxation rate is reduced to half the relaxation rate of a single physical qubit. Single qubit and two-qubit gates can be performed with a high fidelity.</p>

            <h2>The incompleteness of relativistic Spekkens' contextuality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruben Campos Delgado</p>
            <p>We show that the operational definition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens is, in general, not Lorentz invariant. Specifically, we consider particle states with both spin and momentum, apply a Lorentz transformation to obtain the states in a new inertial frame, and then trace out the momentum degrees of freedom in both frames. We find that spin states that are contextual in one frame can become non-contextual in the other. Hence, the Spekkens' notion of contextuality, when restricted to spin states only, is a frame-dependent concept. We apply our results to predict a novel relativistic effect concerning the task of discriminating between two quantum states. We show that the probability of success for a moving observer exceeds that of an observer at rest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sean Crowe, Stefan Evans, Alexei Smolyaninov</p>
            <p>We apply polymer quantization, a quantization technique sometimes used in high energy physics, to several superconducting circuits including: transmons, transmission line resonators, and LC circuits. In the case of transmon qubits and transmission line resonators, experimental predictions are very close to what is found with canonical quantization, though in this approach constant charge offsets can be interpreted as quantization ambiguities. In the case of LC circuits, polymer quantization predicts nonlinearities which are not present in the canonical approach. Based on this analysis we design and analyze a qubit which uses a meander inductor instead of a Josephson junction. Implications for qubit performance and fabrication are discussed. Given a choice for an effective phase operator, relevant parameters such as anharmonicity, frequency, and dispersive shifts are calculated for this meander inductor based qubit.</p>

            <p>This work investigates the nature of the ground state of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on minimal kagome cells -- a triangle and a star -- using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on real quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the ground state preparation is achievable using a shallow hardware-efficient quantum circuit with a naturally Euclidean parameter space. Our custom ansatz is capable of accurately recovering essential properties such as the spin correlation terms for each edge without explicit error mitigation. These features are found to be less sensitive to noise. We exploited the Fubini-Study metric in constructing the ansatz, ensuring a singularity-free parameter space. With this ansatz design, the quantum natural gradient coincides with the normal gradient, complemented with a backtracking search for dynamic step size adaptation. We refer to this regime as the implicit adaptive quantum natural gradient descent. It achieves faster convergence in fewer iterations compared to simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), while maintaining competitive runtime with the metric being analytically constant. We further apply error mitigation techniques, including zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) and qubit-wise readout error mitigation (REM). While ZNE does not obey the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle, the conditions under which REM preserves it are discussed.</p>

            <p>We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal a power-law decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.</p>

            <h2>Efficient formulation of quantum network under amplitude damping noise: Highlighting benefits over its Pauli-twirled counterpart</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudipta Mondal, Pritam Halder, Stav Haldar, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>At the heart of building a large-scale quantum internet lies the challenge of establishing long-distance entanglement using quantum repeaters, which mitigate direct transmission losses but introduce additional noise in the nodes via interactions with the environment and imperfect operations. This effect has typically been studied under a simplifying Pauli channel assumption. Our study focuses on distributing end-to-end entanglement in a homogeneous, repeater-based linear quantum network operating under a non-Pauli noise, specifically, amplitude damping noise, which we refer to as amplitude damping-affected quantum network (AQN). Unlike its twirled counterpart (TAQN), where the resulting state is fully Bell-diagonal with a single parameter, we prove that the AQN produces a block-diagonal state in the Bell basis with four parameters. We develop a method for the simulation of AQN, where we keep track of these four parameters of each entangled link, along with the number of times noise acts on it, i.e., its age, until it is consumed for swapping. Our results reveal that across diverse policies, including NESTING and SWAP-ASAP, AQN consistently outperforms TAQN in terms of both fidelity and average entanglement. The benefit is most significant in the low-probability regime of elementary link generation, highly relevant for near-term experiments. Notably, we also identify the coherence-time and link-probability regions where TAQN fails while AQN succeeds in distributing end-to-end entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Similarity as Thermodynamic Work: Between Depth and Diversity -- from Information Distance to Ugly Duckling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kentaro Imafuku</p>
            <p>Defining similarity is a fundamental challenge in information science. Watanabe's Ugly Duckling Theorem highlights diversity, while algorithmic information theory emphasizes depth through Information Distance. We propose a statistical-mechanical framework that treats program length as energy, with a temperature parameter unifying these two aspects: in the low-temperature limit, similarity approaches Information Distance; in the high-temperature limit, it recovers the indiscriminability of the Ugly Duckling theorem; and at the critical point, it coincides with the Solomonoff prior. We refine the statistical-mechanical framework by introducing regular universal machines and effective degeneracy ratios, allowing us to separate redundant from core diversity. This refinement yields new tools for analyzing similarity and opens perspectives for information distance, model selection, and non-equilibrium extensions.</p>

            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous excitation of a centripetally accelerated atom coupled to electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the rate of change of the mean atomic energy for centripetally accelerated atoms interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary, using the Dalibard-Dupont-Roc-Cohen-Tannoudji formalism. The distinct contributions from vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction are analyzed separately. Our results reveal that, when the centripetal acceleration significantly exceeds the characteristic acceleration set by the atomic transition frequency, vacuum fluctuations dominates over radiation reaction, irrespective of the atom-boundary distance and the atomic polarization. In the near-zone regime, where the atom-boundary distance is much smaller than both the characteristic length associated with the acceleration and the transition wavelength of the atom, the boundary introduces substantial corrections to the rate of change of the mean atomic energy. These corrections are comparable in magnitude to those in free space and exhibit strong dependence on the atomic polarization. Remarkably, in the intermediate and far regions, contributions stemming from the combined effects of the boundary and acceleration can become the leading and subleading terms, respectively. An acceleration-independent term also arises from their interplay. These findings highlight the significant interplay between acceleration and the presence of a boundary in shaping atomic radiative properties and may have potential implications for experimentally probing the circular Unruh effect.</p>

            <p>Computational materials science has evolved toward materials informatics, where large datasets of complex, multispecies compounds are generated and evaluated using density functional theory (DFT). Materials genome projects mine these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells. Our results link strain and twist angle to material informatics properties, including stability and band gap, and show that pyRMG can initialize and converge challenging RMG-based workflows with limited user intervention.</p>

            <p>We present a unified framework for quantum sensitivity sampling, extending the advantages of quantum computing to a broad class of classical approximation problems. Our unified framework provides a streamlined approach for constructing coresets and offers significant runtime improvements in applications such as clustering, regression, and low-rank approximation. Our contributions include: * $k$-median and $k$-means clustering: For $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, we give an algorithm that constructs an $\epsilon$-coreset in time $\widetilde O(n^{0.5}dk^{2.5}~\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering. Our approach achieves a better dependence on $d$ and constructs smaller coresets that only consist of points in the dataset, compared to recent results of [Xue, Chen, Li and Jiang, ICML'23]. * $\ell_p$ regression: For $\ell_p$ regression problems, we construct an $\epsilon$-coreset of size $\widetilde O_p(d^{\max\{1, p/2\}}\epsilon^{-2})$ in time $\widetilde O_p(n^{0.5}d^{\max\{0.5, p/4\}+1}(\epsilon^{-3}+d^{0.5}))$, improving upon the prior best quantum sampling approach of [Apers and Gribling, QIP'24] for all $p\in (0, 2)\cup (2, 22]$, including the widely studied least absolute deviation regression ($\ell_1$ regression). * Low-rank approximation with Frobenius norm error: We introduce the first quantum sublinear-time algorithm for low-rank approximation that does not rely on data-dependent parameters, and runs in $\widetilde O(nd^{0.5}k^{0.5}\epsilon^{-1})$ time. Additionally, we present quantum sublinear algorithms for kernel low-rank approximation and tensor low-rank approximation, broadening the range of achievable sublinear time algorithms in randomized numerical linear algebra.</p>

To support robust training and evaluation, we construct a dataset of 15,085 instances spanning three domains and five representative tasks. Experiments demonstrate that DiffQ surpasses baselines, reducing initial loss by up to 8.95 and convergence steps by up to 23.4%.</p>

            <p>Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces direction-dependent superfluidity - absent in cylindrically symmetric systems - enabling tunable anisotropy and potential applications in directional quantum sensing. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore, we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes.</p>

            <p>Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.</p>

Here we demonstrate a simple yet powerful criticality-enhanced method of microwave photon detection by operating a magnetic-field tunable Kerr Josephson parametric amplifier at the border of a first-order phase transition and close to the critical point. We obtain a 73\% efficiency and a dark-count rate of 167 kHz, corresponding to a responsivity of $1.3 \times 10^{17}~\mathrm{W}^{-1}$ and noise-equivalent power of 3.28 zW/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$. We verify the single-photon operation by extracting the Poissonian statistics of a coherent probe signal.</p>

            <p>We introduce a notion of commutativity between operators on a tensor product space, nominally Pauli strings on qubits, that interpolates between qubit-wise commutativity and (full) commutativity. We apply this notion, which we call $k$-commutativity, to measuring expectation values of observables in quantum circuits and show a reduction in the number measurements at the cost of increased circuit depth. Last, we discuss the asymptotic measurement complexity of $k$-commutativity for several families of $n$-qubit Hamiltonians, showing examples with $O(1)$, $O(\sqrt{n})$, and $O(n)$ scaling.</p>

            <p>We simulate the coherence of two coupled electron spins interacting with a bath of nuclei using the generalized cluster correlation expansion (gCCE) method. An exchange interaction between the electrons facilitates a family of entangling gates that can be spoiled by nuclear-induced dephasing. Consequently, we study the dephasing of the coherent two-electron system by characterizing the $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ of the two-electron reduced density matrix for various system parameters in the range mimicking magnetic molecules, including magnetic field strength and orientation, exchange interaction strength, distance between the two spins, minimum distance between electron and nuclei and between nuclei, and nuclei density. We find the optimal regime for each parameter in which the coherence time is maximized and provide a physical understanding of it.</p>

            <h2>Error Correction in Dynamical Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esther Xiao Zhen Fu, Daniel Gottesman</p>
            <p>We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.</p>

            <h2>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii</p>
            <p>The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Yang</p>
            <p>Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for applying postselection techniques to technical noise suppression, realistic quantum imaging and postselected distributed quantum sensing and offers new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyao Li, Dorota M. Grabowska, Martin J. Savage</p>
            <p>We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $\lambda\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\textit ibm\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\sim 30\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.</p>

            <h2>Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Claudet, Simon Perdrix</p>
            <p>Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithm for the gradient of a logarithm-determinant</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas E. Baker, Jaimie A. Greasley</p>
            <p>The logarithm-determinant is an widely-present operation in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator may be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum state--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished in $O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the input matrix with precision $\varepsilon$. A practical implementation of the required operator will likely need $\log_2N$ overhead, giving an overall complexity of $O((k\log_2 N)/\varepsilon^2)$. The method applies widely and converges super-linearly in $k$ when the condition number is high. The best classical method we are aware of scales as $N$. Given the same resource assumptions as other algorithms, such that an equal superposition of eigenvectors is available efficiently, the algorithm is evaluated in the practical case as $O(\log_2 N/\varepsilon^2)$. The output is given in $O(1)$ queries of oracle, which is given explicitly here and only relies on time-evolution operators that can be implemented with arbitrarily small error. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning.</p>

            <h2>Deciding Local Unitary Equivalence of Graph States in Quasi-Polynomial Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Claudet, Simon Perdrix</p>
            <p>We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.</p>

            <h2>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Atom in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj</p>
            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant cavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the cavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical solution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also predicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be approximately $0.1\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions between the manifolds of the system.</p>

            <p>Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a state-characterization task that benchmarks coherence and experimental control in quantum systems. Existing GME tests often require joint measurements on many qubits, posing experimental challenges for systems like time-bin encoded qubits and microwave photons from superconducting circuits, where qubit connectivity is limited or measurement noise grows with the number of jointly measured qubits. Here we introduce versatile GME and $k$-inseparability criteria applicable to any state, which only require measuring $O(n^2)$ out of $2^n$ (at most) $m$-body stabilizers of $n$-qubit target graph states, with $m$ upper-bounded by twice the underlying graph's maximum degree. For cluster or ring-graph states, only constant-weight stabilizers are needed. Using semidefinite programming, we further reduce both the number and weight of required stabilizers. Analytical and numerical results show that our criteria are noise-robust and can infer state infidelity from certified $k$-inseparability in microwave photonic graph states generated under realistic conditions.</p>

            <p>Levitation of macroscopic objects in a vacuum is key towards the development of high-precision inertial sensors and pressure sensors, as well as towards the fundamental studies of quantum mechanics and its relation to gravity. Diamagnetic levitation offers a passive method at room temperature to isolate macroscopic objects in vacuum environments, yet eddy current damping remains a critical limitation for electrically conductive materials. We show that there are situations where the motion of conductors in magnetic fields does not, in principle, produce eddy damping, and demonstrate an electrically conducting rotor diamagnetically levitated in an axially symmetric magnetic field in a high vacuum. Experimental measurements and finite-element simulations reveal gas collision damping as the dominant loss mechanism at high pressures, while residual eddy damping, which arises from symmetry-breaking factors such as platform tilt or material imperfections, dominates at low pressures. The conclusion is supported by an analytic proof and an analytic example of zero steady current density for a rotating conductor in a magnetic field. This demonstrates a macroscopic levitated rotor with extremely low rotational damping and paves the way to fully suppress rotor damping, enabling ultra-low-loss rotors for gyroscopes, pressure sensing, and fundamental physics tests.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase estimation plays a central role in quantum simulation as it enables the study of spectral properties of many-body quantum systems. Most variants of the phase estimation algorithm require the application of the global unitary evolution conditioned on the state of one or more auxiliary qubits, posing a significant challenge for current quantum devices. In this work, we present an approach to quantum phase estimation that uses only locally controlled operations, resulting in a significantly reduced circuit depth. At the heart of our approach are efficient routines to measure the complex phase of the expectation value of the time-evolution operator, the so-called Loschmidt echo, for both circuit dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. By tracking changes in the phase during the dynamics, the routines trade circuit depth for an increased sampling cost and classical postprocessing. Our approach does not rely on reference states and is applicable to any efficiently preparable state, regardless of its correlations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity and illustrate the results with numerical simulations. Our methods offer a practical pathway for measuring spectral properties in large many-body quantum systems using current quantum devices.</p>

In Part II, we evaluate the minimum number of ancillae required to perform coherent multiplication of block encodings and introduce a "space-accuracy tradeoff". Specfically, we prove that logarithmic ancillae is optimal for exact multiplication of block encodings, but show that (in certain block encoding regimes) approximate multiplication of block encodings can be achieved to high-precision with just one ancilla.</p>

Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.</p>

            <p>The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is evaluated based on the secrecy of Alice's key and the correctness of the keys held by Alice and Bob. A practical method for ensuring correctness is known as error verification, in which Alice and Bob reveal a portion of their reconciled keys and check whether the revealed information matches. In this paper, we point out that when error verification is performed in a QKD protocol, the definition of secrecy must be revised accordingly. We illustrate the necessity of this revision with a counterexample, showing that neglecting it can lead to an incorrect security claim. In particular, we observe that in the case of security proof method based on phase error correction, which is one of the mainstream approaches and also known as Koashi's approach, no explicit method has been established to properly incorporate the revised secrecy definition. To resolve this issue, we present a way to translate the phase error correction-based approach into another mainstream approach, called the leftover hashing lemma-based approach, also known as Renner's approach, where a solution has already been formulated. As a consequence, security proofs under the phase error correction-based approach automatically remain valid without any change in the secret key length, even if they implicitly consider error verification without revising the secrecy definition.</p>

            <p>Characterizing quantum dynamics is essential for quantifying arbitrary properties of a quantum process -- such as its ability to exhibit quantum-mechanical dynamics or generate entanglement. However, current methods require a number of experimental settings that increases with system size, leading to artifacts from experimental errors. Here, we propose an approximate optimization method that estimates property measures using only two mutually unbiased bases to compute their lower and upper bounds, and to reconstruct the corresponding processes. This system-size independence prevents error accumulation and allows characterization of the intrinsic quantum dynamics. Compared with quantum process tomography, we experimentally validate our method on photonic fusion and controlled-NOT operations, demonstrating accurate resource estimation while substantially reducing the number of required Pauli experimental settings: from 81 to 10 for the photonic fusion and to 2 for the controlled-NOT. These results show that our method is well-suited for estimation of dynamical properties in architectures ranging from chip-scale quantum processors to long-distance quantum networks.</p>

Assuming parity symmetry of the system, as in the Fermi-Hubbard and Heisenberg models, we construct symmetric and antisymmetric thermal states and employ a tailored quench spectroscopy scheme to recover the exact real and imaginary parts of two-point time correlators. Green's functions are then reconstructed through efficient signal analysis. The protocol is theoretically efficient, experimentally accessible, and directly applicable to both digital quantum computers and analog quantum simulators. Beyond Green's functions, the same framework extends naturally to out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC).

            <p>The indistinguishability of many bosons undergoing passive linear transformations followed by number basis measurements is fully characterized by the visible state of the bosons. However, measuring all the parameters in the visible state is experimentally demanding. We argue that the generalized bunching probability--which is the probability that all the input bosons arrive in a given subset of the output modes--provides useful partial information about the indistinguishability of the input bosons, by establishing that it is monotonic with respect to certain partial orders of distinguishability of the bosons. As an intermediate result, we prove that Lieb's permanental-dominance conjecture for immanants is equivalent to the following statement: for states that are invariant under permutations of the occupied visible modes, the generalized bunching probability is maximized when the bosons are perfectly indistinguishable. As a corollary, we show that if Lieb's conjecture holds, then the generalized bunching probability is monotonic with respect to the refinement partial order on what we refer to as partially labelled states. We also prove, unconditionally, that for states such that the single-particle density matrix is the same for each particle, the Haar average of the generalized bunching probability is Schur convex with respect to the eigenvalues of said single-particle density matrix. As an application of the Schur convexity, we show that when the single-particle density matrix is a Gibbs state, the mean generalized bunching probability serves as a thermometer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwok Ho Wan, Zhenghao Zhong</p>
            <p>Building upon [arXiv:2509.01224], we present a sketch on how to simulate the non-Clifford $d=5$ magic state cultivation circuits [arXiv:2409.17595] with a sum of $\approx 8$ Clifford ZX-diagrams on average, at $0.1\%$ noise. Compared to a magic cat state stabiliser decomposition of all $53$ non-Clifford spiders ($6{,}377{,}292$ terms required), this is more than $7 \times 10^{5}$ times reduction in the number of terms. Our stabiliser decomposition has the advantage of representing the final non-Clifford state (in light of circuit errors) as a sum of Clifford ZX-diagrams. This will be useful in simulating the escape stage of magic state cultivation, where one need to port the resultant state of cultivation into a larger Clifford circuit with many more qubits. Still, it's necessary to only track $\approx 8$ Clifford terms. Our result sheds light on the simulability of operationally relevant, high $T$-count quantum circuits with some internal structure.</p>

            <h2>Multi-block exceptional points in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aysel Shiralieva, Grigory A. Starkov, BjÃ¶rn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serve as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds.</p>

            <h2>Rare Event Simulation of Quantum Error-Correcting Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolyn Mayer, Anand Ganti, Uzoma Onunkwo, Tzvetan Metodi, Benjamin Anker, Jacek Skryzalin</p>
            <p>We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.</p>

            <h2>Molecular entanglement as a signature of the Unruh effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>The Unruh effect predicts that a uniformly accelerated observer perceives the vacuum seen by an inertial observer as a thermal bath at a temperature proportional to its proper acceleration. This phenomenon is often regarded as a flat spacetime ``cousin" of Hawking radiation. In this Letter, we first study the entanglement dynamics of a quantum system composed of two polarizable two-level subsystems undergoing centripetal acceleration in a vacuum. We demonstrate that the system's steady state can be entangled irrespective of the initial state, a distinct characteristic attributable to the circular manifestation of the Unruh effect. Through meticulous analysis, we then propose that this phenomenon can feasibly be detected using state-of-the-art optomechanical technologies, particularly with a quantum system of two molecules.</p>

            <h2>Does connected wedge imply distillable entanglement?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Mori, Beni Yoshida</p>
            <p>The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two boundary subsystems $A$ and $C$ can exhibit large mutual information $I(A:C)$ even when they are spatially disconnected on the boundary and separated by a buffer subsystem $B$, as long as $A$ and $C$ have connected entanglement wedge in the bulk. However, whether the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ contains distillable EPR pairs has remained a longstanding open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by showing that: i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at leading order in $G_N$, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement in a holographic mixed state $\rho_{AC}$, and ii) one-shot, one-way LOCC-distillable entanglement is given at leading order by locally accessible information $J^W(A|C)$, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system $B$ via $J^W(A|C) = S_A - E^W(A:B)$. Namely, we demonstrate that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement in one-shot, one-way LOCC. We also show that entanglement of formation $E_{F}(A:C)$ is given by $E^W(A:C)$ at leading order in holography.</p>

            <h2>Contrasting exchange-field and spin-transfer torque driving mechanisms in all-electric electron spin resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Reina-Galvez, Matyas Nachtigall, Nicolas Lorente, Jan Martinek, Christoph Wolf</p>
            <p>Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.</p>

We searched for a dark matter signal in the mass range $36.079 \, \mathrm{\mu eV} - 36.176 \, \mathrm{\mu eV}$ and found no significant evidence.

            <p>We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.</p>

            <p>A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics. These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.</p>

            <h2>Exact Solution for Two $Î´$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $Î´$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Olshanii, Mathias Albert, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Patrizia Vignolo, Steven G. Jackson</p>
            <p>In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</p>

            <p>It is challenging to build scalable quantum processors capable of both parallel control and local operation. As a promising platform to overcome this challenge, optical lattices offer exceptional parallelism. However, it has been struggling with precise local operations due to relatively narrow lattice spacings. Here, we introduce a new quantum processor incorporating orbit-qubit encoding and internal states (as auxiliary degrees of freedom) to achieve spatially selective operations together with parallel control. With this processor, we generate one-dimensional and two-dimensional cluster states using minimal layers of controlled-Z gates. We experimentally detect the multipartite entanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits through direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite non-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum computation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates, highlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations. Our results establish orbit-qubit optical lattices as a scalable quantum processing architecture, opening new pathways for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <h2>Measuring dark state number in the Tavis-Cummings model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Theerthagiri, Rajesh Narayanan, R. Ganesh</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanics allows for light-matter setups that hold excitations without releasing them as light. Arising from destructive interference processes, they are best seen in a Tavis-Cummings-like setup where two-level atoms (or qubits) are placed within a lossy cavity. If the system is initialized with some qubits excited and some in the ground state, there is a non-zero probability that no photons will be emitted. This can be framed as a Stern-Gerlach measurement, with a detector to measure if one or more photons leave the cavity. If no photons are detected, the qubits collapse onto a dark state. This can be viewed as heralding of a dark state based on zero photon detection. Building upon this idea, we propose a protocol to measure the number of independent dark states. Moreover, we show that this quantity is robust to arbitrary levels of disorder in the qubit-photon coupling constants. We then discuss a phase transition where the number of dark states plays the role of an order parameter. This provides an exciting example of a phase transition that is completely insensitive to disorder.</p>

            <h2>Photonic Spin Hall Effect using bilayer Graphene in Nano Optomechanical Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muqaddar Abbas, Muhammad Awais Altaf, Pei Zhang, Muhammad Waseem</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical model to obtain the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) in an optomechanical nanocavity using a graphene bilayer as the intracavity medium. In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the radiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the optomechanical interaction, cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction when probe field detuning is non-zero. The photonic SHE in bilayer graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.</p>

Here we use a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic (cQED) device that comprises a quantum dot and a high-impedance superconducting resonator to demonstrate, for the first time, strong coupling between the resonator microwave field and the motional quantum state of the electron. We find a coupling strength between the electron motion and a resonator photon of $g/2\pi=118$ MHz, exceeding both the electron motional state decoherence and the resonator loss. These experiments open new avenues for investigating light-matter interaction at the single electron level, and are a key step towards measurement and control of electrons on helium-based spin qubits.</p>

            <p>Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a microwave spin-photon interface based on a circular double quantum dot, inspired by recent experimental observations of anisotropic g-factors and ring states in InAs nanowires. We develop an effective theoretical model capturing the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic flux through the ring and show how ring states form at crossings of odd and even geometrical parity orbital states. Similar to bonding and antibonding states of conventional double quantum dots, the ring eigenstates can be changed into single dot states by detuning the dots, which enables a high degree of control over the system's properties. Applying a tilted magnetic field induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For low disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite spin and angular momentum. With increasing disorder, the spin-photon coupling becomes analogous to the flopping mode mechanism of conventional double quantum dots where the spin is hybridized with the bonding and antibonding orbital states without angular momentum. We show that the system exhibits a second-order charge-noise sweet spot at a specific magnetic field angle, which lowers the system's sensitivity to dephasing while retaining a substantial spin-photon coupling strength. Moreover, the photon coupling mechanism can be switched off either electrically, by detuning to the single-dot regime, or magnetically, by rotating the field to disable the spin-charge hybridization.</p>

            <p>Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are quantum circuits for characterizing complex quantum states. They have been proposed for recognizing quantum phases of matter at low sampling cost and have been designed for condensed matter systems in one dimension. Here we construct a QCNN that can perform phase recognition in two dimensions and correctly identify the phase transition from a Toric Code phase with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order to the paramagnetic phase. The network also exhibits a noise threshold up to which the topological order is recognized. Furthermore, it captures correlations between all stabilizer elements of the Toric Code, which cannot be accessed by direct measurements. This increases the threshold for errors leading to such correlations and allows for correctly identifying the topological phase in the presence of strong correlated errors. Our work generalizes phase recognition with QCNNs to higher spatial dimensions and intrinsic topological order, where exploration and characterization via classical numerics become challenging.</p>

By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.</p>

            <p>Controlling the motion of nanoscale objects at the quantum limit promises new tests of quantum mechanics and advanced sensors. Rotational motion is of particular interest, as it follows nonlinear dynamics in a compact, closed configuration space, which opens up a plethora of phenomena and applications beyond the possibilities of free or trapped linear motion. A prerequisite for such experiments is the capability to trap nanorotors and initialize them in a quantum ground state of libration. Here, we demonstrate the reliable, repetitive laser-induced loading of silica nanodimers and trimers into an optical tweezer. Coherent scattering in a high-finesse cavity allows us to cool two different librational modes to the quantum ground state with occupation numbers as low as $n_{\beta}=0.54\pm0.32$ and $n_{\alpha}=0.21\pm0.03$. By simultaneously cooling both degrees of freedom ($n_\beta=0.73\pm0.22$, $n_\alpha=1.02\pm0.08$) we align nanorotors to a space-fixed axis with precision better than 20$\,\mu$rad, close to the zero-point amplitude of librations.</p>

This contrasts with computationally secure schemes, where security claims are only asymptotic (i.e., under standard complexity assumptions, one only knows that $\varepsilon \to 0$ as the key size grows, but has no explicit bound). Here we explain the definition and interpretation of $\varepsilon$-security. Adopting an axiomatic approach, we show that $\varepsilon$ can be understood as the maximum probability of a security failure.

            <h2>Quantum speed limit for the OTOC from an open systems perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devjyoti Tripathy, Juzar Thingna, Sebastian Deffner</p>
            <p>Scrambling, the delocalization of initially localized quantum information, is commonly characterized by the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC). Employing the OTOC-Renyi-2 entropy theorem we derive a quantum speed limit for the OTOC, which sets an lower bound for the rate with which information can be scrambled. This bound becomes particularly tractable by describing the scrambling of information in a closed quantum system as an effective decoherence process of an open system interacting with an environment. We prove that decay of the OTOC can be bounded by the strength of the system-environment coupling and two-point environmental correlation functions. We validate our analytic bound numerically using the non-integrable transverse field Ising model. Our results provide a universal and model-agnostic quantitative framework for understanding the dynamical limits of information spreading across quantum many-body physics, condensed matter, and engineered quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>End-to-End Complexity Analysis for Quantum Simulation of the Extended Jaynes-Cummings Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nam Nguyen, Michael Yu, Alan Robertson, Hiromichi Nishimura, Samuel J. Elman, Benjamin Koltenbah</p>
            <p>The extended Jaynes-Cummings model (eJCM) is a foundational framework for describing multi-mode light-matter interactions, with direct applications in quantum technologies such as photon addition and quasi-noiseless amplification. However, the model's complexity makes classical simulation intractable for large systems that could be of practical interest. In this work, we present a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for the quantum simulation of the eJCM. We develop explicit quantum algorithms and circuits for simulating the system's time evolution using first and second-order product formulas, analyzing the dynamics in both the Schrodinger and interaction pictures. Our analysis includes rigorous, closed-form error bounds that guide the choice of simulation parameters, and we extend the methodology to efficiently handle both pure and mixed quantum states. Furthermore, we validate our theoretical cost models with numerical simulations and provide a detailed fault-tolerant resource analysis, compiling the simulation circuits for a surface-code architecture to yield concrete estimates for physical qubit counts and execution times. This work establishes a complete roadmap for simulating the eJCM on future quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Compared with Hermitian theory, non-Hermitian physics offers a fundamentally different mathematical framework, enabling the observation of topological phenomena that have no analogue in Hermitian systems. Among these, the exceptional point (EP) ring stands out as a quintessential topological feature unique to non-Hermitian systems. In this study, we employ single-photon interferometry to overcome the experimental challenge of precise phase control in quantum systems, thereby enabling a complete simulation of the non-Hermitian EP ring in three-dimensional parameter space without invoking any additional symmetry assumptions. By measuring the non-Hermitian dynamics in three-dimensional parameter space, we determine the system's eigenstates, which allows us to characterize the topological band structure of the system under different conditions. We describe the topological properties of the EP ring by extracting the Chern number and Berry phase for different parameter manifolds and observe the topological critical phenomena of the system. Our work paves the way for further exploration of topological non-Hermitian systems.</p>

We report the first loss-tolerant, audio-band squeezed light detection at 1984 nm by using a phase-sensitive amplifier to amplify the squeezed vacuum prior to detection. This technique increases the effective detection efficiency from 74% to 95% and increases the observed squeezing from 4 dB to 8 dB, the highest level of squeezing observed at this wavelength. Additionally, the shot-to-dark-noise clearance increases, extending the effective measurement bandwidth toward lower frequencies. This approach is largely wavelength-independent, extending high-fidelity quantum measurements to future gravitational-wave detectors and related quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The robust generation and manipulation of high-dimensional quantum states lies at the heart of modern quantum computation. The use of topology to resiliently encode and transport quantum information has been widely investigated in condensed matter and has recently penetrated quantum photonics. However, a route to scale up to a large number of entangled topological photonic modes had been missing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to generate high-dimensional topological photonic entanglement. Our platform relies on carefully designed silicon photonic waveguide topological superlattices, which support nonlinear generation of energy-time entangled photon pairs on a superposition of multiple topological modes. Our measurements and theoretical analysis reveal entanglement of up to five topological modes with resilience to nanofabrication imperfections. This study, at the intersection of nonlinear integrated photonics, quantum information, and topology, opens a research avenue toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum photonic states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Talal Ahmed Chowdhury, Vladimir Korepin, Vincent R. Pascuzzi, Kwangmin Yu</p>
            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is a fundamental model in condensed matter physics that describes strongly correlated electrons. On the other hand, quantum computers are emerging as powerful tools for exploring the complex dynamics of these quantum many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate the quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using IBM's superconducting quantum computers, employing over 100 qubits. We introduce a first-order Trotterization scheme and extend it to an optimized second-order Trotterization for the time evolution in the Fermi-Hubbard model, specifically tailored for the limited qubit connectivity of quantum architectures, such as IBM's platforms. Notably, both Trotterization approaches are scalable and maintain a constant circuit depth at each Trotter step, regardless of the qubit count, enabling us to precisely investigate the relaxation dynamics in the Fermi-Hubbard model by measuring the expectation value of the NÃ©el observable (staggered magnetization) for time-evolved quantum states. Finally, our successful measurement of expectation values in such large-scale quantum many-body systems, especially at longer time scales with larger entanglement, highlights the quantum utility of superconducting quantum platforms over conventional classical approximation methods.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Dial for High-Harmonic Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Wang, Andrew M. Parks, Adam Thorpe, Graeme Bart, Thomas Brabec</p>
            <p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly nonlinear optical process that typically requires an intense laser to trigger emissions at integer multiples of the driving field frequency. Since HHG is commonly used as a spectroscopic tool to probe material properties, it becomes impossible to extract information about a material without introducing distortions caused by the strong driving field. Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum sources have allowed HHG to be driven by purely quantum fields alone. Our work focuses on controlling and tuning HHG emission using a weak classical driving field with energy 1000 times less than that used in conventional HHG experiments, perturbed by an even weaker quantum field, such as bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). Our technique opens new avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials by minimizing issues such as laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. Our results show that a BSV pulse, containing less than 0.5% of the driving laser energy, can serve as an optical dial for tuning nonlinear emission, electron dynamics, and ionization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiyang Yu, Tao Jiang, Li-Chen Zhao</p>
            <p>We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.</p>

            <p>Photons, unlike electrons, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, yet synthetic gauge fields can impart magnetic-like responses and enable topological transport. Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled route, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints complex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing such driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a reconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic gauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing discretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This approach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation that reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high visibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal Floquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a first-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number quantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results establish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully programmable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to engineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number signatures of chiral transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davood Momeni</p>
            <p>Recent work has revealed that entanglement entropy growth in conformal field theories (CFTs) can be suppressed when a local operator quench interacts with a mixed-state excitation, providing a dual interpretation in terms of black hole scattering in AdS. This phenomenon, termed \emph{entanglement suppression}, opens several promising directions for exploration. In this proposal, I outline five distinct yet interconnected research trajectories: generalization to higher dimensions, the role of quantum chaos via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), the absence of suppression in integrable models, the extension to entanglement negativity as a probe of mixedness, and a geometric interpretation based on scattering cross sections in AdS. Each direction offers new insights into the interplay between holography, non-equilibrium dynamics, and quantum information.</p>

            <p>Can a distributed network of quantum sensors estimate a global parameter while protecting every locally encoded value? We answer this question affirmatively by introducing and analysing a protocol for distributed quantum sensing in the continuous-variable regime. We consider a multipartite network in which each node encodes a local phase into a shared entangled Gaussian state. We show that the average phase can be estimated with high precision, exhibiting Heisenberg scaling in the total photon number, while individual phases are inaccessible. Although complete privacy - where all other combinations of phases remain entirely hidden - is unattainable for finite squeezing in multi-party settings, it emerges in the large-squeezing limit. We further investigate the impact of displacements and optical losses, revealing trade-offs between estimation accuracy and privacy. Finally, we benchmark the protocol against other continuous-variable resource states.</p>

            <p>Entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) are essential for generating high-fidelity entangled states in noisy quantum systems, enabling robust quantum networking and computation. Building on the circuit of the foundational recurrence protocol, we generalize two-way EPPs to arbitrary stabilizer codes.

We propose efficient circuit designs for EPPs tailored to dual-species Rydberg atom arrays, leveraging species-specific laser control and interspecies Rydberg interactions. Introducing a low-overhead operation set, the dual-species atom convenient operation set, we facilitate straightforward compilation of EPP circuits without the need for ancillary atoms or complex atom rearrangements. Our framework provides practical guidance for near-term implementations on dual-species platforms, advancing towards scalable entanglement distribution in neutral atom systems and paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Govindarajan, M. Mazzei, H. Wang, L. Tian</p>
            <p>Cluster states are multipartite entangled states that are maximally connected and resilient to decoherence, making them valuable resources for quantum information processing. Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states have been extensively investigated for such applications. Here we present a pulsed protocol for generating CV cluster states in a phononic quantum network composed of phonon waveguides, mechanical resonators, and optical cavities. A key feature of this architecture is the modular design, where pairs of mechanical modes act as building blocks with only local, tunable interactions between mechanical and cavity modes. The scheme is scalable, requiring just $4N$ driving tones for $N$ mechanical resonators. We characterize the resulting cluster states by evaluating the nullifiers of the CV modes. We also study the effects of dissipation, showing that strong squeezing with large phonon occupations can degrade the generated cluster states under finite mechanical and optical losses. As a direct application, we demonstrate that distant mechanical modes can be entangled via local measurements.</p>

            <p>The Nonequilibrium Fermi's Golden Rule (NE-FGR) provides a convenient theoretical framework for calculating the charge transfer rate between a photoexcited bright donor electronic state and a dark acceptor electronic state, when the nuclear degrees of freedom start out in a nonequilibrium initial state. In this paper, we show that NE-FGR rates can be significantly modified by placing the molecular system inside an electromagnetic microcavity, even when the coupling with the cavity modes is weak. In this case, cavity-modified NE-FGR rates can also be estimated from the same inputs needed for calculating the cavity-free NE-FGR rates, thereby bypassing the need for an explicit simulation of the molecular system inside the cavity. We also introduce an approximate limit of the cavity-modified NE-FGR, which we denote cavity-modified Instantaneous Marcus Theory, since it is based on the same assumptions underlying Marcus theory. The utility of the proposed framework for calculating cavity-modified NE-FGR rates is demonstrated by applications to photo-induced charge transfer in the carotenoid-porphyrin-C$_{60}$ molecular triad dissolved in liquid tetrahydrofuran and the Garg-Onuchic-Ambegaokar model for charge transfer in the condensed phase.</p>

By driving the qubits, the steady state of this qubit-qubit coupling scheme becomes the maximally entangled Bell state. We devise a protocol where the system converges to this entangled state and benchmark it including qubit decay and dephasing. The protocol is numerically tested on a hybrid system consisting of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to magnon surface modes of an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. We show that the dephasing time of the NV centers forms the bottleneck for achieving the entanglement of NV centers separated by a distance exceeding microns. Our findings identify the key technological requirements and demonstrate a viable route toward steady-state entanglement of solid-state spins over distances of several microns using magnonic quantum networks, expanding the toolbox of magnonics for quantum information purposes.</p>

            <p>Molecular polaritons within the mid-infrared regime have emerged as a source for modifying and manipulating molecular and photonic properties. However, the development of new methodologies for photon generation is still a challenge in nanophotonics. We propose a molecular model based on the Holstein-quantum-Rabi Hamiltonian, which also incorporates realistic dipole moments and non-adiabatic couplings among electronic excited states, to study the ultrafast photodynamics of diatomic molecules in confined electromagnetic fields within quantized cavities. In addition to vibronic transitions due to intrinsic non-adiabatic couplings, two types of light-induced crossings emerge: one type is located at molecular nuclear geometries where the rotating wave approximation is fulfilled, and another type appears at different geometries where counter-rotating transitions may occur. We make a comprehensive study of polariton photodynamics within a time window of a few tens of femtoseconds, where dissipative mechanisms do not influence the polariton photodynamics. We stress the dramatic change of the polariton energy spectrum as a function of the Huang-Rhys factor when non-adiabatic couplings are included in the model. We conclude that both the molecular non-adiabatic couplings and, more specifically, the counter-rotating couplings in the cavity-molecule interaction play a crucial role in converting vibronic energy into photons through excited dressed states. We also show that the sign of the Huang-Rhys factor has a significant impact on this photon conversion. Our work paves the way for the development of many-photon generation powered by strong light-matter interaction, along with potential applications using alkaline earth monohydride molecules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farokh Mivehvar</p>
            <p>Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Vivas-ViaÃ±a</p>
            <p>Reduced abstract. This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in collective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures, focusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay among quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a rich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been widely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters modelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting superradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly connecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to the Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical studies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity, photon statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology. The sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving strength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging. Unexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population through dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we develop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We also analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying five mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced here. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables scalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as quantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous broadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing cooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>With rapid progress being made in the development of platforms for quantum computation, there has been considerable interest in whether present-day and near-term devices can be used to solve problems of relevance. A commonly cited application area is the domain of quantum chemistry. While most experimental demonstrations of quantum chemical calculations on quantum devices have focused on the ground-state electronic energy of the system, other properties of the ground-state, such as the electric dipole moment, are also of interest. Here we employ the quantum computed moments (QCM) method, based on the Lanczos cluster expansion, to estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on an IBM Quantum superconducting quantum device. The noise-mitigated results agree with full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations to within 0.03 $\pm$ 0.007 debye (2% $\pm$ 0.5%), compared to direct expectation value determination (i.e. VQE) with errors on the order of 0.07 debye (5%), even when the VQE calculation is performed without noise. This demonstrates that moments-based energy estimation techniques can be adapted to noise-robust evaluation of non-energetic ground-state properties of chemical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cillian Harney, Stefano Pirandola</p>
            <p>The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for multi-path routing, we employ an efficient and practical multi-path routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Qian Wu, Ge Sun, Jing Lu, Lan Zhou</p>
            <p>We consider two two-level quantum emitters (QEs) with separations on the order of the wavelength which are chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide, and the electromagnetic field of the 1D waveguide has a direction-dependent velocity, which produces two field propagation phases on the dynamics of QEs. Their spontaneous process is examined for QEs having unequal emission rates to the waveguide. It is found that radiation could be enhanced for both QEs, inhibited for both QEs, enhanced for one while inhibited for the other, completely suppressed for both QEs. In particular, the mechanism for radiation completely suppressed is the presence of a QE-photon bound state.</p>

            <h2>Strong antibunching photons/photon pairs emission in two atoms cavity QED system with the Van der Waals interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhouyang Yu, Jinping Xu, Chengjie Zhu, Zhengyang Bai, Yaping Yang</p>
            <p>Weinvestigate the generation of antibunching photons and photon pairs in a two-atom cavity QED system leveraging interatomic van der Waals (vdW) interaction. We show that the vdW interaction shifts the two-atom excited state, enabling the suppression of two-photon excitation via destructive interference in a diamond configuration. This leads to antibunching photon emission with extremely high purity. Furthermore, by tuning the vdW interaction strength, the conditions for conventional and unconventional photon blockades can overlap, significantly enhancing single-photon emission. Conversely, at the antiblockade excitation frequency, quantum Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the feasibility of generating antibunching photon pairs with a high purity and reasonable leaking rate by selecting appropriate driving field Rabi frequency and vdW interaction strength. These f indings on enhanced single/two-photon emission could lead to more efficient and brighter quantum light sources.</p>

            <p>Quantum dot single-photon sources are promising for quantum communication. Yet, the most advanced devices operate near 900 nm, where standard single-mode fibers experience significant losses. We address this by employing a hollow-core fiber engineered for low-loss transmission at quantum dot wavelengths, with measured loss of 0.65 dB/km and potentially as low as 0.12 dB/km near 934 nm. The fiber also supports strong classical signals at 1550 nm without adding Raman noise. Using this platform, we transmit all four BB84 polarization states from an InAs quantum dot over 340 m with 0.1% QBER, preserving single-photon purity and indistinguishability even in the presence of a strong classical signal. These results highlight how tailored transmission media enable quantum networks beyond the limits of standard telecom fibers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Noise Tomography with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonin Sulc</p>
            <p>Characterizing the environmental interactions of quantum systems is a critical bottleneck in the development of robust quantum technologies. Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for performing Lindblad tomography using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By embedding the Lindblad master equation directly into the neural network's loss function, our approach simultaneously learns the quantum state's evolution and infers the underlying dissipation parameters from sparse, time-series measurement data. Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing quantum systems to process temporal data efficiently by bypassing the costly training of gradient-based learning methods. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this approach to predict and characterize chaotic dynamics in discrete nonlinear maps, exemplified through the logistic and HÃ©non maps. While achieving excellent predictive accuracy, we also demonstrate the optimization of training hyperparameters of the quantum reservoir based on the properties of the underlying map, thus paving the way for efficient forecasting with other discrete and continuous time-series data. Furthermore, the framework exhibits robustness against decoherence when trained in situ and shows insensitivity to reservoir Hamiltonian variations. These results highlight quantum reservoir computing as a scalable and noise-resilient tool for modeling complex dynamical systems, with immediate applicability in near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guglielmo Grimaldi, Matthew Headrick, Veronika E. Hubeny</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</p>

Here, we demonstrate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave (CW) entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dots (QDs) at low temperatures. We use superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to maximize the time resolution ($\sim$70 ps) and emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). To our knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration of HED in the solid state and establish NIR QDs as a bright, tunable model system with longer-lived coherences and integrability with optical cavities as an additional experimental control knob.</p>

            <p>We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Winklmann, Martin Schulz</p>
            <p>Neutral atom quantum computing's great scaling potential has resulted in it emerging as a popular modality in recent years. For state preparation, atoms are loaded stochastically and have to be detected and rearranged at runtime to create a predetermined initial configuration for circuit execution. Such rearrangement schemes either suffer from low parallelizability for acousto-optic deflector (AOD)-based approaches or are comparatively slow in case of spatial light modulators (SLMs). In our work, we introduce an algorithm that can improve the parallelizability of the former. Since the transfer of atoms from static SLM traps to AOD-generated movable traps is detrimental both in terms of atom loss rates and execution time, our approach is based on highly-parallel composite moves where many atoms are picked up simultaneously and maneuvered into target positions that may be comparatively distant. We see that our algorithm outperforms its alternatives for near-term devices with up to around 1000 qubits and has the potential to scale up to several thousand with further optimizations.</p>

We achieve 99.6(3)% readout fidelity at 98.2(3)% survival probability and up to 68(2)% single-atom stochastic loading probability. We further develop a model to predict the survival probability, which also agrees well with several other atom array experiments. Our technique cools both the axial and radial directions, and will enable future continuously-operated neutral atom quantum processors and quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Encrypted-state quantum compilation scheme based on quantum circuit obfuscation for quantum cloud platforms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenyi Zhang, Tao Shang, Xueyi Guo, Yuanjing Zhang</p>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, quantum compilation has become a crucial layer connecting high-level algorithms with physical hardware. In quantum cloud computing, compilation is performed on the cloud platforms, which expose user circuits to potential risks such as structural leakage and output predictability. To address these issues, we propose the encrypted-state quantum compilation scheme based on quantum circuit obfuscation (ECQCO), the first secure compilation scheme tailored for the co-location of compilers and quantum hardware for quantum cloud platforms. It applies quantum homomorphic encryption to conceal output states and instantiates a structure obfuscation mechanism based on quantum indistinguishability obfuscation, effectively protecting both functionality and topology of the circuit. Additionally, an adaptive decoupling obfuscation algorithm is designed to suppress potential idle errors while inserting pulse operations. The proposed scheme achieves information-theoretic security and guarantees computational indistinguishability under the quantum random oracle model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ECQCO achieves a total variation distance (TVD) of up to 0.7 and a normalized graph edit distance (GED) of 0.88, enhancing compilation-stage security. Moreover, it introduces only a slight increase in circuit depth, while keeping the average fidelity change within 1\%, thus achieving a practical balance between security and efficiency.</p>

We investigate several gate protocols between single T centers, including two probabilistic photon interference-based schemes, a near-deterministic photon scattering gate, and a deterministic magnetic dipole-based scheme. In particular, we study a photon interference-based scheme with feedback which can achieve success probabilities above 50%, and use the photon-count decomposition method to perform the first analytical calculations of its entanglement fidelity and efficiency while accounting for imperfections. We also calculate the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes. Finally, we compare the performance of all the schemes, considering current and near-future experimental capabilities. In particular, we find that the photon interference-based scheme with feedback has the potential to achieve competitive efficiency and fidelity, making it interesting to explore experimentally.</p>

            <p>We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.</p>

Various possible configurations of three-level systems under exact two-photon resonance are considered. It is shown that in all these schemes, the lifetime of the studied states is determined by the dephasing time between levels that are not connected by a dipole transition. An efficient population transfer through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon detunings has been studied numerically.</p>

            <h2>Low-Frequency Scattering of TE and TM Waves by an Inhomogeneous Medium with Planar Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhang Loran, Ali Mostafazadeh, Cem YetiÅmiÅoÄlu</p>
            <p>Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency scattering of these waves.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum sensing for spectroscopy in a system consisting of a two-level atom coupled to a continuum of modes. We focus on optimizing the pulse shape of a coherent state to maximize the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the emitted light with the aim of estimating the atom's dipole moment, which is proportional to its spontaneous emission rate. To achieve this, we derive a set of coupled differential equations, which include the standard optical Bloch equations as a subset and whose solution directly yields the QFI of the emitted light without resorting to finite-difference methods. Furthermore, we analyze the factors that govern its optimization, provide analytic solutions in both the long and the short pulse width limits, and examine the role of the average photon number of the pulses. We then show that under the closed (periodic) boundary conditions, the harmonic (plane-wave) with frequency equal to half the spontaneous emission rate and a phase determined by detuning are optimal in the long pulse width limit.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between atomic states by a strong coherent of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and $m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</p>

            <p>Controlling chemical and material properties through strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities has gained considerable attention over the past decade. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood, and a significant gap persists between experimental observations and theoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically multi-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs across different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a macroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as Fabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of individual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect the macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient computational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB) with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations (DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both the cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate the potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we calculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that directly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide local, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles, which is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs can be optimized to target specific microscopic applications. Finally, we outline future directions to enhance the predictive power of this framework, including extension to finite temperature, condensed phases, and correlated quantum effects.</p>

            <p>Continuous time crystals, i.e., nonequilibrium phases with a spontaneously broken continuous time-translational symmetry, have been studied and recently observed in the long-time dynamics of open quantum systems. Here, we investigate a lattice of interacting three-level particles and find two distinct time-crystal phases that cannot be described within mean-field theory. Remarkably, one of them emerges only in the presence of correlations, upon accounting for beyond-mean-field effects. Our findings extend explorations of continuous time-translational symmetry breaking in dissipative systems beyond the classical phenomenology of periodic orbits in a low-dimensional nonlinear system. The proposed model applies directly to the laser-driven dynamics of interacting Rydberg states in neutral atom arrays and suggests that the predicted time-crystal phases are observable in such experiments.</p>

            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

            <p>Measurements are essential for the processing and protection of information in quantum computers. They can also induce long-range entanglement between unmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more general problems in quantum control.</p>

It can only correct up to half the code distance and must output a unique answer. Quantum list decoding offers a promising alternative. By allowing the decoder to output a short list of possible errors, it becomes possible to tolerate far more errors, even under worst-case noise. But two fundamental questions remain: which quantum codes support list decoding, and can we design decoding schemes that are secure against efficient, computationally bounded adversaries? In this work, we answer both. To identify which codes are list-decodable, we provide a generalized version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Then, using tools from quantum cryptography, we build an unambiguous list decoding protocol based on pseudorandom unitaries. Our scheme is secure against any quantum polynomial-time adversary, even across multiple decoding attempts, in contrast to previous schemes. Our approach connects coding theory with complexity-based quantum cryptography, paving the way for secure quantum information processing in adversarial settings.</p>

            <h2>Retrocausal capacity of a quantum channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Ji, Seth Lloyd, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>We study the capacity of a quantum channel for retrocausal communication, where messages are transmitted backward in time, from a sender in the future to a receiver in the past, through a noisy postselected closed timelike curve (P-CTC) represented by the channel. We completely characterize the one-shot retrocausal quantum and classical capacities of a quantum channel, and we show that the corresponding asymptotic capacities are equal to the average and sum, respectively, of the channel's max-information and its regularized Doeblin information. This endows these information measures with a novel operational interpretation. Furthermore, our characterization can be generalized beyond quantum channels to all completely positive maps. This imposes information-theoretic limits on transmitting messages via postselected-teleportation-like mechanisms with arbitrary initial- and final-state boundary conditions, including those considered in various black-hole final-state models.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing with solid-state spin defects has transformed nanoscale metrology, offering sub-wavelength spatial resolution with exceptional sensitivity to multiple signal types. Maximizing these advantages requires minimizing both the sensor-target separation and detectable signalthreshold. However, leading platforms such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond suffer performance degradation near surfaces or in nanoscale volumes, motivating the search for optically addressable spin sensors in atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present an experimental framework to probe a novel 2D spin ensemble, including its Hamiltonian, coherent sensing dynamics, and noise environment. Using a central spin system in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal, we fully map the hyperfine interactions with proximal nuclear spins, demonstrate programmable switching between magnetic and electric sensing, and introduce a robust method for reconstructing the environmental noise spectrum explicitly accounting for quantum control imperfections. We achieve a record coherence time of 80 $\mu$s and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at a 10 nm target distance, reaching the threshold for detecting a single nuclear spin in nanoscale spectroscopy. Leveraging the broad opportunities for defect engineering in atomically thin hosts, these results lay the foundation for next-generation quantum sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity, tunable noise selectivity, and versatile quantum functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Photon Blockade in Multimode Jaynes-Cummings Models with Two-Photon Dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caden McCollum, Imran M. Mirza</p>
            <p>The photon blockade phenomenon, a promising tool for realizing efficient single-photon sources, is the central focus of our work. We study this phenomenon within the context of the multimode extension of the Jaynes-Cummings model, incorporating two-photon dissipation and external coherent driving. Operating in the weak-driving regime, we confine our analysis to the two-excitation sector of the Hilbert space, initially exploring the single-mode case and then focusing on the corresponding multimode problem. Our study calculates the second-order correlation function (both numerically and analytically) for zero- and nonzero time delays in single- and multimode cases, to pinpoint and validate the conditions that lead to conventional and unconventional photon blockade. Our zero delay findings reveal that photon antibunching is comparable in both cases; however, the multimode case offers a greater degree of control and applicability. Furthermore, for non-zero delay operation, we find that when one of the multiple modes is set at the optimal conventional photon blockade conditions, the behavior of the curve mimics the single-mode problem with an overall slower rate of reaching the $g^{(2)}(\tau)=1$ value. These results highlight the practical implications of our findings for building useful single-photon sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Liang Dong, Peng-Bo Li, Jia-Qiang Chen, Fu-Li Li, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum emitters (QEs) interacting with a photonic structured bath made of bilayer square lattices, where the resonance anti-crossing between the energy bands opens a symmetric middle energy gap. Due to the intrinsic chiral symmetry of the bath and interactions with the square-like band-edges, the QE-photon dressed states generated in this inner bandgap are odd-neighbor, robust, and anisotropic, when the emitters' transition frequencies lie in the middle of the bandgap. We also use giant artificial atoms to engineer and modify the dressed states' patterns. Exotic bound states can lead to spin models with symmetry protection, resulting in fascinating many-body phases. As an example, we show that this proposal can be used to generate both edge states and corner states in the generalized 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This work opens up new avenues for research into innovative quantum many-body physics and quantum simulations with photonic or phononic multilayer structures.</p>

            <p>Chaos is a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics, manifesting as irregular and unpredictable behavior across various physical systems. Among the diverse routes to chaos, intermittent chaos is a distinct transition pathway, characterized by the temporal or spatial alternation between periodic and chaotic motions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, optomechanically induced intermittent chaos in an optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. Specifically, the system evolves from stable periodic oscillation through an intermittent-chaos regime before fully developing into chaotic motion. As system parameters vary, the proportion of chaotic motion in the time-domain increases asymptotically until chaotic dynamics dominates entirely. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that, intermittent chaos can act as noise of a favorable intensity compared with purely periodic or fully chaotic states, and enhance rather than reduce system's responses in nonlinear ultrasonic detection. These findings not only deepen the comprehensive understanding of chaos formation but also broaden its potential applications in high-precision sensing and information processing.</p>

            <p>The sensitivity of non-local optical measurements at low light intensities, such as those involved in long baseline telescope arrays, can be improved by using remote entanglement. Here, we demonstrate the use of entangled quantum memories in a quantum network of Silicon-vacancy centers in diamond nano-cavities to experimentally perform such non-local phase measurements. Specifically, we combine the generation of event-ready remote quantum entanglement, photon mode erasure that hides the "which-path" information of temporally and spatially separated incoming optical modes, and non-local, non-destructive photon heralding enabled by remote entanglement to perform a proof-of-concept entanglement-assisted differential phase measurement of weak incident light between two spatially separate stations. Demonstrating successful operation of the remote phase sensing protocol with a fiber link baseline up to 1.55 km, our results open the door for a new class of quantum enhanced imaging applications.</p>

            <p>Extracting information from weak optical signals is a critical challenge across a broad range of technologies. Conventional imaging techniques, constrained to integrating over detected signals and classical post-processing, are limited in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from shot noise accumulation in the post-processing algorithms. We show that these limitations can be circumvented by coherently encoding photonic amplitude information into qubit registers and applying quantum algorithms to process the stored information from asynchronously arriving optical signals. As a specific example, we develop a quantum algorithm for imaging unresolved point sources and apply it to exoplanet detection. We demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance can be achieved under realistic imaging conditions using relatively small scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters operating at telecom wavelengths are essential for the advancement of quantum technologies, particularly in the development of integrated on-chip devices for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Coupling resonant structures to a near-zero-index (NZI) environment has been shown to enhance their optical performance by both increasing spontaneous emission rates and improving emission directionality. In this work, we comparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell) quantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two different sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the epsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the epsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence lifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a relative emission cone narrowing from 17.6Â° to 10.3Â°. These results underline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the spectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the potential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration into next-generation quantum photonic devices. Due to their CMOS compatibility, fabrication tunability, and high thermal and optical damage thresholds, TCO NZI materials offer a robust platform for scalable and high-performance quantum optical systems operating within the telecom bandwidth.</p>

            <p>We experimentally and theoretically study collective emission of a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a single mode in a nanophotonic microring resonator. Because many cold atoms are localized in a small volume, these trapped atoms collectively couple not only to the guided resonator mode but also to the nonguided modes in free space. Through tuning the atom-photon coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the microring resonator. For photon emission via the nonguided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady state and to the timed-Dicke state, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment. Our observation and methodology could shed light on future explorations of collective emission with densely packed quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic light-matter interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina JÃ¶rg, Michael Fleischhauer</p>
            <p>One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the RÃ©nyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</p>

            <h2>Circuit-Efficient Randomized Quantum Simulation of Non-Unitary Dynamics with Observable-Driven and Symmetry-Aware Designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songqinghao Yang, Jin-Peng Liu</p>
            <p>We introduce random-LCHS, a circuit-efficient randomized-compilation framework for simulating linear non-unitary dynamics of the form $\partial_t u(t) = -A(t) u(t) + b(t)$ built on the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS). We propose three related settings: the general random-LCHS for time-dependent inhomogeneous linear dynamics; the observable-driven random-LCHS, which targets estimation of an observable's expectation at the final time; and the symmetric random-LCHS, a time-independent, homogeneous reduction that can exploit physical symmetries. Our contributions are threefold: first, by randomizing the outer linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) layer as well as the deterministic inner Hamiltonian simulation layer, random-LCHS attains favorable resource overheads in the circuit design for early fault-tolerant devices; second, the observable-driven variant employs an unbiased Monte-Carlo estimator to target expectation values directly, reducing sample complexity; and third, integrating the physical symmetry in the model with the sampling scheme yields further empirical improvements, demonstrating tighter error bounds in realistic numerics. We illustrate these techniques with theoretical guarantees as well as numerical verifications and discuss implementation trade-offs for near-term quantum hardware.</p>

Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer RÃ©nyi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Sekatski, Yelena Guryanova, Naga Bhavya Teja Kothakonda, Michalis Skotiniotis</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of deterministically cloning quantum channels with respect to the best attainable rate and the highest quality, so-called optimal cloning. We demonstrate that cloning quantum states is, in-fact, equivalent to cloning the trash-and-replace channel and therefore the former is a special case of the more general problem. By appealing to higher-order quantum operations (quantum processes) we construct a unified framework to deal with the most general cloning tasks and establish necessary conditions for a family of channels to exhibit super-replication -- a quadratic cloning rate with vanishing error. We find that noisy phase-gate channels satisfy these conditions, and we construct the explicit super-replicating process for the task. Conversely, we find that the criteria are not met by the full set of noisy unitary gates; classical noise channels; or amplitude damping channels, whose respective cloning rates are at most linear. In this paradigm, we not only derive new results, but also refigure known ones. We derive a strong converse for state cloning, and for unitary channels we construct an alternative super-replication process to that of DÃ¼r et al. [PRL 114, 120503 (2015)] and Chiribella et al. [PRL 114, 120504 (2015)] based on a measure-and-prepare process, which allows us to establish a direct connection between optimal channel cloning and Bayesian channel estimation. Finally we give an SDP algorithm to search for optimal cloning processes and study the advantage of coherent vs measure-and-prepare protocols on concrete examples.</p>

            <p>Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.</p>

We achieve joint noise suppression of $4.36 \pm 0.35$ dB below the standard quantum limit at the phase-uncertainty level of $10^{-9}$ . Furthermore, after full optimization in the low-intensity regime, we demonstrate a crossover from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit.

            <p>A distributed network architecture in which flying photons connect individual modules containing stationary atomic qubits is a promising approach for scaling up neutral-atom based quantum-computing platforms. We consider an all-fiber based platform consisting of nanofiber cavity QED systems interconnected via conventional optical fibers. Each nanofiber cavity is strongly coupled to multiple atoms through its evanescent field, and atom pairs within one cavity (local) or two distant cavities (remote) are addressed for performing photon-mediated quantum logic gates on them by controlling the effective light-matter coupling via local AC Stark shifts and atom-fiber distance. We numerically evaluate the required parameters for achieving nearly crosstalk-free gate operation using these targeting methods by calculating average gate fidelities, success probabilities, and Pauli error rates for both local and remote controlled-Z gates. For the case of perfect addressing, we also analytically determine the theoretical optimum gate performance as limited by cavity reflectivity, cooperativity, and qubit level-splitting.</p>

            <p>Topological materials hold great promise for developing next-generation devices with transport properties that remain resilient in the presence of local imperfections. However, their susceptibility to thermal noise has posed a major challenge. In particular, the Haldane model, a cornerstone in topological physics, generally requires cryogenic temperatures for experimental realization, limiting both the investigation of topologically robust quantum phenomena and their practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature realization of the Haldane model using atomic ensembles in momentum-space superradiance lattices, a platform intrinsically resistant to thermal noise. The topological phase transition is revealed through the superradiant emission contrast between two timed Dicke states in the lattice. Crucially, the thermal resilience of this platform allows us to access a deep modulation regime, where topological transitions to high Chern number phases emerge -- going beyond the traditional Haldane model. Our results not only deepen the understanding of exotic topological phases, but also offer a robust, reconfigurable, and room-temperature-compatible platform that connects quantum simulation to real-world quantum technologies.</p>

By encoding a qudit in a basis of light-matter SchrÃ¶dinger's cat states, the loss of a photon in transit can be detected through an $XX$ parity syndrome, allowing the backaction due to the lost photon to be deterministically corrected through single-qubit rotations. The protocol presented here is compatible with existing technologies in both optical and microwave (circuit QED) architectures, supporting near-term implementation across diverse quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>We investigate one- and two-mode variants of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric quantum Rabi model, which describe the interaction of a qutrit with one or two bosonic modes and are directly relevant for circuit-QED and spin-qudit platforms. We find a canonical transformation that allows one to obtain the spectrum of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi model using perturbation theory in a magnetic field. We show that in a certain parameter regime (deep-strong-coupling and a small magnetic field) the three lowest eigenstates become $\mathbb{Z}_3$ qutrit-boson cat states. In order to characterize these states we introduce a joint qutrit-boson Wigner function and derive its closed-form expression for the qutrit-boson cat states. Numerical calculations across a wide range of coupling strengths show that the proposed Wigner function is a useful tool that allows one to unambiguously identify the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ qutrit-boson cat states.</p>

            <h2>No Bound Randomness in Quantum Nonlocality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravishankar Ramanathan, Yuan Liu, Yutian Wu, Stefano Pironio</p>
            <p>Recently it has been found that there exist maximally nonlocal quantum correlations that fail to certify randomness for any fixed input pair, rendering them useless for device-independent spot-checking randomness expansion schemes. Here we show that conversely, in DI randomness amplification protocols where all input pairs are used for randomness generation, any amount of quantum nonlocality is sufficient to certify randomness. This shows that no bound randomness exists in quantum nonlocality - any quantum nonlocal behavior is useful in a DI randomness generation task with appropriate modification of protocol structure. Secondly, we show that in contrast to the hitherto considered fixed-input guessing probability, the average guessing probability over all inputs is a faithful and monotonic measure of nonlocality. We use the average guessing probability to show that in contrast to findings in PRL 134, 090201, the detection efficiency threshold for randomness generation is never lower than that for nonlocality detection. Finally, we analytically compute the average guessing probability by a quantum adversary of a single player's measurement outputs in a standard CHSH Bell test, and use it to demonstrate an improvement in the generation rate in state-of-art amplification protocols.</p>

            <h2>Power and limitations of distributed quantum state purification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benchi Zhao, Yu-Ao Chen, Xuanqiang Zhao, Chengkai Zhu, Giulio Chiribella, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum state purification, which mitigates noise by exploiting multiple noisy copies of unknown states, has applications in quantum communication and computation with imperfect devices. Despite its importance, the fundamental capabilities and limitations of purification in distributed quantum systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically study distributed quantum state purification under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We prove that no nontrivial two-to-one LOCC purification protocol exists for three fundamental sets: all pure states, all maximally entangled states, and the four Bell states. This no-go theorem demonstrates that no LOCC protocol can reduce noise for every state within these sets, even probabilistically. In stark contrast, we show that single-state purification is achievable, and we provide an explicit analytical LOCC protocol for individual target states. For arbitrary state sets, we develop an optimization-based algorithm that systematically designs LOCC purification protocols, demonstrating its efficacy through concrete examples. These results delineate the fundamental boundaries of LOCC-based purification and provide practical strategies for noise reduction in distributed quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Implementing a Universal Set of Geometric Quantum Gates through Dressed-State assisted STA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. EstefanÃ­a Rus, Alejandro FerrÃ³n, Omar Osenda, Sergio S. Gomez</p>
            <p>Geometric quantum computation relies on the geometric phase that arises in adiabatic cyclic evolutions of non-degenerate quantum systems, enabling the design of robust quantum gates. However, the adiabatic condition requires long evolution times, making the system vulnerable to decoherence. In this work, we propose a scheme to realize fast and high-fidelity geometric quantum gates by applying the Superadiabatic Transitionless Driving (SATD) protocol within the dressed-state framework. We analyze the implementation of single-qubit gates in a two-level system driven by a microwave field, focusing in particular on the NV center in diamond. We show how the dynamical phase can be canceled to obtain purely geometric operations. The robustness of the gates is assessed under systematic errors and environmental decoherence, demonstrating high fidelities even in regimes with strong fluctuations. Finally, we extend the protocol to construct nontrivial two-qubit gates, highlighting its feasibility for scalable quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</p>

            <p>Topological phases have been extensively studied over the past two decades, primarily in quantum pure states, where they are protected by exact symmetries. Recently, numerous studies have theoretically demonstrated the existence of average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed quantum states, which naturally arise in real systems due to decoherence or disorder. Despite extensive experimental observations of exact SPT phases in various systems, ranging from solid-state materials to synthetic matters, average SPT phases are yet to be observed until this work. Here we report direct observations of disorder-induced many-body interacting average SPT phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, resulting in fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The induced topological phase is vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice without disorder. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices.</p>

            <h2>Variational Quantum Linear Solver for Simulating Quantum Transport in Nanoscale Semiconductor Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qimao Yang, Jing Guo</p>
            <p>This work develops simulation methods that enable the application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) to simulate quantum transport in nanoscale semiconductor devices. Most previous work on VQLS applications in semiconductor device simulations focuses on solving the Poisson equation, where the coefficient matrix of the sparse linear system is real and symmetric. Solving the quantum transport equation, however, leads to coefficient matrices that are complex and non-symmetric. This work addresses the challenges of applying VQLS to quantum transport simulations. We propose new forms of cost functions to solve complex and non-symmetric linear systems with faster computing speed. We further develop efficient decomposition methods for cost function evaluation, which target reducing the quantum circuit complexity and improving noise robustness when solving the quantum transport equation using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. While classical computation faces the challenge of the "curse of dimensionality" as the spatial-energy numerical grid dimensions grow, the proposed quantum-computing-based method scales logarithmically with the grid size, which offers a promising opportunity for addressing the computational challenges of solving quantum transport in semiconductor devices.</p>

We explore the design space for division, optimize windowed modular exponentiation, and identify the tipping point between multipliers, demonstrating effective applications of resource estimation in quantum research. Additionally, we highlight the impact of parallelization, reset operations, and uncomputation techniques on implementation and resource estimation.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Qi, Yang Peng, Christopher Earls</p>
            <p>Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control. However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover, FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing data from near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Modeling open quantum dynamics without full knowledge of the system Hamiltonian or noise model is a key challenge in quantum control and quantum state estimation. We introduce an Augmented Quantum Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (AQNODE) framework that learns quantum trajectories and dissipation parameters directly from partial continuous measurement data. By embedding the system into a latent space evolved via neural ODEs, AQNODE captures both observable and hidden non-Markovian dynamics with temporal smoothness and physical consistency. Our approach integrates weak measurement data to reconstruct qubit states and time-dependent decoherence rates, enabling accurate state prediction and parameter inference without explicit physical equations. Furthermore, we incorporate AQNODE-based feedback control techniques, including proportional-derivative and time-varying linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies, to steer the quantum system toward target states in real time. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate AQNODE's ability to generalize across system configurations, achieve low prediction errors, and perform robust quantum filtering and control. These results establish AQNODE as a scalable, differentiable, and experimentally compatible framework for real-time modeling and control of dissipative quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Accurately and efficiently predicting the equilibrium geometries of large molecules remains a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, even with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Two major obstacles hinder progress: the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and pharmaceuticals.</p>

            <p>Entanglement distillation, a fundamental building block of quantum networks, enables the purification of noisy entangled states shared among distant nodes by local operations and classical communication. Its practical realization presents several technical challenges, including the storage of quantum states in quantum memory and the execution of coherent quantum operations on multiple copies of states within the quantum memory. In this work, we present an entanglement purification protocol via quantum communication, namely a carrier-assisted entanglement purification protocol, which utilizes two elements only: i) quantum memory for a single-copy entangled state shared by parties and ii) single qubits travelling between parties. We show that the protocol, when single-qubit transmission is noiseless, can purify a noisy entangled state shared by parties. When single-qubit transmission is noisy, the purification relies on types of noisy qubit channels; we characterize qubit channels such that the protocol works for the purification. We resolve the limitation by applying multiple qubits over noisy channels, and show that the purification protocol with multi-carrier qubits works through a noisy qubit channel in general, provided that the channels are not entanglement-breaking, i.e., channels that cannot be constructed as measure-and-prepare operations. Our results significantly reduce the experimental overhead needed for distilling entanglement, such as quantum memory and coherent operations, making long-distance pure entanglement closer to a practical realization.</p>

            <p>We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</p>

In this paradigm of quantum learning, the imaging system functions as a physical learning device that maps input parameters to measurable features, while complex practical tasks are handled by training only the output weights, enabled by the systematic identification of well-estimated features (eigentasks) and their corresponding sample thresholds. Using this framework, we analyze both direct imaging and superresolution strategies for compact sources, defined as sources with sizes bounded below the Rayleigh limit. In particular, we introduce the orthogonalized SPADE method-a nontrivial generalization of existing superresolution techniques-that achieves superior performance when multiple compact sources are closely spaced. This method relaxes the earlier superresolution studies' strong assumption that the entire source must lie within the Rayleigh limit, marking an important step toward developing more general and practically applicable approaches. Using concrete examples involving complex structured sources and classification tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of our orthogonalized SPADE method and highlight key advantages of the quantum learning approach-its ability to tackle complex imaging tasks and enhance performance by selectively extracting well-estimated features.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Sakamoto, Keisuke Fujii</p>
            <p>The simulation of large-scale classical systems in exponentially small space on quantum computers has gained attention. The prior work demonstrated that a quantum algorithm offers an exponential speedup over any classical algorithm in simulating classical dynamics with long-range interactions. However, many real-world classical systems, such as those arising from partial differential equations, exhibit only local interactions. The question remains whether quantum algorithms can still provide exponential speedup under this condition. In this work, we thoroughly characterize the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for simulating such geometrically local systems. First, we dequantize the quantum algorithm for simulating short-time (polynomial-time) dynamics of such systems. This implies that the problem of simulating this dynamics does not yield any exponential quantum advantage. Second, we show that quantum algorithms for short-time dynamics have the same computational complexity as polynomial-time probabilistic classical computation. Third, we show that the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for long-time (exponential-time) dynamics is captured by exponential-time and polynomial-space quantum computation. This suggests a super-polynomial time advantage when restricting the computation to polynomial-space, or an exponential space advantage otherwise. This work offers new insights into the complexity of classical dynamics governed by partial differential equations, providing a pathway for achieving quantum advantage in practical problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carla M. D. Richter, Michael Antesberger, Huan Cao, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema</p>
            <p>In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8328 \pm 0.0045$, which is 18 standard deviations above the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</p>

In this setting, the {\alpha} and z parameters are truly independent from each other. These results also yield an expression for the optimal rate of converting one flat state pair into another.

We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.</p>

            <h2>Cybersecurity of Quantum Key Distribution Implementations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ittay Alfassi, Ran Gelles, Rotem Liss, Tal Mor</p>
            <p>Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) often deviate from the theoretical protocols, exposing the implementations to various attacks even when the underlying (ideal) protocol is proven secure. We present new analysis tools and methodologies for quantum cybersecurity, adapting the concepts of vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and exploits from classical cybersecurity to QKD implementation attacks. We also present three additional concepts, derived from the connection between classical and quantum cybersecurity: "Quantum Fuzzing", which is the first tool for black-box vulnerability research on QKD implementations; "Reversed-Space Attacks", which are a generic exploit method using the attack surface of imperfect receivers; and concrete quantum-mechanical definitions of "Quantum Side-Channel Attacks" and "Quantum State-Channel Attacks", meaningfully distinguishing them from each other and from other attacks. Using our tools, we analyze multiple existing QKD attacks and show that the "Bright Illumination" attack could have been found even with minimal knowledge of the device implementation. This work begins to bridge the gap between current analysis methods for experimental attacks on QKD implementations and the decades-long research in the field of classical cybersecurity, improving the practical security of QKD products and enhancing their usefulness in real-world systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hikaru Wakaura</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning is known as one of the promising applications of quantum computers. Many types of quantum machine learning methods have been released, such as Quantum Annealer, Quantum Neural Network, Variational Quantum Algorithms, and Quantum Reservoir Computers. They can work, consuming far less energy for networks of equivalent size. Quantum Reservoir Computers, in particular, have no limit on the size of input data. However, their accuracy is not enough for practical use, and the effort to improve accuracy is mainly focused on hardware improvements. Therefore, we propose the approach from software called Quantum Reservoir Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which uses Quantum Reservoir Computers as a generator of GAN. We performed the generation of handwritten single digits and monochrome pictures on the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. As a result, Quantum Reservoir GAN is confirmed to be more accurate than Quantum GAN, Classical Neural Network, and ordinary Quantum Reservoir Computers.</p>

            <p>Characterizing multipartite entanglement is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory. The concept of $k$-stretchability [Szalay, Quantum 3, 204 (2019)] provides a framework for describing multipartite entanglement structures.

These criteria identify classes of $k$-nonstretchable states, and their applicability and advantages are demonstrated through explicit examples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zheng, Jin-Shi Xu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries, which are energy-storage or state-storage devices that exploit unique quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here, we demonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery within the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances computational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time parameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find that not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For instance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but its discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing the battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip channels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields low storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel can combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the high-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated charging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging behavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release. These results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental decoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced charging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the spin-chain quantum battery.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Discord of any arbitrary dimensional bipartite system and its application in quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashi Jain, Satyabrata Adhikari</p>
            <p>Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ in terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. The lower bound of $K_D$ depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$ are the density matrices. We find that for a certain range of GQD, the successful generation of the secret key is not guaranteed. We further study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples. Moreover, we find that even when $\sigma_i$'s are separable or positive partial transpose entangled states, the distillable key can still be generated.</p>

            <h2>Another generalization of Hadamard test: Optimal sample complexities for learning functions on the unitary group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Suruga</p>
            <p>Estimating properties of unknown unitary operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. While full unitary tomography requires a number of samples to the unknown unitary scaling linearly with the dimension (implying exponentially with the number of qubits), estimating specific functions of a unitary can be significantly more efficient. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the sample-efficient estimation of arbitrary square integrable functions $f: \mathbf{U}(d) \to \mathbb{C}$, using only access to the controlled-unitary operation. We first provide a tight characterization of the optimal sample complexity when the accuracy is measured by the averaged bias over the unitary $\mathbf{U}(d)$. We then construct a sample-efficient estimation algorithm that becomes optimal under the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning criterion for various classes of functions. Applications include optimal estimation of matrix elements of irreducible representations, the trace, determinant, and general polynomial functions on $\mathbf{U}(d)$. Our technique generalize the Hadamard test and leverage tools from representation theory, yielding both lower and upper bound on sample complexity.</p>

            <p>High-fidelity native multi-qubit operations are crucial to efficient quantum circuit compilation due to their ability of shortening circuit depth and enhence the performance. However, the design and implementation of these gates remain a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a hardware-efficient scalable scheme for direct CCZ gate implementation based on two-photon absorption phenomenon, which is applicable to current superconducting quantumcomputing platforms. By carefully optimizing the parameters of qubits and couplers, we achieve a simulated fidelity over 99% within 194ns, surpassing the decomposed methods with single-qubit and two-qubit gates in both latency and overall fidelity. Crucially, the scheme is robust against parameter drifts and can be extended to CCPhase({\theta}) gates with arbitrary angles and multi-qubit operations. All these results highlight the advantages of our scheme which paves the way for substantial depth compression of complex quantum circuits for practical application in transformative quantum algorithms and simulations.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Fault-Tolerant Surface Code Decoding with Iterative Lattice Reweighting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Tian, Y. Zheng, Xiaoting Wang, Ching-Yi Lai</p>
            <p>Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder, which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting: correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq 17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding. Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$, IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a major reduction in qubit overhead.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jop BriÃ«t, Matthias Christandl, Itai Leigh, Amir Shpilka, Jeroen Zuiddam</p>
            <p>Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers, often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets, sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of such tensor parameters. We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field (and in fact any finite set of coefficients in any field), the asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points, and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation points. Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound says that any concise three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank. Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions. We prove that for any concise tensor, the product of any two such maximum ranks must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions with large max-rank.</p>

            <p>The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is arguably the most popular noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era approach to quantum chemistry. We consider the underexplored quantum annealing eigensolver (QAE) algorithm as a worthy alternative. We use a combination of numerical calculations for a system where strong correlation effects dominate, and conclusions drawn from our preliminary scaling analysis for QAE and VQE to make the case for QAE as a NISQ era contender to VQE for quantum chemistry. For the former, we pick the representative example of computing avoided crossings in the H4 molecule in a rectangular geometry, and demonstrate that we obtain results to within about 1.2% of the full configuration interaction value on the D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Following our numerical results, we carry out a detailed yet preliminary analysis of the scaling behaviours of both the QAE and the VQE algorithms. We analyze the non-recurring and recurring costs involved in both the algorithms and arrive at their net scaling behaviours.</p>

            <h2>Practical Fidelity Limits of Toffoli Gates in Superconducting Quantum Processors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. AbuGhanem</p>
            <p>High-fidelity multi-qubit gates are a critical resource for near-term quantum computing, as they underpin the execution of both quantum algorithms and fault-tolerant protocols. The Toffoli gate (CCNOT), in particular, plays a central role in quantum error correction and quantum arithmetic, yet its efficient implementation on current quantum hardware remains limited by noise and connectivity constraints. In this work, we present a hardware-aware characterization of the Toffoli gate using optimized, connectivity-compliant decompositions executed on IBM's 127-qubit superconducting quantum processors. Our study integrates state preparation, gate synthesis, and quantum state/process tomography (QST/QPT) to evaluate fidelity across three distinct classes of input states: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), W, and the uniform superposition of all three-qubit computational basis states -- under noise-free simulation, noise-aware emulation, and real hardware execution. For GHZ states, we report state fidelities of 98.442% (noise-free simulation), 81.470% (noise-aware quantum emulation), and 56.368% (real quantum hardware). For W states, state fidelities are 98.739%, 79.900%, and 63.689%, respectively, and for the uniform superposition state, we observe state fidelities of 99.490%, 85.469%, and 61.161%. Comparative QPT experiments yield process fidelities of 98.976% (noise-free) and 80.160% (noise-aware emulation). Our results empirically characterize state-dependent error patterns in multi-qubit circuits and quantify trade-offs between gate decomposition strategies and native hardware performance, offering practical insights for scalable, hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.</p>

            <p>The direct compilation of algorithm-specific graph states in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) can lead to resource reductions in terms of circuit depth, entangling gates, and even the number of physical qubits. In this work, we extend previous studies on algorithm-tailored graph states to periodic sequences of generalized Pauli rotations, which commonly appear in, e.g., Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation. We first implement an enhanced simulated-annealing-based algorithm to find optimal periodic graph states within local-Clifford (LC-)MBQC. In addition, we derive a novel scheme for the preparation of resource states based on a graph state and a ladder of CNOT gates, which we term anticommutation-based (AC-)MBQC, since it uncovers a direct relationship between the graph state and the anticommutation matrix for the set of Hamilonians generating the computation. We also deploy our two approaches to derive universal resource states from minimal universal sets of generating Hamiltonians, thus providing a straightforward algorithm for finding the former. Finally, we demonstrate and compare both of our methods based on various examples from condensed matter physics and universal quantum computation.</p>

By engineering a spectral notch at neighboring resonator frequencies, the method effectively mitigates spurious signal interference. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing readout architectures, enabling fast, low-crosstalk multiplexed measurements without additional hardware overhead -- a critical advancement for scalable quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using four-wave mixing in a double-{\Lambda} configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.</p>

            <p>Dense and shallow ensembles of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV$^-$) with good optical and spin properties play a key role in the performance enhancement of diamond-based quantum sensors. Ion implantation enables precise control of NV$^-$ depth and density. However, at high ion fluence, this method is limited by low NV$^-$ creation yields and sample amorphization. Additionally, shallow NV$^-$ spin properties deteriorate due to surface proximity. In this paper, we study N$_2^+$ ion implantation at energies between 10 and 15 keV with fluences as high as 1e15 ions/cm2 at temperatures of 20, 400 and 800Â°C to investigate the influence of implantation temperature on lattice damage, NV$^-$ creation yield and NV$^-$ spin properties. Our results show that diamond maintains structural integrity at 800Â°C with fluences up to 1e15 ions/cm2 without amorphization. Furthermore, high-temperature implantation improves NV$^-$ creation yields up to five times without compromising T2$^*$, T2 and T1, making it a promising approach to enhance the magnetic field sensitivity of NV$^-$ ensembles.</p>

            <p>The multimode ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime has emerged as a novel platform for accessing previously inaccessible phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Of particular interest are cavity-mediated correlations between local and nonlocal excitations, or equivalently, between modes at zero and finite in-plane momentum modes, which offer new opportunities for controlling light--matter interactions across space. However, direct experimental evidence of such interactions has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal multimode coupling in a Landau polariton system, where cavity photons simultaneously interact with the zero-momentum cyclotron resonance and finite-momentum magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional electron gas in a GaAs quantum well. Our slot cavities, with their subwavelength mode volumes, supply in-plane momentum components that enable the excitation of finite-momentum matter modes. Terahertz time-domain magnetospectroscopy measurements reveal a clear splitting of the upper-polariton branch, arising from hybridization between magnetoplasmon modes and the cavity--cyclotron-resonance hybrids. Extracted coupling strengths confirm USC of the cyclotron resonance and strong coupling of the magnetoplasmon modes to the cavity field, respectively.

            <h2>Quantum Theory of Distributed-Feedback Parametric Amplifiers and Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex O.C. Davis, Alex I. Flint</p>
            <p>Optical parametric amplifiers and oscillators are among the best-developed quantum light sources, having already been adopted in precision measurement and underpinning various quantum computing and communication paradigms. Meanwhile, progress in photonic structures such as Bragg gratings has enabled distributed feedback oscillators to become widely established as classical laser sources with desirable properties. Recent work in fabricating and processing photonic structures in nonlinear media opens the path to combining these two programs to realize distributed feedback parametric oscillators. Such devices have great potential as sources of quantum light, especially for squeezed vacuum, a crucial resource state in emerging quantum technologies. In this study, an analytic and fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics of such devices is presented. This approach gives explicit results for the key properties of these sources, including the parametric oscillation pump threshold, intracavity mode, tunability, and quantum statistics of the output modes. These results underpin future work on a versatile class of next-generation quantum light source.</p>

            <h2>Quantum optics in the turbulent atmosphere: Fundamental issues and applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Semenov, M. Klen, I. Pechonkin</p>
            <p>Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT, validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.</p>

            <h2>High-order Magnus Expansion for Hamiltonian Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Fang, Diyi Liu, Shuchen Zhu</p>
            <p>Efficient simulation of quantum dynamics with time-dependent Hamiltonians is important not only for time-varying systems but also for time-independent Hamiltonians in the interaction picture. Such simulations are more challenging than their time-independent counterparts due to the complexity introduced by time ordering. Existing algorithms that aim to capture commutator-based scaling either exhibit polynomial cost dependence on the Hamiltonian's time derivatives or are limited to low-order accuracy. In this work, we establish the general commutator-scaling error bounds for the truncated Magnus expansion at arbitrary order, where only Hamiltonian terms appear in the nested commutators, with no time derivatives involved. Building on this analysis, we design a high-order quantum algorithm with explicit circuit constructions. The algorithm achieves cost scaling with the commutator structure in the high-precision regime and depends only logarithmically on the Hamiltonian's time variation, making it efficient for general time-dependent settings, including the interaction picture.</p>

            <p>Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computation with classical Machine Learning (ML) and holds the potential to achieve the quantum advantage for specific tasks. In classical ML, Machine Unlearning (MU) is a crucial strategy for removing the influence of specified training data from a model, to meet regulatory requirements and mitigate privacy risks. However, both the risk of training-data membership leakage remains underexplored in QML. This motivates us to propose Quantum Machine Unlearning (QMU) to explore two core questions: do QML models require MU due to training-data membership leakage, and can MU mechanisms be efficiently implemented in the QML? To answer the two questions, we conducted experiments on the MNIST classification task, utilizing a class-wise unlearning paradigm in both noiseless simulations and quantum hardware. First, we quantify training-data privacy leakage using a Membership Inference Attack (MIA), observing average success rates of 90.2\% in noiseless simulations and 75.3\% on quantum hardware. These results indicate that QML models present training-data membership leakage with very high probability under adversarial access, motivating the need for MU. Second, we implement MU algorithms on the QML model, which reduces the average MIA success rate to 0\% in simulations and 3.7\% on quantum hardware while preserving accuracy on retained data. We conclude that implementing MU mechanisms in QML models renders them resistant to MIA. Overall, this paper reveals significant privacy vulnerabilities in QML models and provides effective corresponding defense strategies, providing a potential path toward privacy-preserving QML systems.</p>

            <h2>The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuowei Ma, Junyu Liu</p>
            <p>Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states, enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight $w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Advanced quantum technologies rely on non-Gaussian states of light, essential for universal quantum computation, fault-tolerant error correction, and quantum sensing. Their practical realization, however, faces hurdles: simulating large multi-mode generators is computationally demanding, and benchmarks such as the \emph{stellar rank} do not capture how effectively photon detections yield useful non-Gaussianity. We address these challenges by introducing the \emph{non-Gaussian control parameters} $(s_0,\delta_0)$, a continuous and operational measure that goes beyond stellar rank. Leveraging these parameters, we develop a universal optimization method that reduces photon-number requirements and greatly enhances success probabilities while preserving state quality. Applied to the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) state generation, for example, our method cuts the required photon detections by a factor of three and raises the preparation probability by nearly $10^8$. Demonstrations across cat states, cubic phase states, GKP states, and even random states confirm broad gains in experimental feasibility. Our results provide a unifying principle for resource-efficient non-Gaussian state generation, charting a practical route toward scalable optical quantum technologies and fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Single-Shot Decoding of Biased-Tailored Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devon Campbell</p>
            <p>Quantum processors are often affected by biased noise and noisy readout, which reduce reliability and reproducibility. This work combines two complementary strategies to address these challenges. The first is bias tailoring, which aligns stabilizers with the dominant error type. The second is single-shot (SS) decoding, which uses metachecks to identify measurement faults from just one noisy round. We implement these ideas in a four-dimensional lifted hypergraph product (4D-LHP) code constructed from quasi-cyclic protograph seeds. Simulation results show that bias tailoring lowers the word-error rate (WER) by 20-60 percent across realistic Z:X bias ratios (from 1:1 up to 1000:1), with the largest improvements at moderate bias. When measurement noise is present, a single SS round recovers more than one third of the performance lost to readout errors. Moreover, metachecks identify over 99.8 percent of faulty syndromes, providing near-complete fault visibility even with limited correction power. Together, these findings demonstrate that 4D-LHP codes maintain strong resilience under realistic noise, making them promising candidates for integration into orchestrated QPU-CPU workflows.</p>

            <p>Residual cross-talk in superconducting qubit devices creates a security vulnerability for emerging quantum cloud services. We demonstrate a Clifford-only Quantum Rowhammer attack-using just X and CNOT gates-that injects faults on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processors without requiring pulse-level access. Experiments show that targeted hammering induces localized errors confined to the attack cycle and primarily manifests as phase noise, as confirmed by near 50% flip rates under Hadamard-basis probing. A full lattice sweep maps QR's spatial and temporal behavior, revealing reproducible corruption limited to qubits within two coupling hops and rapid recovery in subsequent benign cycles. Finally, we leverage these properties to outline a prime-and-probe covert channel, demonstrating that the clear separability between hammered and benign rounds enables highly reliable signaling without error correction. These findings underscore the need for hardware-level isolation and scheduler-aware defenses as multi-tenant quantum computing becomes standard.</p>

            <p>Engineered dissipation is emerging as an alternative tool for quantum state control, enabling high-fidelity preparation, transfer and stabilization, and access to novel phase transitions. We realize a tunable, state-resolved laser-induced loss channel for individual Rydberg atoms, in both non-interacting and strongly correlated settings. This capability allows us to reveal interaction-driven shifts of the exceptional point separating quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes, and to demonstrate interaction-enhanced decay. By exploiting interaction-dependent energy level shifts, we observe a configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect that freezes target spin states. We theoretically show that when this mechanism is extended to many-body chains it allows for the dissipative distillation of unwanted spin configurations. These experimental studies establish a versatile approach for exploring strongly interacting, open quantum spin systems, and opens possible new routines for dissipative preparation of correlated quantum states in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>The degradation of entanglement in quantum memories due to decoherence is a critical challenge for scalable quantum networks. We present an entanglement distillation protocol based on the [[4,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code, deriving analytical expressions for its output fidelity and yield, and benchmarking it against the BBPSSW protocol. In addition to initial distillation, we investigate a re-distillation strategy in which stored logical entangled states are refreshed using only local operations and classical communication, avoiding the need to regenerate and redistribute entanglement from scratch. Our analysis shows that this method can extend the effective storage lifetime beyond BBPSSW,with its performance advantage primarily determined by classical communication delay. We derive upper bounds on classical communication latency required for the approach to maintain superiority. This work introduces a framework for treating quantum memories as reusable resources and links distillation strategy to practical implementation constraints, offering quantitative guidance for designing resilient quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computations require alternating quantum and classical computations, where the classical computations prove vital in detecting and correcting errors in the quantum computation. Recently, interest in using these classical computations has been growing again, not to correct errors, but to perform computations. Various works have looked into these so-called adaptive quantum algorithms. Few works however have looked in the advantages of adaptive quantum algorithms in realistic scenarios. This work provides the first step in this direction. We introduce a worst-case noise model and use it to derive success probabilities for preparing a GHZ state and preparing a $W$-state using either an adaptive quantum algorithm, or using a standard non-adaptive quantum algorithm. Next, we implemented these protocols on quantum hardware and we compare the outcomes to our derived theoretical results. We find that despite their potential, adaptive quantum algorithms currently do not outperform full quantum algorithms.</p>

By carefully optimizing the parameters of qubits and couplers, we achieve a simulated fidelity over 99% within 194ns, surpassing the decomposed methods with single-qubit and two-qubit gates in both latency and overall fidelity. Crucially, the scheme is robust against parameter drifts and can be extended to CCPhase({\theta}) gates with arbitrary angles and multi-qubit operations. All these results highlight the advantages of our scheme which paves the way for substantial depth compression of complex quantum circuits for practical application in transformative quantum algorithms and simulations.</p>

The measured dependencies of SiV- PL lifetime and intensity on excitation wavelength, together with the enhancement dependence on Ns concentration in the studied nanodiamonds, provide unambiguous evidence of the involvement of donor nitrogen in SiV-emission dynamics. Saturation curves and second-order PL intensity correlation measurements further indicate suppression of the population of the optically inactive SiV2- state upon the addition of green excitation.

            <p>Perfect transfer of unknown states across distinct nodes is fundamental in the construction of bosonic quantum networks. We here develop a general theory to control an $N$-node bosonic network governed by the time-dependent Hamiltonian, as the universal quantum control theory for continuous-variable systems. In particular, we can activate nonadiabatic passages superposed of initial and target modes by the commutation condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the representation of time-independent ancillary modes, which serves as the necessary and sufficient condition to solve the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation of the entire network. To exemplify the versatility of our theory on the Heisenberg-picture passages, we perform arbitrary state exchange between two nodes, chiral NOON-state transfer among three bosonic nodes, and chiral Fock-state transfer among three of four bosonic nodes. Our work provides a promising avenue toward universal control of any pair of nodes or modes in bosonic networks as well as the whole network.</p>

            <h2>Construction of PPT entangled state and its detection by using second-order moment of the partial transposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Kumar, Satyabrata Adhikari</p>
            <p>In this work, we adopt a formalism by which we construct a new family of positive partial transpose (PPT) states, which includes separable and PPT entangled states (PPTES) in a $d_{1}\otimes d_{2}$ dimensional system and then derive a condition that can distinguish between them. The PPT condition is expressed in terms of the inequality between the second-order moment of the system's partial transposition $(p_2)$ and the reciprocal of the product of $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$. The second order moment $(p_{2})$ plays a vital role in detecting the PPT states as it is very easy to calculate and may be a realizable quantity in an experiment. Once we know that the given state is a PPT state, we will use a suitable witness operator to detect whether the given PPT state is a PPTES. Further, we have established a relation between the second and third order moments of partial transposition of a PPT state and have shown that the violation of the inequality implies that the detected state is a negative partial transpose (NPT) entangled state. We will then construct a quantum state by considering the mixture of a separable and an entangled state and obtain a condition on the mixing parameter for which the mixture represents a PPT entangled state. We observe that the resulting PPT entangled state may also be detected by the same witness operator $W$, which had detected the entangled state present in the mixture. Finally, applying our results, we have shown that the distillable key rate of the private state, prepared through our prescription, is positive. It suggests that our result also has potential applications in quantum cryptography.</p>

In particular, we argue that reformulating the Bohmian guiding equation so as to extend our results on the particle speed to the trajectory level yields a convergence between the predictions of Bohmian mechanics and standard quantum mechanics for tunnelling and related phenomena. Our findings therefore challenge Bohmian mechanics to justify or revise its reliance on the standard guiding equation-an issue that has so far not been addressed.</p>

            <p>The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model, as the simplest realization of a lattice gauge theory, exhibits rich and unconventional physics. One of its most remarkable features is disorder-free localization, where localization emerges not from explicit quenched disorder but from static background $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges, leading to persistent memory of the initial state. In this work, we investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum dissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained more robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This dissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of initial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned configurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with decoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for stabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We address the problem of implementing bottleneck layers from classical pre-trained neural networks on a quantum computer, with the goal of achieving quantum advantage on near-term devices. Our approach begins with a compression step in which the target linear layer is represented as an effective matrix product operator (MPO) without degrading model performance. The MPO is then further disentangled into a more compact form. This enables a hybrid classical-quantum execution scheme, where the disentangling circuits are deployed on a quantum computer while the remainder of the network -- including the disentangled MPO -- runs on classical hardware. We introduce two complementary algorithms for MPO disentangling: (i) an explicitly disentangling variational method leveraging standard tensor-network optimization techniques, and (ii) an implicitly disentangling gradient-descent-based approach. We validate these methods through a proof-of-concept translation of simple classical neural networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification into a hybrid classical-quantum form.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Tian, Yi-Cong Zheng, Xiaoting Wang, Ching-Yi Lai</p>
            <p>Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder, which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting: correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq 17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding. Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$, IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a major reduction in qubit overhead.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingze Qiu</p>
            <p>The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the asymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the near-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful toolkit for its application.</p>

While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew B. Hastings</p>
            <p>We introduce a class of cyclic quantum codes, basing the construction not on the simplicity of the stabilizers, but rather on the simplicity of preparation of a code state (at least in the absence of noise). We show how certain known codes, such as a certain family of rotated two-dimensional toric codes, fall into this class, and we also give certain other examples at small sizes found by computer search. We finally discuss fault tolerant preparation of these codes.</p>

            <h2>Learning spatially structured open quantum dynamics with regional-attention transformers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dounan Du, Eden Figueroa</p>
            <p>Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control is an important challenge in quantum information science. Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design, real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across diverse light-matter platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. De Lorenzis, M. P. Casado, N. Lo Gullo, T. Lux, F. Plastina, A. Riera</p>
            <p>In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has grown rapidly, emerging as a promising approach to make quantum computing implementation competitive. In this work, we investigate Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELM), a quantum variant of Extreme Learning Machines where training is restricted to the output layer. The proposed architecture combines dimensionality reduction (via PCA or Autoencoders), quantum state encoding, evolution under an XX Hamiltonian, and measurement, providing features for a single-layer classifier. By analyzing the performance of QELMs as a function of the evolution time, we identify a relatively sharp transition from a low-accuracy to a high-accuracy regime, after which the accuracy saturates. Remarkably, the saturation value matches that achieved with random unitaries, which induce maximally complex dynamics and optimally scramble information across the system. Across all cases studied, the critical transition time is sufficient for information to reach nearest neighbors, enabling feature extraction for learning, and is independent of the system size (i.e., the number of qubits). This independence implies that QELMs can be efficiently simulated classically for a broad class of tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artem Rozanov, Boris Bantysh, Ivan Bobrov, Gleb Struchalin, Stanislav Straupe</p>
            <p>We present benchmarking results for single-qubit gates implemented on a neutral atom quantum processor using Direct Randomized Benchmarking (DRB) and Gate Set Tomography (GST). The DRB protocol involves preparing stabilizer states, applying $m$ layers of native single-qubit gates, and measuring in the computational basis, providing an efficient error characterization under a stochastic Pauli noise model. GST enables the full, self-consistent reconstruction of quantum processes, including gates, input states, and measurements. Both protocols provide robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors estimations of gate performance, offering complementary perspectives on quantum gate fidelity. For single-qubit gates, DRB yields an average fidelity of $99.963 \pm 0.016\%$. The protocol was further applied to a 25-qubit array under global single-qubit control. GST results are consistent with those obtained via DRB. We also introduce a gauge optimization procedure for GST that brings the reconstructed gates, input states, and measurements into a canonical frame, enabling meaningful fidelity comparisons while preserving physical constraints. These constraints of the operators -- such as complete positivity and trace preservation -- are enforced by performing the optimization over the Stiefel manifold. The combined analysis supports the use of complementary benchmarking techniques for characterizing scalable quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are versatile quantum sensors with broad applications in the physical and life sciences. The concentration of neutral substitutional nitrogen ([N$_\text{s}^0$]) strongly influences coherence times, sensitivity, and optimal sensing strategies. Diamonds with [N$_\text{s}^0$] $\sim\,1-10\,\text{ppm}$ are a focus of recent material engineering efforts, with higher concentrations being favorable for continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) and lower concentrations expected to benefit pulsed magnetometry techniques through extended NV electronic spin coherence times and improved sensing duty cycles. In this work, we synthesize and characterize low-[N$_\text{s}^0$] ($\sim\,0.8\,\text{ppm}$), NV-enriched diamond material, engineered through low-strain chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth on high-quality substrates, $^{12}$C isotopic purification, and controlled electron irradiation and annealing. Our results demonstrate good strain homogeneity in diamonds grown on CVD substrates and spin-bath-limited NV dephasing times. By measuring NV spin and charge properties across a wide range of optical NV excitation intensity, we provide direct comparisons of photon-shot-noise-limited magnetic sensitivity between the current low-[$\text{N}_\text{s}^0$] and previously studied higher-[$\text{N}_\text{s}^0$] ($\sim\,14\,\text{ppm}$) NV-diamond sensors. We show that low-[N$_\text{s}^0$] diamond can outperform higher-[N$_\text{s}^0$] diamond at moderate and low optical NV excitation intensity. Our results provide practical benchmarks and guidance for selecting NV-diamond sensors tailored to specific experimental constraints and sensing requirements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichang Hao, Wei Jie Chan, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>Rich phenomenology emerges at the intersection of non-Hermiticity and many-body dynamics, yet physically realizable implementations remain challenging. In this work, we propose a general formalism that maps non-Hermitian many-body Hamiltonians to the Laplacians of Markov chains, such that wavefunction amplitudes are re-interpreted as stochastic many-body configuration probabilities. Despite explicitly preserving all state transition processes and inheriting analogous non-Hermitian localization and state-space fragmentation, our Markov chain processes exhibit distinct steady-state behavior independently of energetic considerations that govern quantum evolution. We demonstrate our framework with two contrasting representative scenarios, one involving asymmetric (biased) propagation with exclusion interactions, and the other involving flipping pairs of adjacent spins (agents). These results reveal robust and distinctive signatures of non-Hermitian phenomena in classical stochastic settings such as ecological and social networks, and provide a versatile framework for studying non-reciprocal many-body dynamics across and beyond physics.</p>

            <p>We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the RÃ©nyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</p>

            <p>The degradation of classical and quantum structured light induced by complex media constitutes a critical barrier to its practical implementation in a range of applications, from communication and energy transport to imaging and sensing. Atmospheric turbulence is an exemplary case due to its complex phase structure and dynamic variations, driving the need to find invariances in light. Here we construct classical and quantum optical skyrmions and pass them through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded topological resilience of their structure. In the quantum realm, we show that while skyrmions undergo diminished entanglement, their topological characteristics maintain stable. This is paralleled classically, where the vectorial structure is scrambled by the medium yet the skyrmion remains stable by virtue of its intrinsic topological protection mechanism. Our experimental results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling, validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour is due to the non-separability of the states and one-sided nature of the channel. Our work blurs the classical-quantum divide in the context of topology and opens a new path to information resilience in noisy channels, such as terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication networks.</p>

            <p>We revisit the thermal nature of the Unruh effect within a quantum thermodynamic framework. For a Unruh-deWitt (UDW) detector in $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that its irreversible thermalization to a Gibbs equilibrium state follows distinct trajectories on the Bloch sphere, which depend on the types of fields the detector interacts with, as well as the spacetime dimensionality. Using thermodynamic process functions, particularly quantum coherence and heat that form the quantum First Law, we characterize the Unruh thermalization through a complementary time evolution between the trajectory-dependent rates of process functions. Grounded in information geometry, we further explore the kinematics of the detector state as it "flows" along the trajectory. In particular, we propose two heating/cooling protocols for the UDW detector undergoing Unruh thermalization. We observe a quantum Mpemba-like effect, characterized by faster heating than cooling in terms of Uhlmann fidelity "distance" change. Most significantly, we establish the maximum fidelity difference as a novel diagnostic that essentially distinguishes between Unruh thermalization and its classical counterpart, i.e., classical thermal bath-driven thermalization of an inertial UDW detector. This compelling criterion may serve as a hallmark of the quantum origin of the Unruh effect in future experimental detection and quantum simulation. Finally, we conclude with a general analysis of Unruh thermalization, starting from equal-fidelity non-thermal states, and demonstrate that the detectors' fidelity and "speed" of quantum evolution still exhibit a Mpemba-like behavior.</p>

In simulations with a $170^{\circ} {\rm C}$ $^{85}$Rb beam and an interferometer arm length of 100~mm, the approach achieves sensitivities of $3{\rm \mu m / s^2 / \sqrt{Hz}}$ (velocity random walk) and $15{\rm \mu deg / \sqrt{h}}$ (angular random walk), surpassing state-of-the-art inertial sensors.</p>

            <p>We introduce a quasiclassical Green function approach describing the unitary yet irreversible dynamics of quantum systems effectively acting as their own environment. Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory, notably the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G \Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in regimes of strong entanglement.</p>

            <p>We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model, which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number. Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic signature of a topological (trivial) phase.</p>

The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.</p>

Anomalous tunneling, which means low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential, has been theoretically predicted as a characteristic phenomenon of BECs. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy region and experimentally measure their frequencies, finding that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling.

            <p>Electron irradiation and annealing treatments are a method of colour centre/defect creation in diamond. The depth profile of defects created by low energy 200 keV electrons in single crystal high purity (type II) electronic grade diamond grown via chemical vapour deposition has been investigated. The depth profile of monovacancies created was found, using photoluminescence (PL), to decay exponentially, with decay length $12\pm1$ $\mu$m and production rate of $(1.1\pm0.2)\times 10 ^{-1}$ V/e$^{-}$/cm at the surface. The depth distribution of the neutral and negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^{0/-}$) centre, and the 733 nm zero phonon line defect formed during an isochronal annealing study have also been investigated by PL. The observed NV profiles, which do not match the vacancy profiles, can be qualitatively explained in terms of a simple model that includes the formation of vacancy clusters and the nitrogen-divacancy (NV$_{2}$) defect. The production of (NV$^{0/-}$) has been assumed to be nitrogen limited, but this paper has shown that this is not the case, with NVs lost to the production of NV$_{2}$ when the concentration of vacancies greatly exceeds that of substitutional nitrogen.</p>

            <h2>Super-Quadratic Quantum Speed-ups and Guessing Many Likely Keys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Glaser, Alexander May, Julian Nowakowski</p>
            <p>We study the fundamental problem of guessing cryptographic keys, drawn from some non-uniform probability distribution $D$, as e.g. in LPN, LWE or for passwords. The optimal classical algorithm enumerates keys in decreasing order of likelihood. The optimal quantum algorithm, due to Montanaro (2011), is a sophisticated Grover search. We give the first tight analysis for Montanaro's algorithm, showing that its runtime is $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$, where $H_{\alpha}(\cdot)$ denotes Renyi entropy with parameter $\alpha$. Interestingly, this is a direct consequence of an information theoretic result called Arikan's Inequality (1996) -- which has so far been missed in the cryptographic community -- that tightly bounds the runtime of classical key guessing by $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$. Since $H_{2/3}(D) < H_{1/2}(D)$ for every non-uniform distribution $D$, we thus obtain a super-quadratic quantum speed-up $s>2$ over classical key guessing. As another main result, we provide the first thorough analysis of guessing in a multi-key setting. Specifically, we consider the task of attacking many keys sampled independently from some distribution $D$, and aim to guess a fraction of them. For product distributions $D = \chi^n$, we show that any constant fraction of keys can be guessed within $2^{H(D)}$ classically and $2 ^{H(D)/2}$ quantumly per key, where $H(\chi)$ denotes Shannon entropy. In contrast, Arikan's Inequality implies that guessing a single key costs $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$ classically and $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$ quantumly. Since $H(D) < H_{2/3}(D) < H_{1/2}(D)$, this shows that in a multi-key setting the guessing cost per key is substantially smaller than in a single-key setting, both classically and quantumly.</p>

Focusing on scalar theories with higher-dimensional operators, we compute the finite-temperature entropy using thermal field theory techniques. We argue that consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles-specifically, the expectation that entropy increases with the introduction of new degrees of freedom-imposes nontrivial constraints on Wilson coefficients. In particular, we show that the coefficient of the leading dimension-8 operator must be strictly positive. This thermodynamic perspective offers an alternative to traditional S-matrix-based derivations of positivity bounds and provides fresh insight into the interplay between entropy, unitarity, and causality in quantum field theory.</p>

            <p>We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's surface, we imposed a generalized Robin boundary condition. Our analysis demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to probe the $\xi$ coupling.</p>

            <h2>Tensor Network based Gene Regulatory Network Inference for Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olatz Sanz Larrarte, Borja Aizpurua, Reza Dastbasteh, Ruben M. Otxoa, Josu Etxezarreta Martinez</p>
            <p>Deciphering complex gene-gene interactions remains challenging in transcriptomics as traditional methods often miss higher-order and nonlinear dependencies. This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing. This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and precision medicine.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Powell, Louis Buchalter</p>
            <p>We present an analysis of a square-lattice Harper-Hofstadter model with a periodically varying magnetic flux with time. By switching the dimensionless flux per plaquette between a set of values $\{p_j/q_j\}$ the Floquet quasienergy spectrum is folded into Q = lcm$\{q_j\}$ bands. We determine closed form analytical solutions for the quasienergy spectrum and Chern numbers for the -1/2 $\to$ 1/2 flux switching case, as well as the Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin (RLBL) winding invariants W numerically, and construct the corresponding topological phase diagram for arbitrary driving period. We find that generic flux-switching drives feature interlaced Hofstadter butterfly quasienergy spectra, and the gaps in the spectrum may be labeled according to a Diophantine equation which relates the quasienergy gap index to the fluxes attained in the drive and their associated per-step windings.</p>

            <p>We investigated the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model across clean and disordered regimes using exact numerical technique of a four-site lattice under Lindblad dynamics with local dephasing noise. By systematically varying hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and random disorder, we probe relaxation dynamics toward a common steady state using trace distance, relative entropy, entanglement asymmetry, and $\ell_1$-norm of coherence metrics. Our results reveal that QME emerges prominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive nonlinear relaxation pathways, enabling initially distant states to overtake closer ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization, whereas Stark potentials and random disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to the pronounced effects of Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry proves to be particularly sensitive to the symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME. These findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum state smoothing is a technique for assigning a valid quantum state to a partially observed dynamical system, using measurement records both prior and posterior to an estimation time. We show that the technique is greatly simplified for Linear Gaussian quantum systems, which have wide physical applicability. We derive a closed-form solution for the quantum smoothed state, which is more pure than the standard filtered state, whilst still being described by a physical quantum state, unlike other proposed quantum smoothing techniques. We apply the theory to an on-threshold optical parametric oscillator, exploring optimal conditions for purity recovery by smoothing. The role of quantum efficiency is elucidated, in both low and high efficiency limits.</p>

            <h2>Gaussian decomposition of magic states for matchgate computations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Cudby, Sergii Strelchuk</p>
            <p>Magic states, pivotal for universal quantum computation via classically simulable Clifford gates, often undergo decomposition into resourceless stabilizer states, facilitating simulation through classical means. This approach yields three operationally significant metrics: stabilizer rank, fidelity, and extent. We extend these simulation methods to encompass matchgate circuits (MGCs), and define equivalent metrics for this setting. We begin with an investigation into the algebraic constraints defining Gaussian states, marking the first explicit characterisation of these states. The explicit description of Gaussian states is pivotal to our methods for tackling all the simulation tasks. Central to our inquiry is the concept of Gaussian rank -- a pivotal metric defining the minimum terms required for decomposing a quantum state into Gaussian constituents. This metric holds paramount significance in determining the runtime of rank-based simulations for MGCs featuring magic state inputs. The absence of low-rank decompositions presents a computational hurdle, thereby prompting a deeper examination of fermionic magic states. We find that the Gaussian rank of 2 instances of our canonical magic state is 4 under symmetry-restricted decompositions. Additionally, our numerical analysis suggests the absence of low-rank decompositions for 2 or 3 copies of this magic state. Further, we explore the Gaussian extent, a convex metric offering an upper bound on the rank. We prove the Gaussian extent's multiplicative behaviour on 4-qubit systems, along with initial strides towards proving its sub-multiplicative nature in general settings. One important result in that direction we present is an upper bound on the Gaussian fidelity of generic states.</p>

            <h2>One Gate Scheme to Rule Them All: Introducing a Complex Yet Reduced Instruction Set for Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianxin Chen, Dawei Ding, Weiyuan Gong, Cupjin Huang, Qi Ye</p>
            <p>The design and architecture of a quantum instruction set are paramount to the performance of a quantum computer. This work introduces a gate scheme for qubits with $XX+YY$ coupling that directly and efficiently realizes any two-qubit gate up to single-qubit gates. First, this scheme enables high-fidelity execution of quantum operations and achieves minimum possible gate times. Second, since the scheme spans the entire $\textbf{SU}(4)$ group of two-qubit gates, we can use it to attain the optimal two-qubit gate count for algorithm implementation. These two advantages in synergy give rise to a quantum Complex yet Reduced Instruction Set Computer (CRISC). Though the gate scheme is compact, it supports a comprehensive array of quantum operations. This may seem paradoxical but is realizable due to the fundamental differences between quantum and classical computer architectures. Using our gate scheme, we observe marked improvements across various applications, including generic $n$-qubit gate synthesis, quantum volume, and qubit routing. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also realizes a gate locally equivalent to the commonly used CNOT gate with a gate time of $\frac{\pi}{2g}$, where $g$ is the two-qubit coupling. The AshN scheme is also completely impervious to $ZZ$ error, the main coherent error in transversely coupled systems, as the control parameters implementing the gates can be easily adjusted to take the $ZZ$ term into account.</p>

            <h2>Efficient entanglement-assisted discrimination of a class of many-copy indistinguishable sets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Srivastav, Saronath Halder</p>
            <p>We explore entanglement as a resource to distinguish locally indistinguishable orthogonal quantum states. Specifically, we consider sets which contain states from an unextendible product basis along with a pure entangled state. We establish a connection between the aforesaid problem and the entanglement-assisted discrimination of a certain class of many-copy indistinguishable sets. The entanglement-assisted protocols that we construct here are quite efficient, as they render the teleportation-based protocols sub-optimal. In fact, a central aspect of our study is to explore the role of Schmidt rank as a resource to distinguish the states of locally indistinguishable sets. Interestingly, we identify an instance where a set of locally indistinguishable orthogonal states remains locally indistinguishable even with access to any finite number of copies, yet becomes perfectly distinguishable using entangled resources of relatively low cost. This fact makes it possible to compare the degrees of local indistinguishability associated with several locally indistinguishable sets within the same Hilbert space. Consequently, we report a hierarchy of local indistinguishability among the many-copy indistinguishable sets. Thereafter, based on our analysis, we present a theoretical proposal for an information processing protocol exhibiting secure locking of information and its resource-efficient extraction. Furthermore, we also find that the hierarchical difference in local indistinguishability can increase with increasing dimension of the Hilbert space.</p>

            <h2>Covering a Graph with Minimal Local Sets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Claudet, Simon Perdrix</p>
            <p>Local sets, a graph structure invariant under local complementation, have been originally introduced in the context of quantum computing for the study of quantum entanglement within the so-called graph state formalism. A local set in a graph is made of a non-empty set of vertices together with its odd neighborhood. We show that any graph can be covered by minimal local sets, i.e. that every vertex is contained in at least one local set that is minimal by inclusion. More precisely, we introduce an algorithm for finding a minimal local set cover in polynomial time. This result is proved by exploring the link between local sets and cut-rank. We prove some additional results on minimal local sets: we give tight bounds on their size, and we show that there can be exponentially many of them in a graph. Finally, we provide an extension of our definitions and our main result to $q$-multigraphs, the graphical counterpart of quantum qudit graph states.</p>

Using the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond as an example, we employ a combined group theory and density functional theory study to demonstrate that spin-lattice relaxation of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin is significantly enhanced due to strong entanglement with orbital degrees of freedom in the $|^3E\rangle$ optical excited state of the defect. This mechanism is common to other solid-state defect nuclear spins with similar optical excited states. Additionally, we propose a straightforward and versatile \textit{ab initio} scheme for predicting orbital-dependent spin Hamiltonians for trigonal defects exhibiting orbital degeneracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongrui Chen, Bowen Li, Jianfeng Lu, Lexing Ying</p>
            <p>We study a qDRIFT-type randomized method to simulate Lindblad dynamics by decomposing its generator into an ensemble of Lindbladians, $L = \sum_{a \in A} L_a$, where each $L_a$ comprises a simple Hamiltonian and a single jump operator. Assuming an efficient quantum simulation is available for the Lindblad evolution $e^{t L_a}$, we implement $e^{t L_a}$ for a randomly sampled $L_a$ at each time step according to a probability distribution $\mu$ over the ensemble $\{L_a\}_{a \in A}$. This randomized strategy reduces the quantum cost of simulating Lindblad dynamics, particularly in quantum many-body systems with a large or even infinite number of jump operators. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed randomized method, covering both average and typical algorithmic realizations. This analysis extends the known results for the random product formula from closed systems to open systems, ensuring rigorous performance guarantees. Second, based on the random product approximation, we derive a new quantum Gibbs sampler algorithm that utilizes jump operators sampled from a Clifford-random circuit. This generator (i) can be efficiently implemented using our randomized algorithm, and (ii) exhibits a spectral gap lower bound that depends on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Our results present a new instance of a class of Hamiltonians for which the thermal states can be efficiently prepared using a quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm.</p>

            <p>Recently, interest in quantum computing has significantly increased, driven by its potential advantages over classical techniques. Quantum machine learning (QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are expected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances. This paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy physics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall short in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper, we use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare its performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare various setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of encoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a similar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our results indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their CNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of parameters. For the higher parameter regime, the QCNN circuit was adjusted according to the dimensional expressivity analysis (DEA) to lower the parameter count while preserving its optimal structure. The DEA circuit demonstrated improved results over the comparable classical CNN model.</p>

We provide a pedagogical outline for how two coupled harmonic oscillators, under a beam-splitter interaction, can exhibit hallmark signatures analogous to the photo-electric effect, including resonance conditions and quantised energy absorption. We discuss the implications of this model for recently proposed graviton detection protocols. This further clarifies that a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect, modelled as discrete energy transfer between harmonic oscillators can provide the first evidence of the graviton.</p>

In a fault tolerant scenario, BAE is capable of saturating the Heisenberg limit; if device noise is present, BAE can dynamically characterize it and self-adapt. We further propose aBAE, an annealed variant of BAE drawing on methods from statistical inference, to enhance robustness. Our proposals are parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offer tools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexisting information. Additionally, they accommodate experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We propose a robust benchmark for amplitude estimation algorithms and use it to test BAE against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios. In both cases, it achieves lower error than any other algorithm as a function of the cost. In the presence of decoherence, it is capable of learning when other algorithms fail.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</p>

            <p>Characterizing quantum processes is crucial for the execution of quantum algorithms on available quantum devices. A powerful framework for this purpose is the Quantum Model Learning Agent (QMLA) which characterizes a given system by learning its Hamiltonian via adaptive generations of informative experiments and their validation against simulated models. Identifying the incoherent noise of a quantum device in addition to its coherent interactions is, however, as essential. Precise knowledge of such imperfections of a quantum device allows to devise strategies to mitigate detrimental effects, for example via quantum error correction. We introduce the open Quantum Model Learning Agent (oQMLA) framework to account for Markovian noise through the Liouvillian formalism. By simultaneously learning the Hamiltonian and jump operators, oQMLA independently captures both the coherent and incoherent dynamics of a system. The added complexity of open systems necessitates advanced algorithmic strategies. Among these, we implement regularization to steer the algorithm towards plausible models and an unbiased metric to evaluate the quality of the results. We validate our implementation in simulated scenarios of increasing complexity, demonstrating its robustness to hardware-induced measurement errors and its ability to characterize systems using only local operations. Additionally, we develop a scheme to interface oQMLA with a publicly available superconducting quantum computer, showcasing its practical utility. These advancements represent a significant step toward improving the performance of quantum hardware and contribute to the broader goal of advancing quantum technologies and their applications.</p>

            <p>Photon distinguishability is a key factor limiting quantum interference in photonic devices, directly impacting the performance of protocols such as Boson Sampling and photonic quantum computing. We present a basis-independent framework for analyzing multi-photon interference, identifying a necessary and sufficient condition under which distinguishability behaves as a stochastic error process. This condition enables any multi-photon state to be uniquely expressed as a classical mixture of partition states -- discrete configurations representing different patterns of photon distinguishability. We introduce an experimentally implementable operation, analogous to Pauli twirling, that enforces this condition without compromising computational hardness. The resulting probability distribution over partition states defines the system's incoherent distinguishability spectrum, which we show can be fully characterized through a specific set of experiments. Building on this structure, we also demonstrate the existence of an error mitigation strategy. This framework clarifies key challenges in defining genuine multi-photon indistinguishability, links previous perspectives on partial distinguishability, and provides a rigorous foundation for robust photonic protocols.</p>

Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states.

However, noise from classical channels limits QKD distance. We demonstrate the longest-distance continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) over 120 km (20 dB loss) in the asymptotic regime, and over 100 km (17 dB loss) in the finite-size regime, both coexisting with a fully populated coarse wavelength division multiplexing system. Natural mode filtering of the local oscillator and phase noise mitigation enabled this without additional filtering or wavelength reallocation. Benchmarking against a commercial discrete-variable QKD system and considering finite-size effects confirms the feasibility of CV-QKD as a plug-and-play solution for typical 80-100 km long-haul optical networks. Our results set a record fiber distance for CV-QKD, showing its potential for cost-effective, large-scale deployment in existing network infrastructure.</p>

By virtue of the qutrit dissipation, the battery avoids the spontaneous discharging induced by the time-reversal symmetry of any unitary-charging scheme. Irrespective of the initial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the maximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present. We use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective master equation for the battery, which is found to be equivalent to the high-order Fermi's golden rule adapted to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and spontaneous decay. We extract the optimization condition for charging efficiency and justify it in the finite-size battery with uniform energy splitting, the large spin battery, and the truncated harmonic-oscillator battery.</p>

            <p>Quantum tomography is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states and devices and estimating nonlinear properties of the systems. Performing full quantum state tomography on an $N_\mathrm{q}$ qubit system requires an exponentially increasing overhead with $O(3^{N_\mathrm{q}})$ distinct Pauli measurement settings to resolve all complex phases and reconstruct the density matrix. However, many potential quantum computing applications, such as linear system solves, require only real-valued amplitudes. We introduce a readout method for real-valued quantum states that reduces measurement settings required for state vector reconstruction to $O(N_\mathrm{q})$; the post-processing cost remains exponential $\Omega(2^{N_\mathrm{q}})$. This approach offers a substantial speedup over conventional tomography. We experimentally validate our method up to 10 qubits on the latest available IBM quantum processor and demonstrate that it accurately extracts key properties such as entanglement and magic. Our method also outperforms the standard SWAP test for state overlap estimation. This calculation resembles a numerical integration in certain cases and can be applied to extract nonlinear properties, which are important in application fields. We further implement the method to readout the solution from a quantum linear solver.</p>

            <h2>Waveguides in a quantum perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eddy Collin, Alexandre Delattre</p>
            <p>Solid state quantum devices, operated at dilution cryostat temperatures, are relying on microwave signals to both drive and read-out their quantum states. These signals are transmitted into the cryogenic environment, out of it towards detection devices, or even between quantum systems by well-designed waveguides, almost lossless when made of superconducting materials. Here we report on the quantum theory that describes the simplest Cartesian-type geometries: parallel plates, and rectangular tubes. The aim of the article is twofold: first on a technical and pragmatic level, we provide a full and compact quantum description of the different traveling wave families supported by these guides. Second, on an ontological level, we interpret the results and discuss the nature of the light fields corresponding to each mode family. The concept of potential difference is extended from transverse electric-magnetic (TEM) waves to all configurations, by means of a specific gauge fixing. The generalized flux $\phi$ introduced in the context of quantum electronics becomes here essential: it is the scalar field, conjugate of a charge $Q$, that confines light within the electrodes, let them be real or virtual. The gap in the dispersion relations of non-TEM waves turns out to be linked either to a potential energy necessary for the photon confinement, or to a kinetic energy arising from a photon mass. We finally compute the field zero-point fluctuations in every configuration. The theory is predictive: the lowest transverse magnetic (TM) modes should have smaller quantum noise than the higher ones, which at large wavevectors recover a conventional value similar to TEM and transverse electric (TE) ones. Such low-noise modes might be particularly useful for the routing of quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Guo, Jaime Park, Frank X. Lee</p>
            <p>We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide secure key material between two parties without relying on assumptions about the computational power of an eavesdropper. QKD is performed over quantum links and quantum networks, systems which are resource-intensive to deploy and maintain. To evaluate and optimize performance prior to, during, and after deployment, realistic simulations with attention to physical realism are necessary. Quantum network simulators can simulate a variety of quantum and classical protocols and can assist in quantum network design and optimization by offering realism and flexibility beyond mathematical models which rely on simplifying assumptions and can be intractable to solve as network complexity increases. We use a versatile discrete event quantum network simulator to simulate the entanglement-based QKD protocol BBM92 and compare it to our experimental implementation and to existing theory. Furthermore, we simulate secure key rates in a repeater key distribution scenario for which no experimental implementations exist.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Lake</p>
            <p>We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</p>

            <p>Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound, and hence that stability always holds at high temperature. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.</p>

            <p>We address the longstanding challenge of consistently updating quantum states after selective measurements in a relativistic spacetime. Standard updates along the future lightcones preserve causality but break correlations between causally disconnected parties, whereas updates along the past lightcone either imply retrocausality or do not respect the causal propagation of information. We introduce a minimal extension of multipartite states to encode subsystem-specific contextual information. This "polyperspective" formalism ensures causally consistent covariant state updates, preserves multipartite correlations, and respects conservation laws.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling dynamics such as in random unitary circuits. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</p>

            <p>Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Annarita Scocco, Wai-Keong Mok, Leandro Aolita, Mario Collura, Tobias Haug</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer RÃ©nyi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources.</p>

            <h2>On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian De Vuyst, Philipp A. Hoehn, Artur Tsobanjan</p>
            <p>The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.</p>

            <p>Reliable verification of entanglement is a central requirement for quantum networks. This paper presents a practical verification approach based on violations of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. We derive tight mathematical bounds that relate the CHSH value to entanglement fidelity and introduce a statistical framework that optimizes resource usage while ensuring reliable certification. Our main contributions are: (i) fidelity bounds derived directly from the CHSH measure, which also enable nonlocality certification at sufficiently high fidelities; (ii) a sample-complexity analysis that quantifies the number of measurements required to achieve desired confidence levels for the CHSH measure and the entanglement fidelity; and (iii) verification protocols, some with rigorous mathematical guarantees and others with numerical evaluation. Using NetSquid, we develop a simulation framework that models diverse network conditions and enables systematic exploration of trade-offs in CHSH-based verification. This framework highlights the interplay between accuracy, efficiency, and operational parameters, providing concrete guidelines for deploying entanglement verification in resource-constrained quantum networks.</p>

            <p>We introduce graded quantum codes, unifying two classes of quantum error-correcting codes. The first, quantum weighted algebraic geometry (AG) codes, derives from rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces over finite fields. This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted this http URL second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces, generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors. A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k + 2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ reflects entropy adjustments from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields. Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.</p>

            <p>The idea of average of maximum teleportation fidelities was introduced in [1] to measure the capability of the network to act as a resource for distributed teleportation between any pair of nodes. Binary tree network, being a subclass of Cayley tree network, is a significant topological structure used for information transfer in a hierarchical sense. In this article, we consider four types of binary tree repeater networks (directed and undirected, asymmetric and symmetric) and obtain the analytical expressions of the average of the maximum teleportation fidelities for each of these binary tree networks. Our work investigates the role of directionality and symmetry in this measure. Like [1], here also we have used simple Werner state-based models and are able to identify the parameter ranges for which these networks can show quantum advantage. We explore the role of maximally entangled states in the network to enhance the quantum advantage. We explore the large $N$ (nodes) scenario for each of these networks and find out the limiting value of the average of the maximum teleportation fidelity for each of these networks. We also include the scenarios when the Werner state parameters for each link are different and chosen from a uniform distribution. According to our analysis, the directed symmetric binary tree is the most beneficial topology in this context.

            <p>Quantum turbulence spans length scales from the system size $L$ to the healing length $\xi$, making direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation computationally expensive when $L \gg \xi$. We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory usage by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics such as Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover novel physics.</p>

            <p>In quantum causality, local laboratories are typically assumed to be operationally independent, each free to choose its own reference frames. We ask whether such independence is compatible with nonclassical correlations, and address this question using the resource-theoretic framework. We formalize local gauge freedom on laboratory connections as a symmetry, and prove that any bipartite process covariant under this symmetry is causally separable. This result holds in arbitrary dimensions and applies both to marginals of multipartite quantum circuits and to general reductions across cuts. Because such covariance enforces a strict superselection rule, it explains why circuit-embeddable dynamics, such as the quantum switch, cannot violate bipartite causal inequalities, even asymptotically. Our analysis thus establishes that generating nonclassical causal correlations requires physical resources that break operational independence.</p>

            <p>Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.</p>

Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting.

            <p>We study the Connes spectral distance of quantum states and analyse the nonlocality of a 4D generalized noncommutative phase space. By virtue of the Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation, we obtain the Dirac operator and construct a spectral triple corresponding to the noncommutative phase space. Based on the ball condition, we obtain some constraint relations about the optimal elements, and then calculate the Connes spectral distance between two Fock states. Due to the noncommutativity, the spectral distances between Fock states in generalized noncommutative phase spaces are shorter than those in normal phase spaces. This shortening of distances implies some type of nonlocality caused by the noncommutativity. These spectral distances in the 4D generalized noncommutative phase space are additive and satisfy the normal Pythagoras theorem. When the noncommutative parameters go to zero, the results return to those in normal quantum phase spaces.</p>

            <p>We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability for Canonical and non-Canonical Statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruo-Xun Zhai, C.P. Sun</p>
            <p>We extend the CarathÃ©odory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</p>

            <p>We compare methods for signal classification applied to voltage traces from transition-edge sensors (TES) which are photon-number resolving detectors fundamental for accessing quantum advantages in information processing, communication and metrology. We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon-number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon-number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.</p>

            <h2>Observation of quantized vortex in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at Dirac point with emergent spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunda Li, Wei Han, Zengming Meng, Wenxin Yang, Cheng Chin, Jing Zhang</p>
            <p>When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanning Yin, Stefan Willitsch</p>
            <p>Coulomb crystals -- ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps -- find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach to determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pretrained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100--299 and secular temperatures of 5--15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Morgan Del Gratta, Federica Fabbri, Priyanka Lamba, Fabio Maltoni, Davide Pagani</p>
            <p>We study the quantum properties of the Higgs-boson decays into four fermions via two vector bosons $(H\to VV^*\to 4f)$. In particular, we focus on the case of two different-flavour lepton pairs $(H\to ZZ^*\to \mu^+\mu^- e^+ e^-)$. We compute the quantum-information observables for the corresponding two-qutrit system $(ZZ)$ at next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) accuracy in the SM. We find that NLO EW corrections lead to giant (order 1) effects in some specific cases, significantly altering the extraction of observables quantifying the quantum correlations. We identify observables that are robust and can be used to extract reliable information. Finally, we discuss possible new physics (NP) effects, parametrised via an effective-field-theory approach. We show how quantum observables can increase the sensitivity to NP also for the process considered in this study.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic-field-dependent contrast and coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at \SI{750}{nm} while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 49.07(33) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized NV-diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 ft/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</p>

            <p>Fibre Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) are used in various studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and quantum technologies due to the cavity's small mode volume and compact integration with optical fibres. We develop a novel $\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by $\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 $\mu$m to 700 $\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\mu$m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser machined fibre end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to demonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.</p>

            <h2>More on genuine multi-entropy and holography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin, Mitsuhiro Nishida</p>
            <p>By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.</p>

            <p>An interesting question in physics is how the correlation energy of atoms evolves upon forming a solid. Here, we address this problem for a specific case of double-layer FeSe. We used many-body wavefunction-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to compute the correlation energies of double-layer FeSe with different geometrical configurations and compared them with those of isolated Fe and Se atoms. Variational and diffusion QMC calculations were carried out with Slater Jastrow trial wavefunctions employing two alternative forms for the homogeneous two-body pair correlation term. The ground-state energy was obtained in the thermodynamic limit using two types of trial wave functions of JDFT, in which only the Jastrow factor is optimized while the Slater determinant is derived from the local density approximation, and JSD, where both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized simultaneously. Our results indicate that the correlation energy of double layer FeSe at the thermodynamic limit is mainly determined by the atomic contributions, with the bonding between atoms playing a comparatively minor role in it. After optimizing the interlayer separation of double-layer FeSe under tensile strain, we analyze the correlation energy as a function of strain and separation. We found that with increasing tensile stretch and interlayer spacing, the correlation energy of double-layer FeSe stochastically approaches that of its constituent atomic fragments.</p>

We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-inspired probability metrics define a complete, universal space for statistical learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Logan S. McCarty</p>
            <p>Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural, social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes ($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.</p>

            <p>We describe relativistic particles with spin as points moving in phase space $X=T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$, where $T^* R^{1,3}=R^{1,3}\times R^{1,3}$ is the space of coordinates and momenta, and $C^2_L$ and $C^2_R$ are the spaces of representation of the Lorentz group of type $(\frac12 , 0)$ and $(0, \frac12)$. Passing from relativistic mechanics with a Lorentz-invariant Hamiltonian function $H$ on the phase space $X$ to quantum mechanics with a Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$, we introduce two complex conjugate line bundles $L_C^+$ and $L_C^-$ over $X$. Quantum particles are introduced as sections $\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$, and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$ antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$. Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin $s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$ in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the SchrÃ¶dinger equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$. Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents, which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>The interplay of interaction and dissipation in open quantum systems can forge phase transitions beyond conventional paradigms. In the canonical quantum Rabi model, we demonstrate that a photon-photon (Kerr) interaction transforms the celebrated superradiant phase transition, inducing a line that separates continuous, second-order behavior from discontinuous, first-order regimes. Strikingly, this is not a line of tricritical points. Instead, we prove that genuine tricriticality is an isolated phenomenon, emerging only at a single, mathematically exact dissipation rate: the ``sweet spot'' of $\kappa_t^2 = (\sqrt{13}-2)/3$. Our discovery pinpoints the precise and restrictive conditions for realizing a rare multicritical point in a foundational quantum optical system, identifying this critical dissipation as a unique gateway to a higher order of criticality.</p>

We demonstrate the performance of QSS-VQE through simulations of molecular excited states, including dihydrogen and a conical intersection in cytosine. Additionally, we explore a bosonic model Hamiltonian to assess the expressivity of qumode gates, identifying regimes where qumode-based implementations outperform purely qubit-based approaches.

            <p>Large single-atom cooperativity in quantum systems is important for quantum information processing. Here, we propose to exponentially enhance the single-atom cooperativity parameter by exploiting the strongly localized effect of modes in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems. By increasing the wing width of a cavity with special geometry symmetry, the interference property allows us to exponentially improves the quality factor Q without altering the mode volume V for cavities supporting subwavelength light modes. This effectively overcomes the trade-off between Q and V in conventional subwavelength Fabry-Perot cavities. Consequently, we demonstrate the occurrence of ultra-long vacuum Rabi oscillations and the generation of strong photon blockade by enhancing the single-atom cooperativity parameter. This work offers a promising approach for advancing coherent manipulation and holds significant potential for applications in establishing longer-distance quantum communication networks, enhancing the precision and stability of quantum sensors, and improving the efficiency of quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>Tracking the dynamics of a quantum system is conventionally achieved by monitoring the system continuously in time and filtering the information contained in measurement records via the causal quantum trajectory approach. However, in practical scenarios there is often loss of information to the environment, leading to filtered states that are impure because of decoherence. If real-time tracking is not required, the lost information can be maximally extracted via acausal quantum state smoothing, which has been theoretically proven to better restore the system's coherence (purity) than causal filtering. Interestingly, quantum state smoothing requires assumptions of how any lost quantum information (unobserved by the experimenter) was turned into classical information by the environment. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate smoothing scenarios, using an optical parametric oscillator and introducing `observed' and `unobserved' channels by splitting the output beam into two independent homodyne detectors. We achieve improvement in state purification of 10.3% +/- 1.6%, squeezing restoration of 7.6% +/- 2.6%, and show that smoothed states are better estimates of hidden true states than those from conventional filtering. The estimation techniques used in this paper are promising for many applications in quantum information that incorporate post-processing.</p>

            <p>The generation of high Fock states of light pulses and their superpositions with provable quantum non-Gaussian features is still very challenging, although the power of conditional methods to herald the approximate state from the available Gaussian states is growing. The atom-light interaction in the high-Q cavity has been considered a viable alternative to the heralded Fock states of the light pulses from nonlinear optics limited to three-photon Fock states for the last decade. Here, by optimizing the realistic protocol combining it with available optical delay elements we conclusively predict filtering of Fock states up to ten photons with a high success rate of $20\%$ using a hierarchy of quantum non-Gaussian criteria. Moreover, the filtering protocol enables the preparation of superposition of Fock states and we analyse this emerging case up to two photons with with provable quantum non-Gaussian coherence and high success rate $50\%$. To demonstrate their quality for applications, we evaluate the robustness of such features, the bunching capability in a linear network, and the sensing capability to estimate the magnitude of unknown force, noise and phase, These assessments outline the essential conditions and application criteria for realistic optical cavity QED interaction on light pulses to outperform photon detection methods.</p>

            <p>A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a non-perturbative macroscopic QED model was built that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The non-resonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</p>

            <p>Magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as the most important solid-state quantum sensors. However, ensembles are limited in optical contrast to typically a few percent and high-sensitivity variants usually possess only a few $\mathrm{\mu}$T dynamic range. Here, we demonstrate a laser threshold magnetometry-based NV system that avoids these limitations. By integrating the NV centers into a laser cavity and showing magnetic-field-dependent shifts of the laser threshold, we observe 100\,\% contrast with strong output signals up to 50\,mW. The resulting system exhibits a dynamic range of $\pm$280\,$\mathrm{\mu}$T with a photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 670\,fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which we demonstrate to improve super-linearly with contrast. The ratio of these sensing-relevant parameters, that can be traded at the cost of each other, marks an improvement factor of 780 over typical fluorescence-based readout and vapor cell sensors. Such performance improvements open the door to new generations of sensors for applications including magnetoencephalography, magnetic navigation, and magnetic anomaly detection.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body systems present substantial technical challenges from both analytical and numerical perspectives. Despite these difficulties, some progress has been made, including studies of interacting atomic gases and interacting quantum spins. Furthermore, the potential for criticality to enhance engine performance has been demonstrated, suggesting a promising direction for future investigation. Here, we explore the performance of a quantum Otto cycle using a long-range Ising chain as the working substance. We consider an idealized cycle consisting of two adiabatic transformations and two perfect thermalizations, eliminating dissipation. Analyzing both engine and refrigerator modes, we investigate the influence of particle number, varied from 10 to 100, on efficiencies and behavior near the critical point of the phase transition, which we characterize using a scaling factor. We also examine how internal factors; specifically, the power-law exponent, the number of particles, and the hot and cold reservoir temperatures, affect the system's operation in different modes. Our results reveal that these factors have a different impact compared to their classical counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Magic State Cultivation on the Surface Code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yotam Vaknin, Shoham Jacoby, Arne Grimsmo, Alex Retzker</p>
            <p>Magic state cultivation is a newly proposed protocol that represents the state of the art in magic state generation. It uses the transversality of the $H_{XY}$ gate on the 2D triangular color-code, together with a novel grafting mechanism to transform the color-code into a matchable code with minimal overhead. Still, the resulting code has a longer cycle time and some high weight stabilizers. Here, we introduce three new cultivation protocols, each yielding a different magic state. These protocols avoid grafting by exploiting transversal operations on the surface code using non-local connectivity, allowing for a much lower post-selection rates in the expansion process. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our protocol achieves state-of-the-art infidelities and acceptance rates for magic state generation, on par with another recent proposal on the $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code, while still preserving the local geometry of the surface code. Moreover, in platforms such as cold atoms and trapped ions, where idle error rates are lower than two-qubit gate errors, we demonstrate that cultivation exhibits an even greater advantage, yielding an additional order-of-magnitude reduction in resource requirements. Lastly, we analyze the effect of erasure qubits on cultivation and show that \emph{algorithmically-relevant} infidelities can be achieved using only 9 erasure qubits on a distance-2 surface code with a single cultivation round.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germain Tobar, Joshua Foo, Sofia Qvarfort, Fabio Costa, Rivka Bekenstein, Magdalena Zych</p>
            <p>The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions, resulting in non-trivial particle content across these sub-regions. However, accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The arrays response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that photon content from entangled sub-regions of the vacuum causes subtle frequency shifts that are accessible to sub-wavelength atom array platforms. This novel approach for probing vacuum particle content stems from the systems unique ability to create coherent dynamics of superpositions of transmissive and reflective states, providing a quantum-enhanced platform for observing particle content from entangled spatial sub-regions of the electromagnetic field vacuum.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kousuke Kumasaki, Toshihiro Yada, Ken Funo, Takahiro Sagawa</p>
            <p>Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rutvij Bhavsar, Lewis Wooltorton, Joonwoo Bae</p>
            <p>Certifying a quantum state in a device independent (DI) manner, in which no trust is placed on the internal workings of any physical components, is a fundamental task bearing various applications in quantum information theory. The composability of a state certification protocol is key to its integration as a subroutine within information theoretic protocols. In this work, we present a composable certification of quantum states in a DI manner under the assumption that a source prepares a finite sequence of independent quantum states that are not necessarily identical. We show that the security relies on the DI analog of the fidelity, called the extractability. We develop methods to compute this quantity under local operations and classical communication in certain Bell scenarios that self test the singlet state, which may also be of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by certifying the singlet state in a composable and DI manner using the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt inequality.</p>

            <h2>Explicit C*-algebraic Protocol for Exact Universal Embezzlement of Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Liu</p>
            <p>We present an explicit construction of a universal embezzlement protocol in the C*-algebraic model of quantum information, that is equivalent to the commuting operator model. Our protocol enables exact embezzlement of arbitrary bipartite pure states using a single, fixed catalyst state. Unlike prior constructions that achieve only approximate embezzlement or require state-dependent catalysts, our approach is both exact and state-independent. The construction is explicit, based on simple *-automorphisms acting locally on infinite tensor products of CAR algebras with the underlying idea of the Hilbert hotel. In the dense-state case, the protocol naturally recovers the Type III_1 factor via the GNS construction, consistent with recent classification results. We further extend the construction to allow exact embezzlement of all states, at the cost of working with a non-separable C*-algebra. Despite the increase in algebraic size, the operational structure remains simple and localized. This offers a conceptually intuitive model for universal entanglement embezzlement in infinite-dimensional settings.</p>

Based on the generalized Schur decomposition, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for solving the GEPs in non-Hermitian systems.

We develop a method for evaluating both the loss function and its gradients on near-term quantum devices. We validate numerically the algorithm's performance through simulations, and demonstrate its application to GEPs in ocean acoustics. The algorithm's robustness is further confirmed through noise simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Parlato, Grazia Di Bello, Fabrizio Pavan, Giulio De Filippis, Carmine Antonio Perroni</p>
            <p>The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</p>

This configuration enhances the efficiency of a simple optomechanical engine operating beyond standard thermal paradigms. We further address scalability by coupling a second cavity in cascade configuration, where the same phaseonium gas drives both cycles. Our results demonstrate the operational viability of coherence-driven quantum engines and their potential for future thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulations of quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb gauge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyin Li</p>
            <p>In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. This is because the redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated in CG. Therefore, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariance, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. We point out that discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving algebraic equations of polarization vectors. We also discuss the procedure for mapping gauge fields to qubits, and then demonstrate the polynomial scaling of qubits and the complexity of time evolution. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Nur Ãnal, A. Nardin, N. Goldman</p>
            <p>Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines their quantized Hall conductivity. This invariant also emerges in circular dichroic responses, namely, by applying a circular drive and comparing excitation rates for opposite orientations. This work explores the dichroic response of confined, isolated quantum Hall systems, where bulk and edge contributions cancel exactly: When the edge response is properly isolated, the circular dichroic signal becomes quantized, serving as a direct and elegant probe of the many-body Chern number encoded in the edge physics. We demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. The edge response is also shown to be a sensitive diagnostic of geometric features. This opens the possibility of characterizing the shape of quantum Hall droplets through edge spectroscopic measurements, without requiring knowledge of the system's boundary profile. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p>We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Through this procedure, we obtain the system's impulse up to the second order for two massive objects. Similarly, we apply the forward scattering of the QBE to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While the forward scattering term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</p>

            <p>Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces an quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a level-set method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the scalar field offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.</p>

            <p>This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of hydrides thermodynamically stable at 0K. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of ($T_{\rm c}$). Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic hydrides with ($T_{\rm c}$) above 4.2~K and reach a maximum ($T_{\rm c}$) of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions and Many-Body Backflow in Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Zhang, Chang Shu, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations.</p>

QuLTRA directly models coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines and multi-line couplers without discretization into lumped-element equivalents, and extracts the circuit Hamiltonian parameters using the energy participation ratio (EPR) method. This approach enables fast and accurate extraction of mode frequencies, anharmonicities, cross-Kerr interactions, and Purcell decay rates without relying on full electromagnetic simulations, while naturally accounting for higher-order modes of distributed components. The performance of QuLTRA is validated against Ansys HFSS, pyEPR, QuCAT, and results from the literature, showing excellent agreement with orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational time with respect to full electromagnetic simulations. Some application examples are discussed, including the design of Purcell filters, multi-mode ultra-strong coupling systems, and multiplexed qubit readout schemes, demonstrating that QuLTRA can efficiently simulate complex architectures relevant to circuit quantum electrodynamics applications.</p>

            <p>We report the first demonstration of multiphoton, dual state entanglement distribution over a metropolitan scale commercial fiber network, implemented on the EPB Bohr IV quantum network in Chattanooga, TN, using an all fiber optic experimental platform. Employing a spatially degenerate, continuous wave type II SPDC biphoton source and fully fiber coupled linear optics, we generated a 4 photon entangled state. Through polarization projective measurements on two locally retained photons, we then probabilistically heralded the remaining two photons into either a Bell state (particle particle entanglement) or a N00N state (mode-mode entanglement), which were then distributed to two spatially separated network nodes. Experimental verification confirmed successful entanglement distribution across the deployed network despite significant channel losses and limited source fidelity. These results highlight the versatility of our polarization controlled multi photon entanglement distribution over real world telecom infrastructure and lay the groundwork for future upgrades, including higher quality non degenerate photon sources, White Rabbit timing synchronization for true multi node entanglement, and active polarization control for enhanced fidelity and long term stability.</p>
