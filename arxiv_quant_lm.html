            <h2>Optimizing quantum violation for multipartite facet Bell inequalities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Fu Chen, Mengyao Hu, Jordi Tura</p>
            <p>Nonlocality shapes quantum correlations, revealed through the violation of Bell inequalities. The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope.</p>

            <h2>Measuring multipartite entanglement efficiently by testing symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Liu, Jordi Tura, Albert Rico</p>
            <p>Recently, a technique known as quantum symmetry test has gained increasing attention for detecting bipartite entanglement in pure quantum states. In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems. Using these results we identify tradeoffs between estimation complexity and sensitivity of the presented entanglement measures, oriented to practical implementations.</p>

            <h2>Nonclassical State Generation and Quantum Metrology in the Double-Morse Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Firoz Chogle, Berihu Teklu, Jorge Zubelli, Ernesto Damiani</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear properties of the double-Morse potential as a possible resource for single-mode quantum states because of its double-well structure and anharmonicity. We derive the ground state wave function and the associated energy spectrum analytically, using the asymmetry (width parameter) $\alpha$ as the primary control parameter. These results show a systematic and evident influence on $\alpha$. We assess the non-Gaussianity and non-classicality measures, quantifying their nonlinearity and quantum behavior. In particular, we discover that both metrics rise monotonically with $\alpha$. Furthermore, we examine the metrological performance for estimating $\alpha$. By calculating the pertinent Fisher information and building workable estimators, we show that optimal strategies can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound, with straightforward position measurements on shallow wells already producing high precision. These results collectively demonstrate that the double-Morse potential is a genuine, controllable source of non-Gaussianity, whose non-classicality and metrological applications increase with $\alpha$. We highlight the potential applications of this model in real-world quantum technologies and discuss the implications for continuous-variable quantum information processing and computation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Semantic Communication Beyond the Shannon-Wyner Channel Capacity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Wang, Gui-Fa Zhu, Guo-Fei Long, Jianxing Guo, Yu-Chen Liu, Dong Pan, Li-Ping Nong, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC), a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in quantum communication, exploits quantum states for unmediated information transmission. Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits. This breakthrough not only clears the path for large-scale QSDC deployment but also marks a pivotal milestone in quantum information science.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Remote Magnon-Magnon Entanglement with Quantum Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gong, Yan-Xue Cheng, Wei Xiong, Jiaojiao Chen</p>
            <p>Cavity magnonics, owing to its strong magnon-photon coupling and excellent tunability, has attracted significant interest in quantum information science. However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.</p>

            <h2>Collective Vibronic Cascade in Cavity-Coupled Jahn-Teller Active Molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suraj Kumar Pandit, Abhinay Pandey, Athreya Shankar, Krishna R. Nandipati</p>
            <p>We study the polaritonic states and dynamics of multiple Jahn-Teller (JT) active molecules coupled to the modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity. We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system. Our results uncover new pathways for vibronic angular momentum transfer unique to collective molecular polaritonics with potential implications for cavity-assisted photo-physics and photo-chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Repulsive Inverse-Distance Interatomic Interaction from Many-Body Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Loris Di Cairano, Matteo Gori, Reza Karimpour, Alexandre Tkatchenko</p>
            <p>Interactions between objects can be classified as fundamental or emergent. Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales.</p>

            <h2>Exact-factorization framework for electron-nuclear dynamics in electromagnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir U. Nazarov, E. K. U. Gross</p>
            <p>The Exact Factorization (EF) theory aims at the separation of the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in the many-body (MB) quantum mechanical problem. Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Quantum Optics with Scalable Quantum Dot Dimers</h2>

            <p>We present a scalable method for electrically tuning multiple spatially separated quantum dots embedded in photonic crystal waveguides. Ion implantation into the top p-doped layer of a p-i-n diode creates high-resistivity tracks, providing electrical isolation between adjacent regions. Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model. Our results mark an important step towards scalable, multi-emitter architectures for chiral quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Cloutman, Matthew Chilcott, Alexander Elliott, J. Susanne Otto, Amita B. Deb, Niels Kjærgaard</p>
            <p>Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.</p>

            <h2>Logical channel for heralded and pure loss with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom B. Harris, Takaya Matsuura, Ben Q. Baragiola, Nicolas C. Menicucci</p>
            <p>Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when the light scattered out of the signal mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.</p>

            <h2>Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Dey Chowdhury, J. P. Manley, C. A. Condos, A. R. Agrawal, D. J. Wilson</p>
            <p>Cavity optomechanical systems have recently been proposed as detectors for ultralight dark matter, leveraging their ability to cool and probe mechanical oscillators at the quantum limit. Here we present a resonant search for ultralight dark matter using a cavity optomechanical accelerometer. The detector consists of a cryogenic Si$_3$N$_4$-membrane cavity mounted to a 4 K copper plate, with photothermal tuning used to scan its 39 kHz mechanical resonance. Shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation-pressure feedback cooling yield an acceleration sensitivity of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over 30 Hz near resonance. The detector's material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter field. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched-filter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions.</p>

            <h2>From Quantum Relative Entropy to the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Dorau, Albert Much</p>
            <p>We provide arguments indicating that the semiclassical Einstein equations follow from quantum relative entropy and its proportionality to an area variation. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a central role in what is often seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>

            <h2>Controlled generation of 3D vortices in driven atomic Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico</p>
            <p>We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</p>

            <h2>Memory effects in repeated uses of quantum channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayden Zammit, Roberto Salazar, Gianluca Valentino, Johann A. Briffa, Tony J. G. Apollaro</p>
            <p>Quantum Information Processing (QIP) tasks can be efficiently formulated in terms of quantum dynamical maps, whose formalism is able to provide the appropriate mathematical representation of the evolution of open quantum systems. A key QIP task is quantum state transfer (QST) aimed at sharing quantum information between distant nodes of a quantum network, enabling, e.g. quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. QST has primarily been addressed insofar by resetting the quantum channel after each use, thus giving rise to memoryless channels. Here we consider the case where the quantum channel is continuously used, without implementing time- and resource- consuming resetting operations. We derive a general, analytical expression for the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$-use average QST fidelity for $U(1)$-symmetric channels and apply our formalism to a perfect QST channel in the presence of imperfect readout timing. We show that even relatively small readout timing errors give rise to memory effects which have a highly detrimental impact on subsequent QST tasks.</p>

            <p>Randomness is fundamental for secure communication and information processing. While continuous-variable optical systems offer an attractive platform for this task, certifying genuine quantum randomness in such setups remains challenging. We present a semi-device-independent scheme for randomness certification tailored to continuous-variable implementations, where the dimension assumption is operationally implemented by restricting state preparations to the two-level Fock subspace. Using standard homodyne and displacement-based measurements, we show that simple optical setups can achieve dimension-witness violations that certify positive min-entropy, even in the presence of realistic losses and misaligned reference frames. These results demonstrate that practical and scalable quantum randomness generation is achievable with minimal experimental complexity on continuous-variable platforms.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV-) is an excellent solid state qubit with optically-addressable transitions and a long electron spin coherence time at elevated temperatures. However, implementing scalable quantum nodes with high-fidelity optical readout of the electron spin state requires efficient photon emission and collection from the system. In this manuscript, we report a quantum photonic interface for SnV- centers based on one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities fabricated in diamond thin films. Furthermore, we develop a model describing the spontaneous emission dynamics of our system, allowing for rigorous determination of Purcell factors and the C/D branching ratio from cavity enhancement of the C and D transitions of the SnV- zero phonon line. We observe quality factors up to ~6000 across this sample, and measure up to a 12-fold lifetime reduction. By considering the lifetime reduction of both the C and D transitions independently, we determine the C/D branching ratio to be {\eta}BR=0.7815, in line with previous theoretical and experimental findings. Finally from our analysis, we extract a Purcell factor of up to Fc=26.21(0.01) for a single SnV- transition.</p>

            <p>The ability to preserve multipartite entanglement in noisy environments is central to advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we develop a semiclassical theoretical model of three entangled qubits exposed to local Markov noise environments with tunable statistical correlations between noise sources. We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.</p>

            <h2>Self-induced manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Wei Zhang, Chao Chen, Jizhou Wu</p>
            <p>Biphoton states have shown promising applications in quantum information processing, including quantum communications, quantum metrology, and quantum imaging. The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction. Here we present a comprehensive method for regulating the topological properties of the system by combining the nonlinearity in waveguides, i.e., nonlinearity in the waveguide coupling materials, and the waveguide lattice structure. Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous "active" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations. Our method enables the reusability and versatility of SSH lattice chips and their application for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, promoting the industrialization process of quantum technology.</p>

Our approach achieves reliable integrated quantum storage with record efficiencies of 80.3(7)% for weak coherent pulses and 69.8(1.6)% for telecom-heralded single photons, alongside the storage of 20 temporal modes with an average efficiency of 51.3(2)%. Moreover, the thin-membrane Eu3+:Y2SiO5 architecture enables spectrally tunable efficient quantum storage via variable strain, providing a flexible interface for quantum networks.

            <h2>Recovery of optical losses with the Petz recovery map</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinyan Chen, Minjeong Song, Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>Optical systems are a main platform for quantum information processing, while a hidden challenge in these systems is information loss due to scattering into unmonitored modes, typically modeled as state-independent beam-splitter interactions. While such losses simply erase information encoded across modes, they directly degrade information encoded in the quantum state of a mode. Perfect correction of these Gaussian lossy channels with Gaussian operations alone is known to be impossible. In this work, we investigate the Petz recovery map as an approximate recovery. We construct the Petz recovery of single mode losses and its implementations. In particular, we show that the recovery performance of Petz recovery map is better than the recovery protocol that replaces the noisy state with the belief state. Also, when the reference state is far from the true state, it is better not to use the Petz recovery map but to leave the noisy state instead. We discuss the physical intuition of Petz recovery map and finally shows that it is near-optimal among the considered recovery protocols.</p>

The robustness of these "squeezed-vacuum codes" arises from being arranged at evenly spaced angles in phase-space, and simultaneously in evenly spaced photon-number support $n \equiv {2k} \! \pmod {2m}$. We present simple preparation circuits: a two-legged code using a Hadamard-conditional-squeezing-Hadamard sequence on an ancilla qubit, and for general "$m$-legged" codewords using sequences of conditional rotations. The performance of these codes is evaluated against loss and dephasing noises using the Knill-Laflamme violation function and benchmarked against cat codes. As the number $m$ of squeezed-vacuum states in a code increases, the code exhibits improved loss tolerance at the cost of higher dephasing sensitivity. We outline implementations in circuit QED and trapped-ion platforms, where high-fidelity Gaussian operations and conditional controls are available or under active development. These results help establish squeezed-vacuum codes as practical, hardware-ready, members of the bosonic codes class.</p>

            <h2>Quantum optical neural networks using atom-cavity interactions to provide all-optical nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanzhou Zhu, Tianyu Wang, Peter L. McMahon, Daniel Soh</p>
            <p>Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been developed to enhance processing speed and energy efficiency in machine learning by leveraging optical devices for nonlinear activation and establishing connections among neurons. In this work, we propose a quantum optical neural network (QONN) that utilizes atom-cavity neurons with controllable photon absorption and emission. These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional QONN to facilitate a real-world satellite image classification (SAT-6) task. Due to its compact hardware and low power consumption, the QONN offers a promising solution for real-time satellite sensing, reducing communication bandwidth with ground stations and thereby enhancing data security.</p>

            <p>Single-photon emitters are fundamental building blocks for quantum information processing, communication and sensing. However, unwanted interactions with bulk phonons in their host environment strongly limit their coherence and controllability. We report single color centers in nanodiamonds that are strongly and comprehensively decoupled from the bulk phononic environment. The color centers feature record-narrow linewidths down to 0.3 nm at room temperature and stable, bright emission, exceeding 10 Mcps in saturation. Notably, the bulk phonon sideband is almost entirely suppressed, revealing the presence of a single localized vibrational mode outside the diamond phonon band. Our observations and simulations point towards a unique mechanism for phonon decoupling in common wide-gap materials, based on a strongly radiative orbital transition coupled to a localized vibrational mode. The new color center enables qualitatively higher performance for applications in quantum networks and nanoscale sensing, and the exploration of new physical resources associated with vibrational states.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum coherence in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system incorporating a squeezed-magnon drive. By analyzing the Gaussian quantum coherence of the cavity, magnonic, and mechanical subsystems, as well as the total system coherence, we identify the critical roles of phase control, coupling strength, drive power, and thermal noise. We show that the squeezing amplitude and phase precisely modulate the effective magnon frequency and damping, enabling phase-dependent enhancement and nonreciprocal transfer of coherence. Our systematic parameter analysis indicates that increasing driving power and photon-magnon coupling enhances quantum coherence, while thermal decoherence leads to its degradation. However, this effect is partially suppressed by the presence of magnon squeezing. The results show that squeezed magnons are a robust and tunable resource for controlling, stabilizing, and optimizing quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanical platforms, offering potential applications in hybrid magnonic systems and coherent quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>High-fidelity two-logical-qubit gates are essential for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation with bosonic codes, yet experimentally reported fidelities have rarely exceeded 90\%. Here, we propose a geometric phase engineering approach for implementing controlled-phase gates for binomially encoded logical qubits. This method leverages the structural simplicity of geometric drives to reduce the numerical optimization dimensionality while fully incorporating system nonlinearities, enabling fast and high-fidelity logical operations. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a process fidelity of 97.4$\pm$0.8\% for a controlled-Z gate between two binomial codes, surpassing all previously reported two-logical-qubit gates in bosonic codes. This work demonstrates that geometric phase engineering provides an effective and experimentally feasible route to fast, high-fidelity logical operations in bosonic quantum processors.</p>

            <p>The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.</p>

            <h2>Fault-Tolerant Encoding of Logical Qudits in Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumin Lim</p>
            <p>The universal quantum computer will enable the simulation of arbitrary quantum states governed by arbitrary Hamiltonians. In this context, it is essential to equip future quantum processors with fault-tolerant logical qudits, since qudits naturally align with the simulation of multi-level physical systems. In this study, we present a general framework and working examples of fault-tolerant logical qudit encoding using spin systems, which are among the most coherent and robust finite multi-level physical platforms. The d-dimensional logical qudit encoding with distance-3 (or 5) codewords can be designed within a 12d (or 40d)-dimensional Hilbert space, and the design can be further generalized to 2t+1-distance codes and to encodings exploiting multiple physical qudits. A quantitative comparison shows that the logical qudit encoding proposed here offers an exponential resource advantage over multi-level mappings from logical qubits, and therefore we believe this strategy can pave the way for realizing logical qudit encodings in finite multi-level physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithm for one quasi-particle excitations in the thermodynamic limit via cluster-additive block-diagonalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.</p>

            <p>Measurement incompatibility is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. In the context of estimating multiple parameters of a quantum system, this manifests as a fundamental trade-off between the precisions with which different parameters can be estimated. Often, a parameter can be optimally measured, but at the cost of gaining no information about incompatible parameters. Here, we report that there are systems where one parameter's information can be maximised while not completely losing information about the other parameters. In doing so, we find attainable trade-off relations for quantum parameter estimation with a structure that is different to typical Heisenberg-type trade-offs. We demonstrate our findings by implementing an optimal entangling measurement on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum computer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Fujiu, Shota Nagayama, Shin Nishio, Hideaki Kawaguchi, Takahiko Satoh</p>
            <p>The surface code is one of the leading quantum error correction codes for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu Yang, Yue Li, Mingtao Xu, Wei Yi, Jin-Shi Xu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>Open systems feature a variety of phenomena that arise from non-Hermitian physics. Recent theoretical studies have offered much insights into these phenomena through the non-Bloch band theory, though many of the theory's key features are experimentally elusive. For instance, the correspondence between complex momenta and non-Hermitian bands, while central to non-Bloch band theory, has so far defied direct experimental observation. Here we experimentally study the non-Hermitian spectral deformation in complex-momentum space, by implementing a non-Hermitian lattice with long-range couplings in the synthetic orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) dimension of photons inside a degenerate cavity. Encoding the complex momenta in the phase and amplitude modulations of the OAM modes, and devising a complex-momentum-resolved projective detection, we reconstruct the spectral deformation in momentum space, where the eigenspectrum on the complex plane morphs through distinct geometries. This enables us to experimentally extract key information of the system under the non-Bloch band theory, including exceptional points in the complex-momentum space, the open-boundary spectra, and the generalized Brillouin zone. Our work demonstrates a versatile platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics and non-Bloch band theory, and opens the avenue for direct experimental investigation of non-Bloch features in the complex-momentum space.</p>

            <p>Quantum algorithms have demonstrated provable speedups over classical counterparts, yet establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework to understand the quantum advantage remains a core challenge. In this work, we decode the quantum search advantage by investigating the critical role of quantum state properties in random-walk-based algorithms. We propose three distinct variants of quantum random-walk search algorithms and derive exact analytical expressions for their success probabilities. These probabilities are fundamentally determined by specific initial state properties: the coherence fraction governs the first algorithm's performance, while entanglement and coherence dominate the outcomes of the second and third algorithms, respectively. We show that increased coherence fraction enhances success probability, but greater entanglement and coherence reduce it in the latter two cases. These findings reveal fundamental insights into harnessing quantum properties for advantage and guide algorithm design. Our searches achieve Grover-like speedups and show significant potential for quantum-enhanced machine learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Heib, Andreea Silvia Goia, Sona Baghiyan, Robert Zeier, David Edward Bruschi</p>
            <p>We study, classify, and explore the mathematical properties of finite-dimensional Lie algebras occurring in the quantum dynamics of single-mode and self-interacting bosonic systems. These Lie algebras are contained in the real skew-hermitian Weyl algebra $\hat{A}_1$, defined as the real subalgebra of the Weyl algebra $A_1$ consisting of all skew-hermitian polynomials. A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone? (ii)~What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ that contain the free Hamiltonian? (iii) What are the non-abelian and finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras that can be faithfully realized in $\hat{A}_1$? We answer the first question by providing all possible realizations of all finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebras that are generated by monomials alone. We answer the second question by proving that any non-abelian and finite-dimensional subalgebra of $\hat{A}_1$ that contains a free Hamiltonian term must be a subalgebra of the Schrödinger algebra. We partially answer the third question by classifying all nilpotent and non-solvable Lie algebras that can be realized in $\hat{A}_1$, and comment on the remaining cases. Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results for quantum control theory. Our work constitutes an important stepping stone to understanding quantum dynamics of bosonic systems in full generality.</p>

Central to realizing the potential of quantum computing are perfect entangling (PE) two-qubit gates, which serve as a critical building block for universal quantum computation. In the context of quantum optimal control, shaping electromagnetic pulses to drive quantum gates is crucial for pushing gate performance toward theoretical limits. In this work, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover near-optimal pulse shapes that yield PE gates. A collection of RL agents is trained within robust simulation environments, enabling the identification of effective control strategies even under noisy conditions. Selected agents are then validated on higher-fidelity simulations, illustrating how RL-based methods can reduce calibration overhead when compared to quantum optimal control techniques. Furthermore, the RL approach is hardware agnostic with the potential for broad applicability across various quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>The pursuit of practical quantum utility on near-term quantum processors is critically challenged by their inherent noise. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation.</p>

We first review a unified theoretical framework that can encompass all existing nonadiabatic GQC approaches, then systematically examine the design principles of nonadiabatic geometric gates with a particular focus on how optimal control techniques can be leveraged to improve the accuracy and noise resistance. In addition, we conducted detailed numerical comparisons of various nonadiabatic GQC protocols, offering a quantitative assessment of their respective performance characteristics and practical limitations. Through this focused investigation, our aim is to provide researchers with both fundamental insights and practical guidance for advancing geometric approaches in quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs), acting as energy storage devices, have potential applications in future quantum science and technology. However, the QBs inevitably losses energy due to their interaction with environment. How to enhance the performance of the QBs in the open-system case remains an important challenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize the driven-dissipative QBs in atom-waveguide-QED systems and demonstrate significant improvements in both the stored energy and extractable work (ergotropy) of the QBs via feedback control. For a single-atom QB, we show that combining the measurement and coherent feedback controls enables nearly perfect stable charging under the weak coherent driving. For the QB array, the measurement-based feedback allows us to control different dynamical phases in the thermodynamic limit: (i) a continuous boundary time-crystal phase, where persistent periodic energy charge-discharge oscillations emerge despite the presence of the dissipation into the waveguide, and (ii) two stationary phases -- one reaches full charge while the other maintains only small energy storage. This work broadens the scope of driven-dissipative QBs and provides practical strategies for enhancing their performance.</p>

            <p>Relativistic time dilation implies that an accelerating excited atom would have its lifetime prolonged in the lab frame. In this paper, we demonstrate a complementary effect: Longer-lived excited atoms turn out to have been accelerated. We propose the following experiment. An excited atom is prepared in a superposition of momenta. Due to relativistic time dilation, in the lab frame, the decay rate of components with higher momentum is diminished. As time passes without the atom emitting a photon, higher-momentum components become more probable. This results in a time-dependent shift of the expectation value of momentum. Taking into account first-order relativistic corrections, we calculate the force and acceleration undergone by the atom due to the fact that it did not emit a photon.</p>

            <p>Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.</p>

            <p>Verification of quantum computations is crucial as experiments advance toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. Yet, no efficient protocol exists for certifying states generated in the Magic-State Injection model -- the foundation of several fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Here, we introduce an efficient protocol for certifying Clifford-enhanced Product States, a large class of quantum states obtained by applying an arbitrary Clifford circuit to a product of single-qubit, possibly magic, states. Our protocol only requires single-qubit Pauli measurements together with efficient classical post-processing, and has efficient sample complexity in both the independent (i.i.d.) and adversarial (non-i.i.d.) settings. This fills a key gap between Pauli-based certification schemes for stabilizer or (hyper)graph states and general protocols demanding non-Pauli measurements or classically intractable information about the target state. Our work provides the first efficient, Pauli-only certification protocol for the Magic-State Injection model, leading to practical verification of universal quantum computation under minimal experimental assumptions.</p>

            <p>In Nature, 646, 813 (2025), Aziz and Howl claim that classical (unquantised) gravity produces entanglement. We show that their model does not produce entanglement. Even if the model produced entanglement, it would be mediated by the quantised matter interaction, and not gravity. Hence entanglement mediated by gravity remains an unambiguous witness of gravity's quantum features.</p>

            <h2>Extending QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Quantum Optimization Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leanto Sunny, Abhinav Rijal, George Siopsis</p>
            <p>The recently proposed QAOA-GPT framework demonstrated that generative pre-trained transformers can learn mappings between problem graphs and optimized quantum circuits for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this work, we extend QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, focusing on spin-glass Hamiltonians that include cubic interaction terms. Using FEATHER graph embeddings to encode topological information, we train the model on graph-circuit pairs generated via ADAPT-QAOA and evaluate its performance on 8- and 16-qubit instances embedded on heavy-hex lattices. The generative model produces adaptive QAOA-like circuits and corresponding variational parameters in a single forward pass, bypassing the iterative classical optimization loop. The generated circuits achieve average approximation ratios exceeding 0.95, closely matching classically optimized ADAPT-QAOA results, while maintaining consistent parameter distributions across circuit depths. These results demonstrate that QAOA-GPT generalizes effectively to higher-order cost Hamiltonians and complex energy landscapes, establishing generative modeling as a scalable pathway toward autonomous variational circuit design and quantum algorithm discovery in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Perspectivism as a Framework of Scientific Inquiry in Quantum Mechanics and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vassilios Karakostas, Elias Zafiris</p>
            <p>Contemporary perspectivism is viewed as a framework of scientific inquiry concerning the origin, generation and systematization of scientific knowledge of nature by focusing on the conditions under which such knowledge may arise in perspectivist terms and investigating the essential ramifications of these conditions. To this end, we develop the conceptual, methodological and semantic framework of contemporary perspectivism according to the norms of the proposed endo-theoretic approach. Implementation of the preceding three-fold scheme in quantum mechanics implies that the global structure of a quantum algebra of events can be consistently comprehended through a multilevel structure of locally variable Boolean perspectives, interconnected in a category-theoretic environment, yielding jointly all the information encoded in the former. In this respect, the proposed approach validates the perspectivist/contextual nature of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level of discourse. Furthermore, due to its general character, it may acquire the form of a theoretical pattern of scientific inquiry in the natural sciences, especially when dealing with complex trans-perspectival phenomena, the analysis of which requires the use of information resulting from more than one perspective. Finally, in the appendix, we provide a concise comparative assessment between our perspectivist framework of quantum theory and Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Delay Time Characterization on FPGA: A Low Nonlinearity, Picosecond Resolution Time-to-Digital Converter on 16-nm FPGA using Bin Sequence Calibration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunwoo Park, Byungkwon Park, Eunsung Kim, Jiwon Yune, Seungho Han, Seunggo Nam</p>
            <p>We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico</p>
            <p>We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Tunable Spin Filtering and Valley Splitting Coexisting with Anomalous Hall Effect in 2D Half-Metallic VSe2/VN Heterostructure: Toward a Unified Spintronic-Valleytronic Platform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Chowdhury, Ahmed Zubair</p>
            <p>Rapid progress in valleytronics and spintronics is limited by the scarcity of two-dimensional materials that simultaneously provide robust valley splitting and strong spin selectivity. Here we showed that a van der Waals heterostructure (VSe2/VN) built from hexagonal VSe2 and hexagonal VN addressed this gap. Using first-principles density functional theory, phonon, ab initio molecular dynamics stability tests, Bader charge analysis, and Wannier-based Berry-curvature calculations, we demonstrated an energetically and dynamically stable heterostructure that exhibited interlayer charge transfer and a work function intermediate between the constituent monolayers. The electronic structure showed small indirect PBE gap (108.9 meV), with HSE06 indicating a half-metallic tendency; a sizable conduction-band valley splitting (\Delta CKK' = 22.9 meV for spin-up and \Delta CKK' = 61.3 meV for spin-down); and pronounced spin asymmetry, where the spin-down channel showed a wide semiconducting gap (0.64 eV) while the spin-up channel was nearly gapless. These features yielded a high zero-strain spin-filter efficiency P = 75.4%, tunable to 82.5% under +4% biaxial tensile strain. The heterostructure also supported non-zero, valley-contrasting Berry curvature, and a large anomalous Hall conductivity (peak sigmaxy = 568.33 S/cm). Importantly, mean-field estimation placed the ferromagnetic Curie temperature near room temperature at zero strain (Tc = 284.04 K), while Tc decreased to 183.9 K at +4% strain, the magnetic order remained robust to cryogenic temperatures, providing a beneficial tuning knob to balance spin-filter performance with thermal stability in device-relevant regimes. These results identified VSe2/VN as a practical, strain-tunable platform for integrated valleytronic, spintronic devices, and for exploring anomalous Hall and valley-dependent transport phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. A. Wadood, Shaurya Aarav, Kevin Liang, Jason W Fleischer</p>
            <p>Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2\pi/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.</p>

            <p>Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Er:YIG) holds the potential of combining the low magnetic damping of YIG with the telecom-band optical transitions of $\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions, making it a suitable material for hybrid optomagnonic devices and microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. We report the epitaxial growth of $\text{Er}_{x}\text{Y}_{3-x}\text{Fe}_{5}\text{O}_{12}$ films with $x=0.008-0.20$ on (111)-oriented gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction, reciprocal space mapping, and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm single-phase, fully coherent growth with atomically sharp interfaces across the entire substitution range. Magnetometry reveals a gradual decrease in saturation magnetization with increasing Er content, consistent with antiparallel coupling between Er$^{3+}$ spins and the net Fe$^{3+}$ moments, along with the emergence of an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The ferromagnetic resonance broadens with Er concentration due to increased Gilbert damping and inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. Films with low Er content ($x=0.008$), most relevant for optomagnonic applications, retain nearly isotropic magnetization and exhibit a damping parameter only slightly higher than that of undoped YIG. These results identify growth and substitution conditions that preserve YIG's low-loss magnetic properties while introducing optical functionality, establishing Er:YIG as a viable platform for hybrid quantum magnonics and microwave-to-optical transduction.</p>

            <h2>Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiguo Yin, A. M. Tsvelik</p>
            <p>The prohibition of finite-temperature phase transition in one-dimensional (1D) Ising models and 1D/2D quantum Heisenberg models with short-range interactions fundamentally constrains the application potentials of low-dimensional magnetic materials. Recently, ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), which can approach a transition at a desirable finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily closely, was discovered in 1D decorated Ising chains and ladders. Here we present a theoretical study of similarly decorated, yet much more challenging, quantum Heisenberg ferrimagnets in a magnetic field, which features ferromagnetic backbone exchange $J$, antiferromagnetic site-decoration coupling $J_{AF}$, and different magnetic moments for the backbone and decorating spins $\mu_aS_a<\mu_bS_b$. We exactly solved the model in the large $J$ limit -- as a central-macrospin model -- and found two finite-temperature second-order transitions; just above $T_{c2}$ a ``half-ice, half-fire'' regime appears. Finite-$J$ weak-field results follow from an effective-field mapping, suggesting the emergence of UNPC at finite $T_0$ in 2D square lattices thanks to its exponentially strong initial magnetic susceptibility $\chi_0\propto e^{4\pi S_a^2 J/T_0}$, though less likely in 1D chains where $\chi_0\propto J/T_0$. These results may shed light on new technological applications of low-dimensional quantum spin systems and attract experimental and computational tests.</p>

            <p>We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $\pi/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.</p>

            <p>One of the main residual limitations of inertial sensors based on atom interferometry stems from laser beam distortions, which cause parasitic phase shifts and non-homogeneous matter-light couplings. Here we present numerical simulations, accompanied by analytical calculations, which quantify the impact of these effects in a cold atom gradiometer. We demonstrate that the propagation of interferometric laser beam aberrations, combined with initial asymmetry and significant time-of-flight expansion of the the two atomic sources, limit the common-mode rejection of phase noise in a differential configuration. The resulting deviations in gravitational acceleration and its gradient are within reach of current experimental devices. Our study allows us to evaluate the surface quality requirements for retroreflective optics in cold-atom gradiometers of various baselines, and can be extended to other sensors based on different interferometer geometries.</p>

            <p>Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</p>

            <p>Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.</p>

            <h2>A Graphical Calculus for Quantum Computing with Multiple Qudits using Generalized Clifford Algebras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Lin</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a graphical calculus for multi-qudit computations with generalized Clifford algebras, building off the algebraic framework developed in our prior work. We build our graphical calculus out of a fixed set of graphical primitives defined by algebraic expressions constructed out of elements of a given generalized Clifford algebra, a graphical primitive corresponding to the ground state, and also graphical primitives corresponding to projections onto the ground state of each qudit. We establish many properties of the graphical calculus using purely algebraic methods, including a novel algebraic proof of a Yang-Baxter equation and a construction of a corresponding braid group representation. Our algebraic proof, which applies to arbitrary qudit dimension, also enables a resolution of an open problem of Cobanera and Ortiz on the construction of self-dual braid group representations for even qudit dimension. We also derive several new identities for the braid elements, which are key to our proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in many cases, the verification of involved vector identities can be reduced to the combinatorial application of two basic vector identities. Additionally, in terms of quantum computation, we demonstrate that it is feasible to envision implementing the braid operators for quantum computation, by showing that they are 2-local operators. In fact, these braid elements are almost Clifford gates, for they normalize the generalized Pauli group up to an extra factor $\zeta$, which is an appropriate square root of a primitive root of unity.</p>

Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that integrates these two methods, inheriting their distinct features in efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states and overcoming their limitations. We first introduce non-stoquasticity indicators (NSIs) and their upper bounds, which measure the sign problem, the most notable limitation of QMC. We show that our algorithm could greatly mitigate the sign problem, which decreases NSIs with the assistance of quantum computing. Meanwhile, the use of quantum Monte Carlo also increases the expressivity of shallow quantum circuits, allowing more accurate computation that is conventionally achievable only with much deeper circuits. We numerically test and verify the method for the N$_2$ molecule (12 qubits) and the Hubbard model (16 qubits). Our work paves the way to solving practical problems with intermediate-scale and early-fault tolerant quantum computers, with potential applications in chemistry, condensed matter physics, materials, high energy physics, etc.</p>

            <p>Random ensembles of pure states have proven to be extremely important in various aspects of quantum physics such as benchmarking the performance of quantum circuits, testing for quantum advantage, providing novel insights for many-body thermalization and studying the black hole information paradox. Although generating a fully random ensemble is experimentally challenging, approximations of it are just as useful and are known to emerge naturally in a variety of physical models, including Rydberg setups. These are referred to as approximate quantum state designs, and verifying their degree of randomness can be an expensive task, similar to performing full quantum state tomography on many-body systems. In this theoretical work, we efficiently validate the character of approximate quantum designs with respect to data size acquisition when compared to the conventional frequentist approach. This is achieved by translating the information residing in the complex many-body state into a succinct representation of classical data using a random projective measurement basis, which is then processed using methods of statistical inference such as maximum likelihood estimation and neural networks and benchmarked against the predictions of shadow tomography. Our scheme of combining machine learning methods for postprocessing the data obtained from randomized measurements for efficient characterisation of (approximate) quantum state k designs is applicable to any noisy quantum platform that can generate quantum designs.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks are important for quantum communication, enabling tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and quantum error correction, often utilizing graph states, a specific class of multipartite entangled states that can be represented by graphs. We propose a novel approach for distributing graph states across a quantum network. We show that the distribution of graph states can be characterized by a system of subgraph complementations, which we also relate to the minimum rank of the underlying graph and the degree of entanglement quantified by the Schmidt-rank of the quantum state. We analyze resource usage for our algorithm and show that it improves on the number of qubits, bits for classical communication, and EPR pairs utilized, as compared to prior work. In fact, the number of local operations and resource consumption for our approach scales linearly in the number of vertices. This produces a quadratic improvement in completion time for several classes of graph states represented by dense graphs, which translates into an exponential improvement by allowing parallelization of gate operations. This leads to improved fidelities in the presence of noisy operations, as we show through simulation in the presence of noisy operations. We classify common classes of graph states, along with their optimal distribution time using subgraph complementations. We find a sequence of subgraph complementation operations to distribute an arbitrary graph state which we conjecture is close to the optimal sequence, and establish upper bounds on distribution time along with providing approximate greedy algorithms.</p>

We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics 'scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Tan Xue, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from topologically protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems, especially for flat-band edge states. Departing from previous literature which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems. Gapless 2D flat-band edge states, however, exhibit novel $S_A\sim -\frac{1}{2}L_y^2\log L$ entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension $L_y$, independent of system parameters. This dramatically negative scaling can be traced to a new mechanism known as non-Hermitian critical skin compression (nHCSC), where topological and skin localization in one direction produces a hierarchy of extensively many probability non-conserving entanglement eigenstates across a cut in another direction. Our discovery sheds light on new avenues where topology interplays with criticality and non-Hermitian localization, unrelated to traditional notions of topological entanglement entropy. This topologically protected negative entanglement also manifests in the second Rényi entropy, which can be measured through SWAP operator expectation values.</p>

            <h2>Cauchy-Schwarz and Bell Inequality Violations in Coupled Optomechanical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joy Ghosh, Shailendra K. Varshney, Kapil Debnath</p>
            <p>Destructive interference-based photon-phonon antibunching can lead to violations of classical inequalities in optomechanical cavity systems. In this paper, we explore the violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by examining second-order auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions, as well as Bell's nonlocality, to analyze the quantum correlations of single photon-phonon excitations when the system is driven by two weak probe fields. We propose that the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can serve as an indicator for the stronger nonclassical tests associated with Bell's theorem. Our system reveals strong quantum correlations of photon-phonon pairs with distinctive antidiagonal patterns of photon filtering. For numerical analysis, we consider a weak effective optomechanical coupling strength and various optical-to-mechanical field amplitude ratios that enable unconventional photon (phonon) blockades at resonance. The findings are significant for producing sub-Poissonian signals under optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for generating on-demand single photon-phonon pairs.</p>

            <h2>Practical Few-Atom Quantum Reservoir Computing</h2>

            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana Belén Sainz, Paul Skrzypczyk, Matty J. Hoban</p>
            <p>There are possible physical theories that give greater violations of Bell's inequalities than the corresponding Tsirelson bound, termed post-quantum non-locality. Such theories do not violate special relativity, but could give an advantage in certain information processing tasks. There is another way in which entangled quantum states exhibit non-classical phenomena, with one notable example being Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering; a violation of a bipartite Bell inequality implies EPR steering, but the converse is not necessarily true. The study of post-quantum EPR steering is more intricate, but it has been shown that it does not always imply post-quantum non-locality in a conventional Bell test. In this work we show how to distribute resources in a larger network that individually do not demonstrate post-quantum non-locality but violate a Tsirelson bound for the network. That is, we show how to activate post-quantum steering so that it can now be witnessed as post-quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. One element of our work that may be of independent interest is we show how to self-test a bipartite quantum assemblage in a network, even assuming post-quantum resources.</p>

            <p>While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</p>

            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing as few as five atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurement. The system is conveniently scalable, as newly added atoms naturally couple with existing ones via the shared cavity field. To achieve high computational expressivity with a minimal reservoir, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its internal quantum hardware, while polynomial regression nonlinearly enhances output resolution. We demonstrate significant QRC performance in memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsh Gupta, Mainak Bhattacharyya, Ritik Jain, Ankur Raina</p>
            <p>The reliability of quantum computation critically depends on the performance of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), which can be severely degraded by hook errors that reduce the effective code distance. In this work, we construct a family of $[[n,1,3]]$ non-CSS QECCs to achieve fault-tolerant (FT) syndrome measurement, where $ 6 \leq n \leq 10$. We employ the bare-ancilla method of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} to demonstrate fault tolerance in the presence of hook errors during syndrome extraction. We present a systematic protocol for generating these QECCs using graph codes. Using a custom lookup-table decoder, we simulate the code's performance under both anisotropic and circuit-level depolarizing noise. Our results reveal a trade-off in performance with respect to the code rate and identify optimized codes under these noise models. We benchmark our results against the infamous flag-qubit method of Chao \emph{et al.}. Notably, we introduce a code with improved code rate while maintaining the same distance as the work of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} Our approach facilitates the identification and construction of a family of distance three FT non-CSS QECCs.</p>

            <p>Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.</p>

Our approach maintains a constant distillation rate equal to the code rate while requiring no additional overhead beyond the physical qubits of the code. Full circuit-level analysis demonstrates fault-tolerance for input Bell pair infidelities below a threshold $\sim 10\%$, readily achievable with near-term capabilities. Unlike previous proposals, our scheme keeps the output Bell pairs encoded in qLDPC codes at each node, eliminating un-encoding overhead and enabling direct use in distributed quantum applications through recent advances in qLDPC computation. These results establish qLDPC-based distillation as a practical route toward resource-efficient quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alisson Tezzin, Bárbara Amaral, Jonte R. Hance</p>
            <p>Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of Lüders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</p>

            <p>We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system and are applicable to both near-term and large-scale quantum processors.</p>

Crucially, we show how to efficiently optimize multicopy witnesses to desired states, which is a current challenge. As an example of both theoretical and experimental interest, existing trace polynomial witnesses are significantly improved while preserving their symmetries and implementability with randomized measurements. Besides detecting entanglement, we also find new witnesses detecting $k$-copy distillability. A recipe for the single-copy case is shown to be effective for generic and Werner states.</p>

            <p>Seismic inversion-including post-stack, pre-stack, and full waveform inversion is compute and memory-intensive. Recently, several approaches, including physics-informed machine learning, have been developed to address some of these limitations. Motivated by the potential of quantum computing, we report on our attempt to map one such classical physics-informed algorithm to a quantum framework. The primary goal is to investigate the technical challenges of this mapping, given that quantum algorithms rely on computing principles fundamentally different from those in classical computing. Quantum computers operate using qubits, which exploit superposition and entanglement, offering the potential to solve classically intractable problems. While current quantum hardware is limited, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms-particularly in quantum machine learning (QML)-demonstrate potential for near-term applications and can be readily simulated. We apply QML to subsurface imaging through the development of a hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQ-PINN) for post-stack and pre-stack seismic inversion. The HQ-PINN architecture adopts an encoder-decoder structure: a hybrid quantum neural network encoder estimates P- and S-impedances from seismic data, while the decoder reconstructs seismic responses using geophysical relationships. Training is guided by minimizing the misfit between the input and reconstructed seismic traces. We systematically assess the impact of quantum layer design, differentiation strategies, and simulator backends on inversion performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through the inversion of both synthetic and the Sleipner field datasets. The HQ-PINN framework consistently yields accurate results, showcasing quantum computing's promise for geosciences and paving the way for future quantum-enhanced geophysical workflows.</p>

We compare classical convolutional neural networks (CCNNs), quantum or quantum convolutional neural networks (QNNs, QCNNs), and hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (Hybrid NNs) by assessing their performance based on round-robin matches. Our results show that the Hybrid NNs engines achieve Elo ratings comparable to those of CCNNs engines, while the quantum engines underperform under current hardware constraints. Additionally, we implement a QNN integrated with quantum communication and evaluate its performance to quantify the overhead introduced by noisy quantum channels, and the communication overhead was found to be modest. These results demonstrate the viability of using game-based benchmarks for evaluating quantum computing systems and suggest that quantum communication can be incorporated with limited impact on performance, providing a foundation for future hybrid quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Emitter in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj</p>
            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the primary methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work presents a detailed theoretical investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an emitter in a doubly resonant cavity. The system is modeled by the Lindblad master Equation, and an approximate analytical solution is derived to determine the experimentally achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. Additionally, the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits are also identified. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency is approximately 35%, which is significantly higher than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Mandel Q parameter, revealing highly bunched two-photon emission and super-Poissonian statistics. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and its spectrum consists of three prominent peaks corresponding to transitions between the dressed states of the system.</p>

            <p>Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</p>

Using a resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect significant shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously, which is a direct manifestation of physics beyond the hitherto explored regime of cavity-cold atom interaction with only single or few longitudinal modes at a time. For the cavity mode closest to the atomic resonance, we demonstrate a bistability in the transmission spectrum, arising due to a combined coupling of the cloud to an external pump laser and a cavity mode probed by the optical frequency comb. These results establish a platform for deeper exploration of multifrequency cavity quantum electrodynamics, where ultrashort pulsed sources can be used for optical manipulation, cooling and entanglement of cold atoms in a resonator.</p>

            <p>As quantum computing progresses towards the early fault-tolerant regime, quantum error correction will play a crucial role in protecting qubits and enabling logical Clifford operations. However, the number of logical qubits will initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks like magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient methods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle rotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these constraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an approach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error mitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded magic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. We identify evolution time regimes where MMD outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis techniques in the number of noisy encoded magic states required for square lattices up to size $8 \times 8$. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage that is quantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements for small-angle rotations over classical simulators. This work paves the way for early fault-tolerant demonstrations on devices supporting millions of quantum operations, the so-called MegaQuOp regime.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of few subradiant right eigenstates that are spectrally isolated and spatially localized in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties.

            <p>Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting entanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most of the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear entanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over continuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This procedure effectively "bends" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses into curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled states. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive semi-definiteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a hierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this construction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally to arbitrary Positive but not Completely Positive (PnCP) maps, leading to nonlinear analogues of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the required measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear criteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local operator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in detecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the construction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant enhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Testing Distinguishability and Determinism in Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark G. Raizen</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze experiments to test distinguishability and determinism in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if atoms are distinguishable from each other due to small differences in the nuclear magnetic moment. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for stable isotopes that are confined to ion traps, by accumulating statistics over time with different atoms. The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number of protons and neutrons. We then consider the possibility of performing the same tests on newly created stable isotopes. We also propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of thulium-170 is considered, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.</p>

Performing state measurements in a 3D cooling configuration enables repeated low loss measurements. A theoretical analysis of an extension of the demonstrated approach based on quenching of the excited state with an auxiliary field, identifies parameters for hyperfine-resolved measurements with a projected fidelity of $\sim 0.9995 $ in $\sim 60~\mu\rm s$.</p>

This describes an overall cyclic evolution in state space. Using counterdiabatic terms, the resulting composed fast evolution can be repeated many times. We then analyze the control of Berry's phase along the adiabatic cyclic path and show that Berry's phase can act as a sensitive detector of non-perfect state transfer.</p>

Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces.

            <h2>Quantum Sensing with Bright Two-Mode Squeezed Light in a Distributed Network of Gyroscopes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyanka M. Kannath, Girish S. Agarwal, Ashok Kumar</p>
            <p>Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>On the Design of Expressive and Trainable Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Xiao Tao, Xin Wang, Re-Bing Wu</p>
            <p>Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that avoids barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving trainability. We establish a necessary condition pertaining to the system's initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings provide a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that balance expressivity and trainability.</p>

            <h2>Mutually equi-biased bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Javad Akhtarshenas, Saman Karimi, Mahdi Salehi</p>
            <p>In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one basis gives \emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another basis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes to be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution $q=(q_0,\ldots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is preserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any preparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is chosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect to the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of this, we define the notion of \emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such that within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of the other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to each other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual equi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading for $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\le\mu \le 1/2$ where $\mu=\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements in MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective measurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty inequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated entanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed from MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same number of bases, for certain values of the index $\mu$, employing a larger set of MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic states of a $3\times 3$ system. Our results reveal that not all bases in a set of $L$ MEBs can have contribution for the entanglement detection. ...</p>

            <p>Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs) offer a physically grounded approach to secure authentication, extending the capabilities of classical PUFs. This review covers their theoretical foundations and key implementation challenges - such as quantum memories and Haar-randomness -, and distinguishes QPUFs from Quantum Readout PUFs (QR-PUFs), more experimentally accessible yet less robust against quantum-capable adversaries. A co-citation-based selection method is employed to trace the evolution of QPUF architectures, from early QR-PUFs to more recent Hybrid PUFs (HPUFs). This method further supports a discussion on the role of information-theoretic analysis in mitigating inconsistencies in QPUF responses, underscoring the deep connection between secret-key generation and authentication. Despite notable advances, achieving practical and robust QPUF-based authentication remains an open challenge.</p>

            <p>Operating superconducting qubits at elevated temperatures offers increased cooling power and thus system scalability, but requires suppression of thermal photons to preserve coherence and readout fidelity. This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20~GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Fang, Masahito Hayashi</p>
            <p>We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and identically distributed case to encompass composite correlated hypotheses. In particular, we introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their equivalence or quantitative relations. In the error exponent regime, we generalize the quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum states, demonstrating that the optimal Type-I error exponent, under an exponential constraint on the Type-II error, is precisely characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong converse exponent regime, we provide a general lower bound on the exponent in terms of the regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence and a matching upper bound when the null hypothesis is a singleton. The generality of these results enables applications in various contexts, including (i) refining the generalized quantum Stein's lemma by [Fang, Fawzi & Fawzi, 2024]; (ii) exhibiting counterexamples to the continuity of the regularized Petz Rényi divergence and Hoeffding divergence; (iii) obtaining error exponents for adversarial channel discrimination and resource detection problems.</p>

The ability to control and monitor the rotational dynamics of molecular rotors inside the superfluid medium may shed new light on superfluidity and the interaction of superfluids with defects at the atomic level.</p>

Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangjing Dong, Fengning Ou, Penghui Yao</p>
            <p>Shallow quantum circuits have attracted increasing attention in recent years, due to the fact that current noisy quantum hardware can only perform faithful quantum computation for a short amount of time. The constant-depth quantum circuits $\mathbf{QAC}^0$, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits, are the polynomial-size and constant-depth quantum circuits composed of only single-qubit unitaries and polynomial-size generalized Toffoli gates. The computational power of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we are concerned with $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ circuits, which are linear-size $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{LC}^0$. * We show that depth-$d$ $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits working on $n$ input qubits and $a$ ancilla qubits have approximate degree at most $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-2^{-d}})$, improving the $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-3^{-d}})$ degree upper bound of previous works. Consequently, this directly implies that to compute the parity function, $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits need at least $\tilde{O}(n^{1+2^{-d}})$ circuit size. * We present the first agnostic learning algorithm for $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channels using subexponential running time and queries. Moreover, we also establish exponential lower bounds on the query complexity of learning $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ channels under both the spectral norm distance of the Choi matrix and the diamond norm distance. * We present a tolerant testing algorithm which determines whether an unknown quantum channel is a $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channel. This tolerant testing algorithm is based on our agnostic learning algorithm. Our approach leverages low-degree approximations of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits and Pauli analysis as key technical tools. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of agnostic learning for shallow quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</p>

            <p>One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently samplable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In this setting we can hope to construct efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verification of classical/quantum distributions with classical/quantum cryptography, showing the following results: (1). Classically efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable if and only if one-way functions do not exist. (2). Quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable by $\mathbf{P}^\mathbf{PP}$ with a polynomial number of samples. (3). Sampling-based quantum advantage can be verified quantumly (with a polynomial number of samples) if one-way puzzles do not exist. (4). If QEFID pairs exist, then some quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are not verifiable.</p>

The algorithm utilises the reconfigurability of the integrated photonic circuits to complete one iteration of phase stabilisation in just two measurement rounds for an arbitrary number of modes, and requires no additional hardware to the quantum measurements it enables. As a result, we are able to perform complete quantum state tomography across two chips using the minimum number of local projective measurements to verify the fidelity of the distributed entangled state to be 86% (compared to 8.1% without the phase stabilisation) with an entanglement entropy of 0.995+/-0.002.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liron Mor Yosef, Haim Avron</p>
            <p>Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations. Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b) low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli matrices.</p>

            <p>We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</p>

Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

            <h2>A No-Go Theorem for Shaping Quantum Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Alperin</p>
            <p>The ability to engineer non-Gaussian quantum resources underlies quantum technologies from communication and metrology to universal computation. However, while a number of canonical works have set no-go limits for attaining such resources from Gaussian operations, it is widely assumed that such resources can be tuned freely by non-Gaussian Hamiltonian dynamics. Here we prove a general no-go theorem for such resource shaping: no smooth Hamiltonian dynamics can modify higher-order statistical moments of a continuous-variable state without simultaneously changing its mean and covariance. This analytic constraint implies a rigidity theorem for Hamiltonian quantum control-only quadratic (symplectic) generators preserve the Gaussian moment hierarchy, while every non-quadratic term necessarily couples the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. The theorem identifies the symplectic algebra as the unique invariant subalgebra whose differential representations terminate at finite (second) order within the otherwise infinite Hamiltonian algebra. It thereby defines the analytic boundary between classically simulable Gaussian dynamics and the fully universal non-Gaussian regime-the continuous-variable analogue of the Gottesman-Knill frontier.</p>

            <h2>High-fidelity all-microwave CZ gate with partial erasure-error detection via a transmon coupler</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shotaro Shirai, Shinichi Inoue, Shuhei Tamate, Rui Li, Yasunobu Nakamura, Atsushi Noguchi</p>
            <p>Entangling gates between neighboring physical qubits are essential for quantum error correction. Implementing them in an all-microwave manner simplifies signal routing and control apparatus of superconducting quantum processors. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-microwave controlled-Z (CZ) gate that achieves high fidelity while suppressing residual ZZ interactions. Our approach utilizes a fixed-frequency transmon coupler and multi-path coupling, thereby sufficiently reducing the net transverse interaction between data transmons to suppress residual ZZ interactions. The controlled phase arises from the dispersive frequency shift of the $|gf\rangle$$\unicode{x2013}$$|eg\rangle$ transition between the coupler and one of the data transmons conditioned on the state of the other data transmon. Driving the transitions at the midpoint of two dispersively shifted resonance frequencies induces state-dependent geometric phases to achieve the CZ gate. Crucially, with this scheme, we can maintain a small net transverse interaction between two data transmons while increasing the coupling between the data and coupler transmons to accelerate the CZ-gate speed. Additionally, we measure the coupler state after the gate to detect a subset of decoherence-induced failures that occur during the gate operation. These events constitute erasure errors with known locations, enabling erasure-aware quantum error-correcting codes to improve future logical qubit performance.</p>

            <h2>Qubit Mapping and Routing tailored to Advanced Quantum ISAs: Not as Costly as You Think</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaohui Yang, Kai Zhang, Xinyang Tian, Xiangyu Ren, Yingjian Liu, Yunfeng Li, Dawei Ding, Jianxin Chen, Yuan Xie</p>
            <p>Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-CX-unrolled SWAP insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported by physical devices. Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard CX-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as SQiSW and ZZ({\theta}) gates offer superior circuit synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However, systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are lacking. To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit canonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost for more intelligent SWAP insertion during the routing stage. We also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based optimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing overhead by 15%-35% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different ISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid action Reinforcement Learning for quantum architecture search</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayang Niu, Yan Wang, Jie Li, Ke Deng, Azadeh Alavi, Mark Sanderson, Yongli Ren</p>
            <p>Designing expressive yet trainable quantum circuit architectures remains a major challenge for variational quantum algorithms, as manual or heuristic designs often yield suboptimal performance. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified framework that integrates discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within a hybrid action space. Unlike existing approaches that optimize circuit structure and parameters separately, HyRLQAS jointly learns both topology and initialization while dynamically refining previously placed gates through reinforcement learning. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) environment, the agent autonomously constructs circuits that minimize molecular ground-state energy. Experimental results demonstrate that HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower energy errors and more compact circuit structures compared with discrete-only and continuous-only baselines. Furthermore, the hybrid action space yields superior parameter initializations, producing post-optimization energy distributions with consistently lower minima. These findings suggest that hybrid-action reinforcement learning offers a principled pathway toward automated and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.</p>

            <h2>Revocation and Reconstruction of Shared Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Mudholkar, Chiranjeevi Vanarasa, Indranil Chakrabarty, Srinathan Kannan</p>
            <p>The problem of revocation of quantum states after sharing is interesting and we ask: Is it possible for a dealer to revoke the state once shared, before the reconstruction process? Additional resources like bell states are used to help the dealer to get back the state. In a three-party scenario, we show an independent way to revoke, if, for any reason, the dealer is not sure about the intention of the/any reconstructor. In general, the classical outcomes of the dealer in sharing phase are needed, to be able to reconstruct the state perfectly. When both the shareholders are dishonest, and without the dealer's knowledge, collude to reconstruct, they always have some chance of succeeding. This is addressed by giving more control to the dealer by making him/her) to have a quantum share as well. We give a sharing and revocation protocol with a four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the dealer and one each with the shareholders). We further consider a class of four qubit pure entangled states as resource and explicitly find the range of parameters for which the protocol will be successful.</p>

            <p>We characterize the spectroscopic and coherence properties of the 1451.37 nm excited-state zero-phonon line (ZPL) between the $^{3}F_{4}$ and the $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds of a thulium-doped yttrium aluminum perovskite ($\text{Tm}^{3+}$:$\text{YAlO}_{3}$) crystal at temperatures around 1.5 K. We measure the absorption spectrum between the $^{3}H_{6}$ - $^{3}F_{4}$ and $^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds, the inhomogeneous broadening of the $^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ (excited-state) ZPL, and the lifetimes of the higher-lying and lower-lying excited states. We also investigate spectral hole-burning spectra with varying magnetic fields, which provides insight into hyperfine and superhyperfine interactions. Using again spectral holes but also optical free induction decays (FIDs), we assess optical coherence times, finding a maximum of 1.1 $\mu s$ when a 2T magnetic field is applied. Our results -- the first to demonstrate coherence of an excited-state transition in a rare-earth crystal -- suggest the possibility of exploiting such transitions for quantum technology.</p>

            <h2>On the success probability of the quantum algorithm for the short DLP</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Ekerå</p>
            <p>Ekerå and Håstad have introduced a variation of Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). Unlike Shor's original algorithm, Ekerå-Håstad's algorithm solves the short DLP in groups of unknown order. In this work, we prove a lower bound on the probability of Ekerå-Håstad's algorithm recovering the short logarithm $d$ in a single run. By our bound, the success probability can easily be pushed as high as $1 - 10^{-10}$ for any short $d$. A key to achieving such a high success probability is to efficiently perform a limited search in the classical post-processing by leveraging meet-in-the-middle techniques. Asymptotically, in the limit as the bit length $m$ of $d$ tends to infinity, the success probability tends to one if the limits on the search space are parameterized in $m$. Our results are directly applicable to Diffie-Hellman in safe-prime groups with short exponents, and to RSA via a reduction from the RSA integer factoring problem (IFP) to the short DLP.</p>

            <p>Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases protected by reflection symmetry.

As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity.

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is encoded in a specific microscopic pattern of density waves and phase excitations that can be addressed within the experimental cold atoms capabilities. This work paves the way for tunable amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing. At the same time, our analysis provides the microscopic explanation of the general notion of parametric amplification occurring in nonlinear coherent devices.</p>

We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations - strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays.

            <p>We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent $z$. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of Krylov complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values of the Lanczos coefficients dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems. We further find that increasing the Lifshitz exponent $z$ suppresses Krylov complexity, entropy, and Lanczos growth in both massless and massive cases, while enhancing K-variance. This trend reverses under a hard UV cutoff, where complexity and entropy increase with $z$. In lattice models, early-time complexity and $b_n$ decay shift with $z$, echoing the continuum behavior of massive and massless regimes.</p>

            <h2>General Signal Model and Capacity Limit for Rydberg Quantum Information System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jieao Zhu, Linglong Dai</p>
            <p>Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance.</p>

            <p>We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</p>

When preparing the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion coupling mediated by the interactions.</p>

            <p>Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</p>

The H$_2^+$ ions are created by resonant two-photon excitation of H$_2$ molecules from the $X\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state to the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state, followed by non-resonant one-photon ionization. The H$_2^+$ ions are produced from residual gas and sympathetically cooled by a co-trapped, laser-cooled $^9$Be$^+$ ion. By tuning the wavelength of the REMPI laser, we observe the loading of single H$_2^+$ ions via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 0, 1, 2, 3$) rovibrational levels of the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ intermediate state. We measure the success probability for the production of H$_2^+$ in the ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 1$) state via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 1$) level to be 85(6)% by quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) of the hyperfine structure of this rovibrational state. Furthermore, we load an H$_2^+$ ion via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 2$) level and confirm its rovibrational state to be ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 2$) by QLS. We perform QLS probes on the ion over 19 h and observe no decay of the rotationally excited state.

            <p>Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.</p>

            <h2>Isolated quantum-state networks in ultracold molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom R. Hepworth, Simon L. Cornish, Philip D. Gregory</p>
            <p>Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Pascual Solis, Alex Windey, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Andrea Legramandi, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle DeBry, Agustin Valdes-Martinez, David Reens, Colin D. Bruzewicz, John Chiaverini</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a trapped-ion protocol in which a nearby, dedicated "monitor" qubit tracks magnetic-field drifts in real time without interrupting data-qubit operations. Using two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ions and the optical--metastable--ground architecture, we encode the data qubit in the ground-state manifold and the monitor qubit in a metastable-state manifold to achieve spectral separation. The monitor qubit senses common magnetic fluctuations during data-qubit experiments, enabling feedforward corrections to the qubit-control drives. Under applied magnetic noise with a realistic spectrum ($1/f^{2}$), the protocol maintains coherence and, when compared with interleaved calibration, it extends usable data-qubit probe times by up to a factor of ${\sim}\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the experimental duty cycle. These results establish monitor qubits as a scalable tool for real-time recalibration in quantum information processors.</p>

            <h2>Ballistic bosonic noise suppression with hybrid qumode-qubit rotation gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurabh U. Shringarpure, Siheon Park, Sungjoo Cho, Yong Siah Teo, Hyukjoon Kwon, Srikrishna Omkar, Hyunseok Jeong</p>
            <p>Noise suppression is of paramount importance for reliable quantum information processing and computation. We show that for any single-mode bosonic code (qumode) corrupted by thermal~noise at rate~$\eta$ and mean \mbox{excitation}~$\bar{n}$, a hybrid continuous-discrete-variable~(CV-DV) interferometer using only a single qubit ancilla~(DV) and two controlled~Fourier~(CF) gates sandwiching the noise channel suppresses its effects to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$ \emph{without} any active error correction or destructive measurements of the encoded state and with high success probabilities~$>0.5$ if~$\eta(1+\bar{n})<0.5$. This suppression scheme works by conditionally monitoring the photon-number parities after the interferometer. Bosonic codes with two logical states of the same photon-number parity (like-parity codes) are \emph{completely resilient} to DV amplitude- and phase-damping ancilla noise. For such codes, the interferometer simplifies to the use of a qumode rotation gate and a \emph{single} CF~gate. This presents a clear advantage of our CF-gate-based error suppression scheme over previously-proposed ``bypass'' protocols, where qubit information transferred to the DV mode is readily corrupted by damping~noise. Finally, we present a simple extension to direct communication of qumode states between two parties over a noisy channel using a preshared DV entangled state, by implementing a CF gate in the first laboratory and its inverse in the other. Such a communication protocol achieves a similar fidelity performance at the same success rate as the single-party case, but with greater resilience to the ancilla noise than DV~teleportation. Resource-efficient multi-qubit codes that depend on a few essential long-range interactions can benefit from it.</p>

            <h2>Programmable Adiabatic Rapid Passage laser pulses for Ultra-fast Gates on trapped ions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> En-Teng An, Hao-Qing Zhang, Yun-Feng Huang, Chuan-Feng Li, Jin-Ming Cui</p>
            <p>Scaling of quantum gates remains a central challenge in quantum information science. Ultrafast gates based on spin-dependent kicks provide a promising approach for trapped-ion systems. However, these gates require laser pulses with both high temporal tunability and stability, which are difficult to achieve with existing pulsed sources. Here, we propose a programmable pulsed source that allows flexible control of pulse intensity, waveform, and phase profiles. This enables precise manipulation of pulse sequences, thereby improving the fidelity of entangling gates. Furthermore, since the pulse parameters can be conveniently tuned, various coherent population-transfer schemes can be implemented adiabatic SDKs, thereby improving both the fidelity and robustness of fast quantum gate. Simulation results show that our programmable pulse system can achieve gate fidelities above 99.99% with strong robustness against variations in pulse intensity and single-photon detuning using stimulated Raman adiabatic rapid passage (STIRARP) protocols.</p>

            <h2>On the Origin of the Hidden Symmetry in the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Tong Yang, Song-Ming Chen, Hong-Gang Luo</p>
            <p>The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system. Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$ satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states. Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.</p>

            <h2>Universal and Tunable Sudden Freezing of Entanglement Volume</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luchang Niu, Joseph H. Eberly</p>
            <p>In a system where two identical two-level atoms interact with their common one-mode cavity field, it is shown that entanglement can become abruptly frozen in time, remaining at a constant value for a period of time until it begins to thaw from this value from the entanglement sharing perspective [Ding et al., Phys. Rev. A 103, 032418 (2021)]. We generalize this exotic behavior of entanglement sharing dynamics to more general systems with arbitrary N qubits, instead of restricting to the atom-cavity mode interaction system. We also demonstrate methods to control the entanglement freezing time and freezing value, and we discover a nontrivial dynamics where entanglement is frozen permanently. In addition, we show that this phenomenon is not a coincidence but a universal feature in a variety of systems with a geometric explanation of the mechanisms.</p>

In this article, we extend the protocol and provide additional details of the analysis. Particularly, we compare a double-click and single-click approaches for the ion edge nodes. The double-click approach relaxes the phase stability requirement but is strongly affected by finite efficiencies. Choosing the optimal protocol thus depends on the access to the phase stabilization as well as the efficiency of interface of the ions and ensemble-based memories.</p>

            <p>Quantum steering is a crucial quantum resource that lies intermediate between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. Gaussian channels, meanwhile, play a foundational role in diverse quantum protocols, secure communication, and related fields. In this paper, we focus on several classes of Gaussian channels associated with quantum steering: Gaussian steering-annihilating channels, Gaussian steering-breaking channels, Gaussian unsteerable channels, and maximal Gaussian unsteerable channels. We give the concepts of these channels, derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Gaussian channel to belong to each class, and explore the intrinsic relationships among them. Additionally, since quantifying the steering capability of Gaussian channels in continuous-variable systems requires an understanding of the structure of free superchannels, we also provide a detailed characterization of Gaussian unsteerable superchannels and maximal Gaussian unsteerable superchannels.</p>

            <p>Although multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terahertz (THz) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is theoretically secure, practical vulnerabilities may arise due to detector imperfections. This paper explores a CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD system operating at THz frequencies within a MIMO framework. In this system, measurement is delegated to an untrusted third party, Charlie, rather than the receiver, eliminating all detector attacks and significantly enhancing the system's practical security. Using transmit-receive beamforming techniques, the system transforms MIMO channels into multiple parallel lossy quantum channels, enabling robust key distribution between Alice and Bob. This study examines entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure protocols, deriving secret key rates for both asymptotic and finite code scenarios. Simulations reveal the critical role of multiple antenna configurations and efficient homodyne detection in mitigating free-space path loss and maximizing key rates. Results indicate that system performance is optimized at lower THz frequencies for long-range transmissions and higher frequencies for short-range applications. The proposed protocol offers a scalable solution for secure quantum communications in next-generation wireless networks, demonstrating potential for deployment in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p>

            <h2>Channel Superposition Mitigates Photon Loss Errors in Quantum Illumination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Li, Xiao-Wei Li, Oscar Dahlsten</p>
            <p>In quantum illumination, the probe photon is entangled with an ancilla photon, and both are jointly measured at the end. The entanglement between the probe and ancilla photons enhances the detection performance per unit average photon number in the probe mode, particularly in low-reflectivity and high-noise scenarios. However, photon loss severely limits the practical advantage of such protocols. To address this, we employ a channel superposition framework, which encompasses two kinds of channel superposition protocols: indefinite causal order (ICO) and path superposition with disjoint environment (PS-DE). Our analytical and numerical analysis based on the quantum Chernoff bound shows that both ICO and PS-DE can, in principle, achieve an advantage. The advantage persists as long as non-zero interference remains, reverting to the performance of standard quantum illumination once the interference is completely suppressed. Crucially, the ICO protocol is significantly more robust, maintaining a tighter upper bound on the error probability than standard quantum illumination and the PS-DE approach. This performance hierarchy is rooted in their fundamental structures: ICO exploits a shared environment to generate stronger quantum interference, while PS-DE, relying on disjoint environments, offers a more experimentally tractable albeit less potent alternative.</p>

            <h2>Robust Quantum Teleportation Against Noise Using Weak Measurement and Flip Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Dhanik, Shraddha Sharma, Pitamber Mahanandia</p>
            <p>This study presents an improved quantum teleportation protocol designed to enhance fidelity in noisy environments by combining weak measurements (WMs) with flip and reversal operations. In our scheme, Alice prepares a four-qubit entangled state and shares one of the entangled qubits with Bob, which serves as the quantum channel for teleporting an arbitrary single-qubit state. Since the communication channel is subject to noise, Alice performs a weak measurement on the shared qubit before transmission to reduce the impact of decoherence. Building upon existing WM-flip-reversal frameworks, we propose a modified weak measurement and reversal (WMR) protocol tailored for different noises in a four-qubit entangled system. The approach applies WM and flip operations prior to transmission to enhance resilience against noise, followed by corresponding reversal operations after transmission to recover the original quantum state. We systematically compare the performance of our proposed WMR protocol with the previously proposed WM-flip-reversal method under three common noise models: amplitude damping channel (ADC), phase flip channel (PFC), and bit flip channel (BFC). Our analysis reveals that the modified WMR scheme achieves significantly higher teleportation fidelity and improved robustness, particularly in bit flip noise environments. These findings highlight the potential of optimized weak measurement strategies for developing more reliable and noise-tolerant quantum communication protocols.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhrumil Bhatt, Vidushi Kumar</p>
            <p>The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an \textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($\rho = 10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with network size and remains robust for fading variances up to $\sigma_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global quantum constellations.</p>

For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.</p>

            <p>The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

The CLS form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice. Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation.

            <p>The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide a tutorial treatise on the fundamental research challenges of quantum transduction. The tutorial is structured around a communications engineering framework, thereby shedding light on its fundamental role in quantum network design and deployment- a perspective often overlooked in existing literature. This framework allows us to categorize different transduction modalities and to reveal an unorthodox one where the transducer itself can act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</p>

            <h2>Architecting Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Computers using Surface Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Jones, Prakash Murali (University of Cambridge)</p>
            <p>Trapped ion (TI) qubits are a leading quantum computing platform. Current TI systems have less than 60 qubits, but a modular architecture known as the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) is a promising path to scale up devices. There is a large gap between the error rates of near-term systems ($10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) and the requirements of practical applications (below $10^{-9}$). To bridge this gap, we require Quantum Error Correction (QEC) to build logical qubits that are composed of multiple physical qubits. While logical qubits have been demonstrated on TI qubits, these demonstrations are restricted to small codes and systems. There is no clarity on how QCCD systems should be designed to implement practical-scale QEC. This paper studies how surface codes, a standard QEC scheme, can be implemented efficiently on QCCD-based systems. To examine how architectural parameters of a QCCD system can be tuned for surface codes, we develop a near-optimal topology-aware compilation method that outperforms existing QCCD compilers by an average of 3.8X in terms of logical clock speed. We use this compiler to examine how hardware trap capacity, connectivity and electrode wiring choices can be optimised for surface code implementation. In particular, we demonstrate that small traps of two ions are surprisingly ideal from both a performance-optimal and hardware-efficiency standpoint. This result runs counter to prior intuition that larger traps (20-30 ions) would be preferable, and has the potential to inform design choices for upcoming systems.</p>

Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.</p>

            <h2>Temporal entanglement transition in chaotic quantum many-body dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilya Vilkoviskiy, Michael Sonner, Qi Camm Huang, Wen Wei Ho, Alessio Lerose, Dmitry A. Abanin</p>
            <p>Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</p>

            <h2>Realistic GKP stabilizer states enable universal quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fariba Hosseinynejad, Pavithran Iyer, Guillaume Dauphinais, David L. Feder</p>
            <p>Physical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are inherently noisy as ideal ones would require infinite energy. While this is typically considered as a deficiency to be actively corrected, this work demonstrates that imperfect GKP stabilizer states can be leveraged in order to apply non-Clifford gates using only linear optical elements. In particular, Gaussian operations on normalizable GKP states, combined with homodyne measurements, permit two key primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates in the normalizable GKP codespace, thereby implementing Clifford gates with high fidelity; and probabilistic projection of unmeasured modes onto non-Pauli eigenstates. These results demonstrate that normalizable GKP stabilizer states combined with Gaussian operations provide a practical framework for computational universality within the measurement-based model of quantum computation in a realistic continuous-variable setting.</p>

            <h2>Controlled growth of rare-earth-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films on III-V semiconductors for hybrid quantum photonic interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry C. Hammer, Caleb Whittier, Nathan A. Helvy, Christopher Rouleau, Nabil D. Bassim, Ravitej Uppu</p>
            <p>Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough, polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum photonic chips.</p>

            <p>Quantum imaging is emerging as a transformative approach for biomedical applications, applying nonclassical properties of light, such as entanglement, squeezing, and quantum correlations, to overcome fundamental limits of conventional techniques. These methods promise superior spatial resolution, enhanced signal-to-noise ratios, improved phase sensitivity, and reduced radiation dose, for potentially safer and more precise imaging for delicate biological samples. Here, we present an overview of quantum optical biomedical imaging technologies as well as quantum-inspired imaging methods, including quantum optical coherence tomography, quantum optical microscopy, ghost imaging, multi-parameter quantum imaging, and imaging with quantum-grade cameras. We describe the operating principles, biomedical applications, and unique advantages of each approach, along with the specific challenges for their translation into real-life practice. This review aims to guide future research toward advancing quantum imaging from experimental demonstrations to impactful biomedical tools.</p>

            <h2>Quantum error correction for multiparameter metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mauricio Gutiérrez, Chiranjib Mukhopadhyay, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>For single-parameter sensing, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) probes achieve optimal quantum-enhanced precision across the unknown parameter range, solely relying on parameter-independent separable measurement strategies for all values of the unknown parameter. However, in the multiparameter setting, a single GHZ probe not only fails to achieve quantum advantage but also the corresponding optimal measurement becomes complex and dependent on the unknown parameters. Here, we provide a recipe for multiparameter sensing with GHZ probes using quantum error correction techniques by treating all but one unknown parameters as noise, whose effects can be corrected. This strategy restores the core advantage of single parameter GHZ-based quantum sensing, namely reaching optimally quantum-enhanced precision for all unknown parameter values while keeping the measurements separable and fixed. Specifically, given one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, our protocol extracts optimal possible precision for any probe size. While this optimal precision is shot-noise limited for a single GHZ probe, we recover the Heisenberg scaling through use of multiple complementary GHZ probes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol with Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous heat flow and quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Feng Xue, Qi Zhang, Xu-Cai Zhuang, Yun-Jie Xia, Enrico Russo, Giulio Chiribella, Rosario Lo Franco, Zhong-Xiao Man</p>
            <p>The principle that heat spontaneously flows from higher temperature to lower temperature is a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, often assumed to be independent of the sequence of interactions. While this holds true for macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.</p>

            <h2>Unifying contextual advantages in state discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kieran Flatt, Joonwoo Bae</p>
            <p>Quantum state discrimination, alongside its other applications, has recently found use as a tool for witnessing generalised contextuality. In this article, we derive noncontextuality inequalities for both conclusive and inconclusive outcomes across various guessing strategies. For minimum- error discrimination, the advantage is in terms of the confidences of individual outcomes, while for unambiguous state discrimination, it is in terms of the average guessing probability. For maximum- confidence discrimination, we show that contextual advantages occur not only for the confidence but also their average, the guessing probability, as well as the inconclusive outcome rate. Our results unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and figures of merit. We envisage that various quantum information applications based on state discrimination may offer advantages over non-contextual theories.</p>

            <h2>Controllable Non-Hermitianity in Continuous-Variable Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke-Xiong Yan, Zhi-Cheng Shi, Ye-Hong Chen, Yan Xia</p>
            <p>Pure dephasing is the dominant leak mechanism in photonic cat qubits because its phase errors disrupt the parity protection, rendering the qubit vulnerable to energy relaxation. In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing mechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces \textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and odd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the dynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby transforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for probing non-Hermitian physics. Within this platform, we demonstrate the possibility to control the parity-time symmetry phase transition in a single cat qubit by adjusting its amplitude. Moreover, we couple two cat qubits to realize an entanglement phase transition induced by the exceptional point. Our work constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator, overturning the conventional paradigm that treats dephasing as harmful noise.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Yona, Yaron Oz</p>
            <p>We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Chip Co-Design for Fidelity and Entanglement Preservation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Salmanogli, Hesam Zandi</p>
            <p>This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Engineered Robustness for Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuan Zhang, XIao-le Li, Jingjing Niu, Tongxing Yan, Yuanzhen Chen</p>
            <p>While geometric quantum gates are often theorized to possess intrinsic resilience to control errors by exploiting the global properties of evolution paths, this promise has not consistently translated into practical robustness. We present a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) that incorporates additional auxiliary constraints to suppress dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance. Within this framework, we also design NGQGs using noncyclic paths, offering enhanced design flexibility. Implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, our scheme realizes high-fidelity single-qubit gates that are robust against Rabi amplitude error $\epsilon$, with infidelity scaling as $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ behavior of conventional dynamical gates. We further analyze two-qubit NGQGs under parametric driving. Our results identify subtle limitations that compromise performance in two-qubit scenarios, underscoring the importance of phase compensation and waveform calibration. The demonstrated simplicity and generality of our super-robust NGQG scheme make it applicable across diverse quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Local quantum coherence with intersource interactions at nonzero temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehor Hudenko, Michal Kolář, Radim Filip, Artem Ryabov</p>
            <p>Local quantum coherence in a two-level system (TLS) is typically generated via time-dependent driving. However, it can also emerge autonomously from symmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment at a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting atoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating the autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this gap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS coupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the whole system being in thermal equilibrium. We show that the local coherence not only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures of the environment compared to the case of no inter-source interactions. The temperature dependence of the coherence bears signatures of a quantum phase transition, and our analytical results suggest strategies for its optimization. Our findings reveal generic properties of the autonomously generated quantum coherence and point to viable routes for observing the coherence at nonzero temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Cluster States Generation with a Quantum Metasurface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehonatan Levin, Uri Israeli, Rivka Bekenstein</p>
            <p>We investigate the implementation of photonic cluster state generation protocols using quantum metasurfaces comprising sub-wavelength atomic arrays which enables quantum-controlled reflectivity. These cluster states are generated using fundamental quantum logic gates and enable wide-ranging applications in quantum computation and communication. In the past few years, certain protocols have been developed, but their physical realizations induces natural losses on the system mainly originated from coupling the photonic structures, setting a limit on the efficiency and maximal qubit number. In this paper, we examine a physical implementation of two specific protocols for generating distinct cluster states: a two-dimensional cluster state and a tree cluster state. Our approach leverages the unique properties of a quantum metasurface and its free space settings to implement two-qubit quantum-logic gates, namely CNOT, CZ, and E gates, with practical fidelities exceeding 0.9, and potential speed-up due to parallelism. In addition, we analyze these protocols fidelities for practical conditions of potential implementation experiments, such as thermal fluctuation of trapped atoms.</p>

            <h2>Neutral-atom quantum computation using multi-qubit geometric gates via adiabatic passage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sinchan Snigdha Rej, Bimalendu Deb</p>
            <p>Adiabatic geometric phase gates offer enhanced robustness against fluctuations compared to con- ventional Rydberg blockade-based phase gates that rely on dynamical phase accumulation. We theoretically demonstrate two- and multi-qubit phase gates in a neutral atom architecture, relying on a double stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence that imprints a controllable geometric phase on the qubit systems. The system is designed in such a way that every atom is individually addressable, and moreover, no extra laser is required to be applied on the target atom while scaling up the system from two- to multi-qubit quantum gates. The gate fidelity has been numerically analyzed by changing the gate operation time, and we find that 98% to 99% fidelity can be achieved for gate time $\simeq$ 0.6 $\mu$s. We perform a systematic error analysis, which re- veals that our proposed gates can exhibit strong resilience against fluctuations in Rabi frequencies, finite blockade strength, and atomic position variations. These results establish our approach as a physically feasible and scalable pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation with neutral atoms. We simulate Grover's search algorithm for two-, three-, and four-qubit systems with high success probability and thereby demonstrate the utility and scalability of our proposed gates for quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Single-Ion Atomic-Ensemble Node for High-Rate Remote Entanglement Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benedikt Tissot, Soubhadra Maiti, Emil R. Hellebek, Anders Søndberg Sørensen</p>
            <p>Different quantum systems possess different favorable qualities. On the one hand, ensemble-based quantum memories are suited for fast multiplexed long-range entanglement generation. On the other hand, single-atomic systems provide access to gates for processing of information. Both of those can provide advantages for high-rate entanglement generation within quantum networks. We develop a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of these properties by combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes comprised of spontaneous parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on rare-earth ion ensembles. To this end, we solve the central challenge of matching the different bandwidths of photons emitted by those systems in an initial entanglement-generation step. This enables the parallel execution of multiple probabilistic tasks in the initial stage. We show that our approach can lead to a significant speed-up for the fundamental task of creating ion-ion entanglement over hundreds of kilometers in a quantum network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Gomez Cadavid, Pranav Chandarana, Sebastián V. Romero, Jan Trautmann, Enrique Solano, Taylor Lee Patti, Narendra N. Hegade</p>
            <p>We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.</p>

            <h2>QEF: Reproducible and Exploratory Quantum Software Experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Gierisch, Wolfgang Mauerer</p>
            <p>Commercially available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices now make small hybrid quantum-classical experiments practical, but many tools hide configuration or demand ad-hoc scripting. We introduce the Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF): A lightweight framework designed to support the systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum algorithms. Unlike many existing approaches, QEF emphasises iterative, exploratory analysis of evolving experimental strategies rather than exhaustive empirical evaluation of fixed algorithms using predefined quality metrics. The framework's design is informed by a comprehensive review of the literature, identifying principal parameters and measurement practices currently reported in the field. QEF captures all key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of variants for controlled large-scale parameter sweeps. This design enables rigorous and systematic evaluation, as well as precise reproducibility. Large sweeps are automatically partitioned into asynchronous jobs across simulators or cloud hardware, and ascertain full hyper-parameter traceability. QEF supports parameter reuse to improve overall experiment runtimes, and collects all metrics and metadata into a form that can be conveniently explored with standard statistical and visualisation software. By combining reproducibility and scalability while avoiding the complexities of full workflow engines, QEF seeks to lower the practical barriers to empirical research on quantum algorithms, whether these are designed for current NISQ devices or future error-corrected quantum systems.</p>

We present wideband homodyne detectors operating at near-infrared (NIR) and telecom wavelengths, with optimized performance at repetition rates up to 150 MHz.

            <h2>Controlling Hong-Ou-Mandel antibunching via parity governed spectral shaping of biphoton states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Guselnikov, Alexei D. Kiselev, Andrei Gaidash, George Miroshnichenko, Anton Kozubov</p>
            <p>We investigate into experimentally detectable effects such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching. These regimes can be characterized using the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ that enters the two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}=(1-D_S)/2$. In the case of HOM bunching (antibunching), $D_S$ is positive (negative). Though the symmetry degree can generally be expressed in terms of the difference between the contributions coming from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude (JSA), $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$, for a certain physically realizable class of the JSA, where $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ is proportional to the product of amplitudes $\varphi_1(\omega_1)\varphi_2(\omega_2)$ multiplied by a Gaussian shaped entangling factor, we find the sign of $D_S$ is primarily governed by the parity properties of the spectral function, $\varphi_{12}(\omega)=\varphi_1(\omega)\varphi_2^*(\omega)$. It is the even (odd) part of $\varphi_{12}=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}+\varphi_{12}^{(-)}$ that meets the parity condition $\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\omega-\Omega)=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\Omega-\omega)$ ($\varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\omega-\Omega)=- \varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\Omega-\omega)$) to yield the positive (negative) contribution, $D_S^{(+)}$ ($-D_S^{(-)}$), to the symmetry degree parameter: $D_S=D_S^{(+)}-D_S^{(-)}$. We have shown that switching between the bunching and antibunching regimes can be realized using the experimentally accessible family of modulated biphoton states produced using the spectral phase modulation fine-tuned via the sub-nanometer scale variation of the path length. For this class of modulated states, the Schmidt number has been computed as a function of the modulation parameter. This dependence reveals the structure of narrow resonance peaks strongly correlated with the corresponding narrow dips of the symmetry degree where the HOM antibunching occurs.</p>

            <h2>Automated Discovery of Non-local Photonic Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sören Arlt, Mario Krenn, Xuemei Gu</p>
            <p>Interactions between quantum systems enable quantum gates, the building blocks of quantum information processing. In photonics, direct photon-photon interactions are too weak to be practically useful, so effective interactions are engineered with linear optics and measurement. A central challenge is to realize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain spatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential non-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in both qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by the AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared entanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum indistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent superpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we uncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum teleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements. Technically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical resource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they demonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and techniques in physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Search With Generalized Wildcards</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjan Cornelissen, Nikhil S. Mande, Subhasree Patro, Nithish Raja, Swagato Sanyal</p>
            <p>In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight $O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound. We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a subset $\cal{Q} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S = b$ for an arbitrary $S \in \cal{Q}$ and $b \in \{-1,1\}^S$ of its choice, at unit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\cal{Q}$ is any of the following collections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full set. All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using symmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of learning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization program, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd functions $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$ to the maximum (over $T \in \cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube whose free variables are exactly $T$.' To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal version of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program typically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds without explicitly resorting to SDP duality.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa</p>
            <p>In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Legal Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Godfrey, Ted Sichelman</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.</p>

            <h2>Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaochen Liu, Ken-Tye Yong</p>
            <p>Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4, with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K, respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K. The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and applications at ambient pressure.</p>

            <p>Quarks and gluon, as quantum particles, are subjects to various effects that go beyond the naive parton picture and are not captured by ordinary parton densities. In this work, we investigate the twist-three parton distribution functions, which encode quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states, and for the first time, determine them directly from experimental data. The analysis combines observables described by collinear and transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems within a unified global fit, incorporating a complete leading-order QCD evolution at the twist-three level. The extracted distributions reveal a clear flavor-dependent patterns and distinct from zero at a statistically significant level ($2-3\sigma$). These findings provide the first quantitative evidence for quark-gluon-quark correlations within the proton, revealing its genuinely quantum nature and opening a new direction for precision studies of partonic correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugenia Pyurbeeva, Ronnie Kosloff</p>
            <p>Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.</p>

            <p>We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental target.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as a Dynamical Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyu He, Hao Song</p>
            <p>We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$ are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular, this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior, resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a computational algebraic method using Gröbner bases over the ring of integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.</p>

In this work, we present the first machine learning algorithm with the ability to automatically locate the charge transitions of an ion-implanted donor in a silicon device, tune single-shot charge readout, and identify the gate voltage parameters where tunnelling rates in and out the donor site are the same. The entire tuning pipeline is completed on the order of minutes. Our results enable both automatic characterisation and tuning of a donor in silicon devices faster than human experts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Saharian, L. Sh. Grigoryan, V. Kh. Kotanjyan</p>
            <p>We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region. For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions $D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero. This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.</p>

In parallel, we apply an independent dynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity measurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield consistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured density profiles.</p>

            <h2>Path distributions for describing eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and other 1-dimensional problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Randall M. Feenstra</p>
            <p>The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of a harmonic oscillator, as well as other, simple 1-dimensional problems, is described. Using known, closed-form, path-based propagators for each problem, an integral expression is written that describes the wave function. This expression conventionally takes the form of an integral over initial locations of a particle, but it is re-expressed here in terms of a characteristic momentum associated with motion between the endpoints of a path. In this manner, the resulting expression can be analyzed using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, leading to distributions of paths that exactly describe each eigenstate. These distributions are valid for all travel times, but when evaluated for long times they turn out to be real, non-negative functions of the characteristic momentum. For the harmonic oscillator in particular, a somewhat broad distribution is found, peaked at value of momentum that corresponds to a classical energy which in turn equals the energy eigenvalue for the state being described.</p>

            <p>Ground state preparation is a central application for quantum computers but remains challenging in practice. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the performance and gate counts of double-bracket quantum algorithms (DBQAs) for ground state preparation. We propose a practical strategy in which DBQAs refine initial state preparation circuits, and we compile them for Heisenberg chains using controlled-Z and single-qubit gates. Warm-started DBQAs consistently improve both the energy and ground-state fidelity relative to the initial states provided by variational ansätze, indicating that DBQAs offer an effective unitary synthesis method. To demonstrate compatibility with near-term hardware, we executed a proof-of-concept example on IBM devices. With error mitigation, we observed a statistically significant improvement over the corresponding warm-start circuit. Furthermore, numerical emulations for the same system size indicate that executing DBQAs on Quantinuum's hardware could achieve similar cost-function gains without requiring error mitigation. These findings suggest that DBQAs are a promising approach for enhancing ground-state approximations on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning.

            <p>Warehouses play a central role in industrial logistics, functioning as critical hubs for storing and organizing inventory to support efficient production. Optimizing item allocation within these facilities is essential for reducing operational costs and improving delivery times. In this work, we address the optimization of inventory allocation in warehouses equipped with gravity-flow racks, which are designed for First In, First Out (FIFO) logistics, a configuration that inherently requires item reinsertions during retrieval operations to maintain flow continuity. These reinsertions, however, are time-consuming and costly, so minimizing their occurrence is crucial for operational efficiency. We propose an optimization strategy that simultaneously allocates multiple items, determining their placement across available shelves in a single decision step, explicitly accounting for every item and every shelf in the warehouse. By jointly evaluating multiple items, our approach enables globally optimized placement decisions, minimizing conflicts that arise in sequential methods. The problem is formulated as a QUBO, allowing implementation on both classical metaheuristics and quantum-hybrid solvers. We assess performance by comparing three classical optimization approaches - two variants of Simulated Annealing and the commercial solver Gurobi - with D-Wave's hybrid solver, which uniquely combines quantum annealing with classical metaheuristics. Complementing these benchmarks, a factory-scale simulation based on real operational data shows that considering larger batches of items in the allocation step can significantly reduce reinsertions, highlighting the practical potential of the proposed approach for industrial logistics.</p>

            <p>We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schrödinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</p>

At small mutual laser detunings (<=0.5GHz), the results are accurately described by the pure-state model [Nat. Commun. 16, 6453 (2025)], which treats all resonance-fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission. At larger detunings, we uncover an anomalous feature in the two-photon interference, where the normalised second-order correlation function under orthogonal polarisations yields g2_vert(0) < 0.5.</p>

            <p>Although particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.</p>

            <p>The deterministic and time-reversal symmetric dynamics of isolated quantum systems is at odds with irreversible equilibration observed in generic thermodynamic systems. Standard approaches at a reconciliation employ subjective restrictions on the space of observables or states and do not explain how a single macroscopic quantum system achieves equilibrium dynamically. We instead argue that quantum theory is an effective theory and requires corrections to accurately describe systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. We construct a stochastic extension of quantum theory which is practically identical to quantum mechanics for microscopic systems, yet allows single, isolated macroscopic systems to objectively thermalize, generically. A fluctuation-dissipation relation guarantees physical consistency including norm preservation, energy conservation, no superluminal signalling and the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium. We further discuss the inclusion of objective collapse, thereby realizing a falsifiable theory of spontaneous universal irreversibility which describes the quantum-to-classical crossover dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems. The dynamics of the model describe spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum state reduction and objective quantum thermalization for individual systems while realizing an emergent hybrid statistics for ensembles which interpolates between Born's rules and microcanonical equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Approximate Quadratization of High-Order Hamiltonians for Combinatorial Quantum Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabina Drăgoi, Alberto Baiardi, Daniel J. Egger</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems have wide-ranging applications in industry and academia. Quantum computers may help solve them by sampling from carefully prepared Ansatz quantum circuits. However, current quantum computers are limited by their qubit count, connectivity, and noise. This is particularly restrictive when considering optimization problems beyond the quadratic order. Here, we introduce Ansatze based on an approximate quadratization of high-order Hamiltonians which do not incur a qubit overhead. The price paid is a loss in the quality of the noiseless solution. Crucially, this approximation yields shallower Ansatze which are more robust to noise than the standard QAOA one. We show this through simulations of systems of 8 to 16 qubits with variable noise strengths. Furthermore, we also propose a noise-aware Ansatz design method for quadratic optimization problems. This method implements only part of the corresponding Hamiltonian by limiting the number of layers of SWAP gates in the Ansatz. We find that for both problem types, under noise, our approximate implementation of the full problem structure can significantly enhance the solution quality. Our work opens a path to enhance the solution quality that approximate quantum optimization achieves on noisy hardware.</p>

            <h2>Low-Level and NUMA-Aware Optimization for High-Performance Quantum Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Rezaei, Luc Jaulmes, Maria Bahna, Oliver Thomson Brown, Antonio Barbalace</p>
            <p>Scalable classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for advancing quantum algorithm development and validating emerging hardware. This work focuses on performance enhancements through targeted low-level and NUMA-aware tuning on a single-node system, thereby not only advancing the efficiency of classical quantum simulations but also establishing a foundation for scalable, heterogeneous implementations that bridge toward noiseless quantum computing. Although few prior studies have reported similar hardware-level optimizations, such implementations have not been released as open-source software, limiting independent validation and further development. We introduce an open-source, high-performance extension to the QuEST state vector simulator that integrates state-of-the-art low-level and NUMA-aware optimizations for modern processors. Our approach emphasizes locality-aware computation and incorporates hardware-specific techniques including NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread pinning, AVX-512 vectorization, aggressive loop unrolling, and explicit memory prefetching. Experiments demonstrate substantial speedups--5.5-6.5x for single-qubit gate operations, 4.5x for two-qubit gates, 4x for Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), and 1.8x for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Algorithmic workloads further achieve 4.3-4.6x acceleration for Grover and 2.5x for Shor-like circuits. These results show that systematic, architecture-aware tuning can significantly extend the practical simulation capacity of classical quantum simulators on current hardware.</p>

            <h2>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aabhas Gulati, Ion Nechita, Sang-Jun Park</p>
            <p>This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</p>

            <h2>Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srinivasan Arunachalam, Arkopal Dutt</p>
            <p>We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\epsilon > 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $< \epsilon$. We first show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25]. To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $S$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $S$, output $|\phi\rangle \in S$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C>1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture in the high doubling regime (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25]), we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task. As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $2$ was unknown.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Stárek, Tim Gollerthan, Olga Leskovjanová, Michael Meth, Peter Tirler, Nicolai Friis, Martin Ringbauer, Ladislav Mišta Jr</p>
            <p>A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is, correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</p>

            <h2>Matrix product state approach to lossy boson sampling and noisy IQP sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sojeong Park, Changhun Oh</p>
            <p>Sampling problems have emerged as a central avenue for demonstrating quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, physical noise can fundamentally alter their computational complexity, often making them classically tractable. Motivated by the recent success of matrix product state (MPS)-based classical simulation of Gaussian boson sampling (Oh et al., 2024), we extend this framework to investigate the classical simulability of other noisy quantum sampling models. We develop MPS-based classical algorithms for lossy boson sampling and noisy instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling, both of which retain the tunable accuracy characteristic of the MPS approach through the bond dimension. Our approach constructs pure-state decompositions of noisy or lossy input states whose components remain weakly entangled after circuit evolution, thereby providing a means to systematically explore the boundary between quantum-hard and classically-simulable regimes. For boson sampling, we analyze single-photon, Fock, and cat-state inputs, showing that classical simulability emerges at transmission rates scaling as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, reaching the known boundary of quantum advantage with a tunable and scalable method. Beyond reproducing previous thresholds, our algorithm offers significantly improved control over the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. It further extends the applicability of MPS-based simulation to broader classes of noisy quantum sampling models, including IQP circuits.</p>

            <p>Electromagnetic simulations form an indispensable part of the design and optimization process for superconducting quantum devices. Although several commercial platforms exist, open-source alternatives optimized for high-performance computing remain limited. To address this gap, we introduce SQDMetal, a Python-based API that integrates Qiskit Metal (IBM), Gmsh, Palace (AWS), and Paraview (Kitware) into an open-source, highly parallel simulation workflow for superconducting quantum circuits. SQDMetal enables accurate, efficient, and scalable simulations while remaining community-driven and free from commercial constraints. In this work, we validate SQDMetal through mesh convergence studies which benchmark SQDMetal against COMSOL Multiphysics and Ansys, demonstrating excellent agreement for both eigenmode and electrostatic (capacitance) simulations. Furthermore, we simulate superconducting resonators and transmon qubits, showing reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. SQDMetal also supports advanced capabilities, including Hamiltonian extraction via the energy participation ratio (EPR) method, incorporation of kinetic inductance effects, and full 3D modelling of device geometry for improved predictive accuracy. By unifying open-source tools into a single framework, SQDMetal lowers the barriers to entry for community members seeking to access high-performance simulations to assist in the design and optimization of their devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Calixto, Octavio Castaños</p>
            <p>Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector --measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-- and from correlation functions for a $y$-space partition. The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region. For a real-space partition, the edge-state region in momentum space exhibits lower correlation modulus, but higher correlation arguments, than the bulk-state region.</p>

            <h2>Extended Landauer-Büttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</h2>

            <p>The Landauer-Büttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current.

            <p>In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</p>

While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

            <p>We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</p>

            <p>In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interactions that give rise to gravity, which involve chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. We argue that these SDCs provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical estimate of the value of the cosmological constant, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant that weakens with time, in agreement with some of the recent evidence, and a proposal about how SDCs give rise to gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang, Cecilie Glittum</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. The two results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. We make the first step towards unifying them by studying the quasi-1D lattice of a pyrochlore stripe, where all corners are not shared between two tetrahedra, and the valence bond configurations are not fixed by the location of the vacancy. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</p>

Here, we introduce the interacting Anderson Quantum Sun model, which significantly deviates from these conventional expectations. In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</p>

The behaviors of these quantum correlations differ from those in elementary particle-antiparticle systems such as the top quark and tau lepton due to the polarization effect. The hierarchy of quantum correlations is examined and partially confirmed in hyperon-antihyperon systems: $ \textrm{Bell Nonlocality} \subset \textrm{Steering} \subset \textrm{Entanglement} \subset \text{Discord}$.

            <p>Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Spectral Edge in SYK Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ouyang, Pratik Rath</p>
            <p>Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the continuous spectrum at the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the power-law behaviour of the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</p>

            <h2>Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacek Gȩbala, Michał Tomza, José P. D'Incao</p>
            <p>We calculate bound and scattering properties of a system of two neutral atoms and an ion near an atom-ion Feshbach resonance. Our results indicate that long-range atom-ion interactions lead to significant deviations from universal behavior derived from contact or van der Waals potentials. We find that ionic systems display an overall suppression of inelastic transitions leading to recombination rates and lifetimes of Efimov state orders of magnitude smaller with respect to those for neutral atoms. We further characterize the dense spectra of triatomic molecular ions with extended lifetimes. Our results provide a deeper insight on the universality and structure of three-body ionic systems and establishing them as a promising platform for exploring novel few- and many-body phenomena with long-range interactions.</p>

            <h2>High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elnaz Rostampour, Badie Ghavami</p>
            <p>Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p>

            <h2>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu, Po-Shen Hsin</p>
            <p>A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-König bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-König bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>Zero-Noise Extrapolation via Cyclic Permutations of Quantum Circuit Layouts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahar Sayapin, Daniil Rabinovich, Nikita Korolev, Kirill Lakhmanskiy</p>
            <p>Increasing the utility of currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices requires developing efficient methods to mitigate hardware errors, taking into account the constraints of these devices such as medium number of qubits and limited connectivity between them. In this work we propose a novel Cyclic Layout Permutations based Zero Noise Extrapolation (CLP-ZNE) protocol for such a task. The method leverages the inherent non-uniformity of gate errors in NISQ hardware and exploits symmetries of quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity to extrapolate the expectation value, averaged over cyclic circuit layout permutations, to the level of zero noise. In contrast to the previous layout permutation based approaches, for $n$ qubit circuit CLP-ZNE requires measurements of only $O(n)$ different circuit layouts to reconstruct the noiseless expected value. When benchmarked against noise channels modeling the IBM Torino quantum computer, the method reduces a typical expectation value error by an order of magnitude, depending on the protocol specifications. By employing a noise model derived from real hardware specifications, including both depolarizing and $T_1/T_2$ relaxation processes, these results give evidence for the applicability of CLP-ZNE to present-day NISQ processors.</p>

            <h2>Classical shadows for sample-efficient measurements of gauge-invariant observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Bringewatt, Henry Froland, Andreas Elben, Niklas Mueller</p>
            <p>Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.</p>

            <h2>Correlation Self-Testing of Quantum Theory against Generalised Probabilistic Theories with Restricted Relabelling Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuntal Sengupta, Mirjam Weilenmann, Roger Colbeck</p>
            <p>Correlation self-testing of quantum theory involves identifying a task or set of tasks whose optimal performance can be achieved only by theories that can realise the same set of correlations as quantum theory in every causal structure. Following this approach, previous work has ruled out various classes of generalised probabilistic theories whose joint state spaces have a certain regularity in the sense of a (discrete) rotation symmetry of the bipartite state spaces. Here we consider theories whose bipartite state spaces lack this regularity. We form them by taking the convex hull of all the local states and a finite number of non-local states. We show that a criterion of compositional consistency is needed in such theories: for a measurement effect to be valid, there must exist at least one measurement that it is part of. This goes beyond previous consistency criteria and corresponds to a strengthening of the no-restriction hypothesis. We show that quantum theory outperforms these theories in a task called the adaptive CHSH game, which shows that they can be ruled out experimentally. We further show a connection between compositional consistency and Tsirelson's bound.</p>

            <h2>Motional entanglement in low-energy collisions near shape resonances</h2>

            <p>Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen discussed their paradox in terms of measuring the positions or momenta of two particles. These can become entangled upon scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we address this question with fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic description of a scattering setup and narrow initial momentum dispersion, we find the entanglement to scale linearly with the scattering cross section, including strong enhancement close to shape resonances. We discuss how the generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results open the way to probing and eventually using entanglement in quantum collisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Ding, Shoumik Chowdhury, Agustin Di Paolo, Réouven Assouly, Alan V. Oppenheim, Jeffrey A. Grover, William D. Oliver</p>
            <p>Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits, converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.</p>

            <p>Induced-coherence interferometry, first introduced in the Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) setup, enables retrieval of object information from the interference pattern of light that never interacted with the object. This scheme relies on two identically correlated photon pairs and the absence of "which-way" information about the photons illuminating the object to induce coherence in their companions. In previous studies, the effect of thermal background on the ZWM interferometer was considered; here we explicitly include background noise and analyze the interference visibility in both low- and high-gain regimes, revealing how thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that lowers the observed interference contrast. We show that the visibility can be restored either by optimal attenuation or by extending the geometry to a three-SPDC configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing heralded detection removes the detrimental effect of thermal background noise, restoring high-contrast interference fringes.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments. The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\sim1$~nm precision. Our results establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum properties of superpositions of oppositely squeezed states, which can be regarded as Schrodinger cat states. Compared with conventional coherent-state cat states, these states exhibit distinct photon-number structures and enhanced nonclassical features. We analyze their Wigner function and quantify the entanglement generated when they are injected into a 50:50 beam splitter. For small squeezing parameters, the resulting two-mode states possess higher entanglement than pure two-mode squeezed vacuum states. We also propose a linear-optical heralding scheme that approximates this superposition of oppositely squeezed states without requiring strong Kerr nonlinearities. Our results indicate that such states are promising resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing, particularly in regimes where high non-Gaussianity and strong entanglement are desirable.</p>

            <p>In this manuscript, we analyze the mechanism of the superradiant phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model under the classical oscillator limit using the pattern picture. By expanding the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian in operator space, we obtained three patterns, and we find that the phase transition arises from the competition between patterns. The difficulty in achieving the classical oscillator limit motivates our investigation into the quantum phase transition within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model. This parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model can reproduce the dynamics of a ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model in a squeezed-light frame. According to the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the normal and superradiant phases of this equivalent anisotropic Rabi model, we find that the excitation energy of the normal phase and the superradiant phase vanishes at the critical point. The photon number becomes infinite beyond the critical point. These results indicate that the system undergoes a superradiant phase transition at the critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsh Sharma, Sampriti Saha, A. S. Majumdar, Manik Banik, Himadri Shekhar Dhar</p>
            <p>Quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum many-body systems and hybrid quantum computing architectures is a fundamental yet challenging task. In recent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work from an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures that are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be restrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong collective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum simulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by evaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of interactions or by measuring suitable local observables only. We show that this formalism allows us to correctly estimate genuine multipartite entanglement in both stationary and time-evolved states of systems with strong interactions, including parametrized quantum states simulated on a quantum circuit with varying circuit depth and noise. We demonstrate its applicability to realistic physical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model, and the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Achieving strong coupling between excitons of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPs) is critical for advanced room-temperature quantum emitter and sensing applications. A key challenge is to have precise control of the emitters position with respect to an individual plasmonic nanostructure. Here, we present room temperature strong coupling between QDs and a single gold nano-bipyramid (BPs). The selection of the bipyramid plasmonic nanocavity offers access to a single hotspot with a very small mode volume. The localization of QDs at a single hotspot is achieved via plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization. This technique exploits the enhanced electric field at the BP tip to selectively polymerize a photosensitive QD-containing formulation. Room-temperature scattering spectra of a 3-QD-BP system reveal Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength of 175.68 meV. The with distinct anti-crossing behavior is confirmed by simulations. This approach simplifies QD integration for strong coupling systems compared to previous methods. These results indicate a scalable platform for solid-state quantum technologies with colloidal QDs, enabling explora-tion of exciton-plasmon interactions and further advance-ment of applications in quantum optics and quantum sensing under ambient conditions.</p>

            <p>Chiral discrimination of enantiomeric biomolecules is vital in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical chiral probes remain fundamentally bounded by the shot-noise limit due to quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate-photon-flux, high-sensitivity, quantum-noise-squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5 dB improvement beyond the SNL in distinguishing L- and D-amino acids in liquid phase. This non-destructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research, environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis.</p>

We here exactly solve a quantum first-passage time problem for quantum diffusion driven by measurement noise, a generalization of classical Brownian motion. Such continuous monitoring may trap the measured quantum system in a decoherence-free subspace, a fraction of the available state space that is isolated from the surroundings, and thus plays an important role in quantum information science. We analytically determine the first-passage time distribution, whose form neither depends on the system Hamiltonian nor on the measurement operator, and is therefore universal. These results provide a general framework to investigate the first-passage statistics of diffusive quantum trajectories.</p>

            <p>Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunwoo Choi, Jisang Seo, Weng C. Chew, Dong-Yeop Na</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics, thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.</p>

Similarly to him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In contrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to suppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian, non-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of light form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Tan, Zhanning Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</p>

The classical resource is fragile, decaying linearly with misalignment, whereas the quantum resource is robust, decaying only quadratically. Thus, the degree of nonlocality maps not to the maximum energetic value of a correlation, but to its operational robustness as a thermodynamic fuel.</p>

            <p>Cryptography depends on truly unpredictable numbers, but physical sources emit biased or correlated bits. Quantum mechanics enables the amplification of imperfect randomness into nearly perfect randomness, but prior demonstrations have required physically co-located, loophole-free Bell tests, constraining the feasibility of remote operation. Here we realize certified randomness amplification across a network by dynamically probing large, entangled quantum states on Quantinuum's 98-qubit Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Our protocol is secure even if the remote device acts maliciously or is compromised by an intercepting adversary, provided the samples are generated quickly enough to preclude classical simulation of the quantum circuits. We stream quantum gates in real time to the quantum processor, maintain quantum state coherence for $\approx 0.9$ seconds, and then reveal the measurement bases to the quantum processor only milliseconds before measurement. This limits the time for classical spoofing to 30 ms and constrains the location of hypothetical adversaries to a $4{,}500$ km radius. We achieve a fidelity of 0.586 on random circuits with 64 qubits and 276 two-qubit gates, enabling the amplification of realistic imperfect randomness with a low entropy rate into nearly perfect randomness.</p>

            <h2>Frequency shifts as a reflection of ground state squeezing and entanglement in two coupled harmonic oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Safoura Mirkhalaf, Helmut Ritsch, Karol Gietka</p>
            <p>It is often argued that two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems act as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement at zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts and squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one description manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can serve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency measurements. Furthermore, we show that this underlying squeezing, although not directly measurable, can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring squeezed quantum noise. Our results uncover a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh insight into how signatures of quantumness persist across the quantum-to-classical boundary.</p>

            <p>Large classical datasets are often processed in the streaming model, with data arriving one item at a time. In this model, quantum algorithms have been shown to offer an unconditional exponential advantage in space. However, experimentally implementing such streaming algorithms requires qubits that remain coherent while interacting with an external data stream. In this work, we realize such a data-streaming model using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum computer with long-lived qubits that communicate with an external server. We implement a quantum pair sketch, which is the primitive underlying many quantum streaming algorithms, and use it to solve Hidden Matching, a problem known to exhibit a theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space. Furthermore, we compile the quantum streaming algorithm to fault-tolerant quantum architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes and show that the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of fault-tolerance.</p>

            <p>The individual optimization of quantum circuit parameters is currently one of the main practical bottlenecks in variational quantum eigensolvers for electronic systems. To this end, several machine learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the problem. However, such method predominantly aims at training and predicting parameters tailored to individual molecules: either a specific structure, or several structures of the same molecule with varying bond lengths. This work explores machine learning based modeling strategies to include transferability between different molecules. We use a well investigated quantum circuit design and apply it to model properties of hydrogenic systems where we show parameter prediction that is systematically transferable to instances significantly larger than the training instances.</p>

            <p>We derive universal, experiment ready analytic laws for the breathing (monopole) mode of harmonically trapped Fermi gases. Within a fixed hyperangular channel $s>0$, contact-weighted products of associated Laguerre polynomials reduce to an elementary gamma ratio, yielding: (i) a level resolved fractional breathing mode shift with scaling $\delta\omega/(2\omega)\propto Q^{-1}$, where $Q\equiv 2q+s+1$, with $q$ the radial quantum number; (ii) a first order quantum anomaly correction involving exactly two intermediate states, producing a $Q^{-2}$ falloff of the leaked monopole strength with an explicit prefactor; and (iii) a closed form finite temperature average exhibiting a low-$T$ plateau and a $1/T$ high-$T$ tail. We also obtain a mixed anomaly\nobreakdash-quartic correction for weak anharmonicity. All expressions become parameter free after a single per-channel calibration of the Tan contact $\lambda_s$ at $q=0$.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Ferenczi, Sutapa Samanta, Dagen Wang, Todd Hodges</p>
            <p>Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning (ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs), thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii) adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10 dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.</p>

            <p>The quantum error correction threshold is closely related to the Nishimori physics of random statistical models. We extend quantum information measures such as coherent information beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as sharp indicators of phase transitions. We derive exact inequalities for several generalized measures, demonstrating that each attains its extremum along the Nishimori line. Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these quantities in the 2d $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects. We further analyze the domain-wall free energy distribution and confirm its scale invariance at the multicritical point.</p>

We show, in analogy to global existence results for first order ODEs, that global existence and uniqueness still hold true if the local terms grow at most linearly in space. Moreover, we obtain Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential light cones for the generated dynamics. For the proof, we mainly assume Lieb-Robinson bounds with linear light cones for dynamics generated by uniformly bounded local terms. These are known to hold for example if the local terms are exponentially localized.</p>

            <p>We introduce a focal-plane detector for advancing the energy and angular resolutions of current X-ray telescopes. The architecture integrates a metallic magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\mu$m absorber length used with a 12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of ~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum technologies, but their performance is limited by decoherence arising from diverse mechanisms. The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to $T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times. These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits for scalable quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate the mean-field scattering dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensate interacting with a Rosen--Morse potential. For specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact, degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect transmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the stability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only one solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.</p>

            <p>Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <p>We derive a repulsive, charge-dipole-like interaction for a Dirac particle in a rotating frame, arising from a geometric $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated with the Berry phase. The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\vert r\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction.</p>

In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of the magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out divergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of generators, which signal either the breakdown of the Néel-ordered phase or the presence of significant magnon decay.</p>

It requires only primitive S-subshell Gaussian-type orbitals and uses two parameters to characterize all exponent coefficients. In the case of the diatomic hydrogen molecule, the basis set generated by this formalism produces a dissociation curve more consistent with cc-pV5Z than cc-pVTZ at the size of aug-cc-pVDZ. Finally, we test our even-tempered formalism against several types of tetra-atomic hydrogen molecules for ground-state computation and point out its current limitations and potential improvements.</p>

            <p>The use of macroscopic coherent quantum states at room temperature is crucial in modern quantum technologies. In light of recent experiments demonstrating high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this work we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning exciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton interacting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well as with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear equations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's coefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which translates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the form of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear stability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question, which allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly important for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the considered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific case of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton interacts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable, provided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity value defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore, interactions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of modulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations. We also numerically solve the 2D nonlocal NLS equation in the polar coordinates and obtain its fundamental soliton solution, which is stable.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a method for super-resolving signals encoded as finite mixtures of bosonic modes using collective measurements that exploit permutation symmetry. Specifically, we use multiple copies of the state $\rho$ of the finite mixture to extract an estimate for the purity of $\rho$ via a spectrum measurement, the weak Schur-sampling measurement. Depending on the outcome we then further fine-grain the measurement to optimally extract an estimate of the relative intensity between the two incoherent mixtures. Our protocol furnishes simultaneous estimates for both the relative intensity and the separation of incoherent signals saturating the multi-parameter Cramér-Rao bound, and is robust against misalignment errors. We also provide viable experimental avenues for implementing such collective measurements in different set-ups.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional entanglement provides unique ways of transcending the limitations of current approaches in quantum information processing, quantum communications based on qubits. The generation of time-frequency qudit states offer significantly increased quantum capacities while keeping the number of photons constant, but pose significant challenges regarding the possible measurements for certification of entanglement. Here, we develop a new scheme and experimentally demonstrate the certification of 24-dimensional entanglement and a 9-dimensional quantum steering. We then subject our photon-pairs to dispersion conditions equivalent to the transmission through 600-km of fiber and still certify 21-dimensional entanglement. Furthermore, we use a steering inequality to prove 7-dimensional entanglement in a semi-device independent manner, proving that large chromatic dispersion is not an obstacle in distributing and certifying high-dimensional entanglement and quantum steering. Our approach, leveraging intrinsic large-alphabet nature of telecom-band photons, enables scalable, commercially viable, and field-deployable entangled and steerable quantum sources, providing a pathway towards fully scalable quantum information processer and high-dimensional quantum communication networks.</p>

            <p>Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology, especially in quantum interferometry. A full phase estimation scheme usually includes the optimal probe state and measurement. For the finite-dimensional states in Fock basis, the N00N state ceases to be optimal when the average particle number is fixed yet not equal to the Fock dimension (Fock number of the highest occupied Fock state of one mode), and what is the true optimal finite-dimensional probe state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal finite-dimensional probe states reveal an important fact that the Fock dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</p>

In this work, we systematically study such a family of multi-qubit gates implementable over an array of quantum dots by DC evolution. A useful representation of the computational Hamiltonian is proposed for a dot-array with strong spin-orbit coupling effects, distinctive $g$-factor tensors and varying interdot couplings. Adopting a perturbative treatment, we model a multi-qubit DC gate by the first-order dynamics in the qubit frame and develop a detailed formalism for decomposing the resulting gate, estimating and optimizing the coherent gate errors with appropriate local phase shifts for arbitrary array connectivity. Examples of such multi-qubit gates and their applications in quantum error correction and quantum algorithms are also explored, demonstrating their potential advantage in accelerating complex tasks and reducing overall errors.</p>

            <p>Hybrid languages like the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) are essential for programming systems that mix quantum and conventional computing models, while execution of these programs is often deferred to a system-specific implementation. Here, we develop the QIR Execution Engine (QIR-EE) for parsing, interpreting, and executing QIR across multiple hardware platforms. QIR-EE uses LLVM to execute hybrid instructions specifying quantum programs and, by design, presents extension points that support customized runtime and hardware environments. We demonstrate an implementation that uses the XACC quantum hardware-accelerator library to dispatch prototypical quantum programs on different commercial quantum platforms and numerical simulators, and we validate execution of QIR-EE on IonQ, Quantinuum, and IBM hardware. Our results highlight the efficiency of hybrid executable architectures for handling mixed instructions, managing mixed data, and integrating with quantum computing frameworks to realize cross-platform execution.</p>

            <h2>Contraction of Private Quantum Channels and Private Quantum Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. With the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight, while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.</p>

            <p>Finding molecular ground states and energies with variational quantum eigensolvers is central to chemistry applications on quantum computers. Physically motivated ansätze based on excitation operators respect physical symmetries, but existing quantum-aware optimizers, such as Rotosolve, have been limited to simpler operator types. To fill this gap, we introduce ExcitationSolve, a fast quantum-aware optimizer that is globally-informed, gradient-free, and hyperparameter-free. ExcitationSolve extends these optimizers to parameterized unitaries with generators $G$ of the form $G^3=G$ exhibited by excitation operators in approaches such as unitary coupled cluster. ExcitationSolve determines the global optimum along each variational parameter using the same quantum resources that gradient-based optimizers require for one update step. We provide optimization strategies for both fixed and adaptive variational ansätze, along with generalizations for simultaneously selecting and optimizing multiple excitations. On molecular ground state energy benchmarks, ExcitationSolve outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by converging faster, achieving chemical accuracy for equilibrium geometries in a single parameter sweep, yielding shallower adaptive ansätze and remaining robust to real hardware noise. By uniting physical insight with efficient optimization, ExcitationSolve paves the way for scalable quantum chemistry calculations.</p>

            <p>Whilst the complexity of acquiring knowledge of a quantum state has been extensively studied in the fields of quantum tomography and quantum learning, a physical understanding of its operational role and cost in quantum thermodynamics is lacking. Knowledge is central to thermodynamics, as exemplified by Maxwell's demon thought experiment, where a demonic agent is able to extract paradoxical amounts of work -- reconciled by the thermodynamic costs of acquiring this knowledge. In this work, we address this gap by extending unitary models of measurement to incorporate the resources available to an agent. We view an agent's knowledge of a quantum state as their ability to reconstruct it unitarily given access to states with partial knowledge of the true state. In our model, an agent correlates an unknown $d$-dimensional system, with copies of a $k$-dimensional probe ($k\leq d$), which are then used to unitarily reconstruct an estimate state in $d$-dimensional memories. We find that this framework is a unitary representation of coarse-grained POVMs. As an application, we investigate the role of knowledge in an extended Szilard Engine scenario.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Sedlák, Robert Stárek, Nikola Horová, Michal Mičuda, Jaromir Fiurášek, Alessandro Bisio</p>
            <p>We address the fundamental task of converting $n$ uses of an unknown unitary transformation into a quantum state (i.e., storage) and later retrieval of the transformation. Specifically, we consider the case where the unknown unitary is selected with equal prior probability from two options. First, we prove that the optimal storage strategy involves the sequential application of the $n$ uses of the unknown unitary, and it produces the optimal state for discrimination between the two possible unitaries. Next, we show that incoherent "measure-and-prepare" retrieval achieves the maximum fidelity between the retrieved operation and the original (qubit) unitary. We then identify the retrieval strategy that maximizes the probability of successfully and perfectly retrieving the unknown transformation. In the regime in which the fidelity between the two possible unitaries is large the probability of success scales as $ P_{succ} = 1 - \mathcal{O}(n^{-2} ) $, which is a quadratic improvement with respect to the case in which the unitaries are drawn from the entire unitary group $U(d)$ with uniform prior probability. Finally, we present an optical experiment for this approach and assess the storage and retrieval quality using quantum tomography of states and processes. The results are discussed in relation to non-optimal measure-and-prepare strategy, highlighting the advantages of our protocol.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungeng Zhou, Jiahao Huang, Jinye Wei, Chengyin Han, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>Entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors encounter a fundamental trade-off: while entanglement improves precision to the Heisenberg limit, it restricts dynamic range. To address this trade-off, we present a credible-interval-based adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state-based atomic clocks. Our method optimally integrates prior knowledge with new measurements and determines the interrogation time by correlating it with the period of the likelihood function, based on Bayesian credible intervals. Our protocol can be implemented using either individual or cascaded GHZ states, thereby extending the dynamic range without compromising Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. In parallel with the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol using fixed interrogation times, the dynamic range can be extended through an interferometry sequence that employs individual GHZ states with variable interrogation times. Furthermore, by varying the interrogation times, the dynamic range of the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol can be further extended. Crucially, our protocol enables dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling $\propto 1/(Nt)$ in both particle number $N$ and total interrogation time $t$, surpassing the hybrid scaling $\propto 1/{(N\sqrt {t}})$ of the conventional cascaded-GHZ-state protocol. While offering a wider dynamic range, the protocol is more stable against noise and more robust to dephasing than existing adaptive schemes. Beyond atomic clocks, our approach establishes a general framework for developing entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors that simultaneously achieve both high precision and broad dynamic range.</p>

            <p>The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behavior of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce color-neutrality constraints. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum state tomography, the task of learning an unknown quantum state, is a fundamental problem in quantum information. In standard settings, the complexity of this problem depends significantly on the type of quantum state that one is trying to learn, with pure states being substantially easier to learn than general mixed states. A natural question is whether this separation holds for any quantum state learning setting. In this work, we consider the online learning framework and prove the surprising result that learning pure states in this setting is as hard as learning mixed states. More specifically, we show that both classes share almost the same sequential fat-shattering dimension, leading to identical regret scaling. We also generalize previous results on full quantum state tomography in the online setting to (i) the $\epsilon$-realizable setting and (ii) learning the density matrix only partially, using smoothed analysis.</p>

            <p>In 2024, Kliuchnikov and Schönnenbeck showed a connection between the Barnes Wall lattices, stabilizer states and Clifford operations. In this work, we study their results and relate them to the problem of lower bounding stabilizer ranks. We show the first quantitative lower bound on stabilizer fidelity as a function of stabilizer ranks, which reproduces the linear-by-log lower bound for $\chi_{\delta}({|{H}\rangle^{ \otimes n}})$, i.e, on the approximate stabilizer rank of $|H\rangle^{\otimes n}$. In fact, we show that the lower bound holds even when the fidelity between the approximation and ${|H\rangle}^{\otimes n}$ is exponentially small, which is currently the best lower bound in this regime. Next, we define a new magic monotone for pure states, the Barnes Wall norm, and its corresponding approximate variant. We upper bound these monotones by the $CS$-count of state preparation, and also by the stabilizer ranks. In particular, the upper bound given by the $CS$-count is tight, in the sense that we exhibit states that achieve the bound. Apart from these results, we give a Fidelity Amplification algorithm, which provides a trade-off between approximation error and the stabilizer rank. As a corollary, it gives us a way to compose approximate stabilizer decompositions into approximate decompositions of their tensor products. Finally, we provide an alternate, elementary proof of the existence and density of product states with maximal stabilizer ranks, which was first proven by Lovitz and Steffan (2022), where they used results from algebraic geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andy Chia, Wai-Keong Mok, Leong-Chuan Kwek, Changsuk Noh</p>
            <p>Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schrödinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Liénard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</p>

            <p>Neutral atom arrays provide a versatile platform to implement coherent quantum annealing as an approach to solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. Here we present and experimentally demonstrate an efficient encoding scheme based on chains of Rydberg-blockaded atoms, which we call quantum wires, to natively embed maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems on a neutral atom architecture. For graphs with quasi-unit-disk connectivity, in which only a few long-range edges are required, our approach requires a significantly lower overhead in the number of ancilla qubits than previous proposals, facilitating the implementation on currently available hardware. To demonstrate the approach, we perform weighted-graph annealing on a programmable atom array using local light shifts to encode problem-specific weights across graphs of varying sizes. This approach successfully identifies the solutions to the original MWIS and QUBO graph instances. Our work expands the operational toolkit of near-term neutral atom arrays, enhancing their potential for scalable quantum optimization.</p>

            <p>We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.</p>

            <p>Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distributions. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature fails to accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically more accurate at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</p>

            <p>Collision models (CMs) describe an open system interacting in sequence with elements of an environment, termed ancillas. They have been established as a useful tool for analyzing non-Markovian open quantum dynamics based on the ability to control the environmental memory through simple feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how ancilla-ancilla entanglement can serve as a mechanism for controlling the non-Markovianity of an open system, focusing on an operational approach to generating correlations within the environment. To this end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially generated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a composite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an enlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and show that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of ancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand, when system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find the open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain qualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the onset of system non-Markovianity.</p>

Our approach efficiently constructs block-encodings of (persistent) Laplacians, enabling estimation via stochastic rank methods with complexity polylogarithmic in the number of simplices across both sparse and dense regimes. Unlike prior spectral algorithms that suffer when Betti numbers are small, we introduce homology tracking and property testing techniques achieving exponential speedups under natural sparsity and structure assumptions. We also formulate homology triviality and equivalence testing as property testing problems, giving nearly linear-time quantum algorithms when the boundary rank is large. A cohomological formulation further yields rank-independent testing and polylog-time manipulation of $r$-cocycles via block-encoded projections. These results open a new direction in quantum topological data analysis and demonstrate provable quantum advantages in computing topological invariants.</p>

Here, we demonstrate an optical QRC platform based on deterministically generated multimode squeezed states, exploiting both spectral and temporal multiplexing in a fully continuous-variable (CV) setting, and enabling controlled fading memory. Data is encoded via programmable phase shaping of the pump in an optical parametric process and retrieved through mode-selective homodyne detection. Real-time memory is achieved through feedback using electro-optic phase modulation, while long-term dependencies are achieved via spatial multiplexing. This architecture with minimal post-processing performs nonlinear temporal tasks, including parity checking and chaotic signal forecasting, with results corroborated by a high-fidelity Digital Twin. We show that leveraging the entangled multimode structure significantly enhances the expressivity and memory capacity of the quantum reservoir.

            <p>Modular quantum architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling quantum computing systems by connecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). However, this approach introduces significant challenges due to costly inter-core operations between chips and quantum state transfers, which contribute to noise and quantum decoherence. This paper presents QARMA, a novel Qubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for Modular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that incorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an attention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal qubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core communications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based encoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit interactions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages mid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and qubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular architecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to 100% (on average 86%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger circuits without reuse. Against traditional modular qubit mapping, our approach achieves 97-100% reduction in inter-core operation. The proposed methods advance quantum circuit compilation techniques and enable the execution of more extensive quantum algorithms on resource-constrained modular quantum systems, contributing to the growing body of research on scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

We propose VQC-MLPNet, a hybrid architecture where a VQC generates the first-layer weights of a classical multilayer perceptron during training, while inference is performed entirely classically. This design preserves scalability, reduces quantum resource demands, and enables practical deployment. We provide a theoretical analysis based on statistical learning and neural tangent kernel theory, establishing explicit risk bounds and demonstrating improved expressivity and trainability compared to purely quantum or existing hybrid approaches. These theoretical insights demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum architectures. Empirical results on diverse datasets, including quantum-dot classification and genomic sequence analysis, show that VQC-MLPNet achieves high accuracy and robustness under realistic noise models, outperforming classical and quantum baselines while using significantly fewer trainable parameters.</p>

However, despite the improvements to existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known about \textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if state preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous resource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the most general case whereby the dynamics are not \textit{fast-forwardable}, these findings provide a 100-200x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis contributes towards establishing more promising applications for quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Perfect quantum state transfer through a chaotic spin chain via many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane Dooley, Luke Johnston, Patrick Gormley, Beth Campbell</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.</p>

            <h2>Neural Importance Resampling: A Practical Sampling Strategy for Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eimantas Ledinauskas, Egidijus Anisimovas</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising and $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg models show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with state of the art methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Qi, Chao-Han Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to the presence of barren plateaus and its sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</p>

            <h2>Towards quantum topological data analysis: torsion detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nhat A. Nghiem</p>
            <p>Topological data analysis (TDA) has become an attractive area for the application of quantum computing. Recent advances have uncovered many interesting connections between the two fields. On one hand, complexity theoretic results show that estimating Betti numbers, a central task in TDA, is NP hard, indicating that a generic quantum speedup is unlikely. On the other hand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings and demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups under certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti numbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity and holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of topological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of homology that can reveal richer structural information. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for torsion detection, that is, determining whether a given simplicial complex contains torsion. Our algorithm, assisted by a low complexity classical procedure, can succeed with high probability and potentially offer exponential speedup over the classical counterpart.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has made remarkable strides in recent years, as demonstrated by quantum supremacy experiments and the realization of high-fidelity, fault-tolerant gates. However, a major obstacle persists: practical real-world applications remain scarce, largely due to the inefficiency of loading classical data into quantum processors. Here, we propose an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from classical data encoding to directly processing quantum data. We target quantum metrology, a practical quantum technology whose precision is often constrained by realistic noise. We develop an experimentally feasible scheme in which a quantum computer optimizes information acquired from quantum metrology, thereby enhancing performance in noisy quantum metrology tasks and overcoming the classical-data-loading bottleneck. We demonstrate this approach through experimental implementation with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and numerical simulations using models of distributed superconducting quantum processors. Our results show that this method improves the accuracy of sensing estimates and significantly boosts sensitivity, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, thus offering a new pathway to harness near-term quantum computers for realistic quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>A Deficiency-Based Framework for the Operational Interpretation of Quantum Resources with Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunho Kim, Chunhe Xiong, Junde Wu</p>
            <p>A fundamental challenge in quantum resource theory lies in establishing operational interpretations by quantifying the distinct advantages that quantum resources provide over classical resources in specific physical tasks. However, conventional quantum resource theories have inherent limitations in characterizing operational advantages for certain quantum tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that defines the resource deficiency of a given state relative to the set of maximal resource states in physical tasks. This extension not only broadens the scope of quantum resource theories and provides more comprehensive operational interpretations, but also delivers crucial insights for classifying and interpreting mixed resource states -- specifically those with inactive resource properties in certain tasks -- that have remained uncharacterized in conventional quantum resource theories. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the proposed geometric measure satisfies the framework's requirements for both quantum coherence and entanglement, while also demonstrating its ability to characterize the operational disadvantage of arbitrary states compared to maximal resource states in subchannel discrimination tasks under specific conditions.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study a hybrid quantum system composed of a quantum battery and a coherence-driven charger interacting with a Quantum Autonomous Thermal Machine (QATM). The QATM, made of two qubits, each coupled to Markovian bosonic thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, acts as a structured environment that mediates energy and coherence transfer between the charger and the battery. By applying a coherent driving field on the charger, we investigate the coherence injection effect on the dynamics, including non-Markovianity, power of charging, coherence storage, and ergotropy. We show that the QATM effectively filters the decoherence induced by the thermal baths and induces non-Markovian memory effects due to correlation backflow. Our results demonstrate that coherence driving enhances the battery's ergotropy; coherence driving raises the maximum ergotropy by approximately 40% compared to the case without coherence driving, and the power of charging by preserving the internal energy of the charger and facilitating coherent energy transfer.</p>

            <p>In our recent work (Sharoglazova et al., Nature 643, 67 (2025)), we reported the measurement of the speed of tunnelling particles using a coupled waveguide system. The measured speed was found to disagree with the standard guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics, which we regard as a challenge to that framework. In the present work, we provide a more detailed account of this issue. In particular, we argue that agreement or disagreement between standard quantum mechanics and Bohmian mechanics on quantities such as particle velocity, speed, tunnelling, and dwell times depends solely on the choice of guiding equation. If this choice is made based on observable spatio-temporal transformation behaviour of the particle density, the two theories agree on these phenomena.</p>

            <p>We study the generative quantum eigensolver (GQE)~\cite{nakaji2024generative}, which trains a classical generative model to produce quantum circuits with desired properties such as describing molecular ground states. We introduce two methods to improve GQE. First, we identify a limitation of direct preference optimization (DPO) when used as the loss function in GQE, and propose Persistent-DPO (P-DPO) as a solution to this limitation. Second, as a method to improve the online learning during the training phase of GQE, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines online and offline learning. Using a transformer decoder implementation of GQE, we evaluate our methods through ground state search experiments on the $\mathrm{BeH_2^{}}$ molecule and observe that P-DPO achieves lower energies than DPO. The hybrid approach further improves convergence and final energy values, particularly with P-DPO. A method for imposing upper constraints on the occurrences of specific gates is also presented, which serves to enhance the applicability of GQE.</p>

            <p>We study multiparty entanglement near measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), which arise in ensembles of local quantum circuits built with unitaries and measurements. In contrast to equilibrium quantum critical transitions, where entanglement is short-ranged, MIPTs possess long-range k-party genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) characterized by an infinite hierarchy of entanglement exponents for k>=2. First, we represent the average spread of entanglement with "entanglement clusters," and use them to conjecture general exponent relations: 1) classical dominance, 2) monotonicity, 3) subadditivity. We then introduce measure-weighted graphs to construct such clusters in general circuits. Second, we obtain the exact entanglement exponents for a 1d MIPT in a measurement-only circuit that maps to percolation by exploiting non-unitary conformal field theory. The exponents, which we numerically verify, obey the inequalities. We also extend the construction to a 2d MIPT that maps to classical 3d percolation, and numerically find the first entanglement exponents. Our results provide a firm ground to understand the multiparty entanglement of MIPTs, and more general ensembles of quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>We show that the quantum smooth label cover problem is undecidable and RE-hard. This sharply contrasts the quantum unique label cover problem, which can be decided efficiently by a result of Kempe, Regev, and Toner (FOCS'08). On the other hand, our result aligns with the RE-hardness of the quantum label cover problem, which follows from the celebrated MIP* = RE result of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen (ACM'21). Additionally, we show that the quantum oracularized smooth label cover problem is RE-hard. Our second result fits with the alternative quantum unique games conjecture recently proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25) on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label cover problem. Our proof techniques include a quantum version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5 (STOC'96) for BCSMIP*-protocols, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>We study the use of triorthogonal codes for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and propose two methods to circumvent the Eastin-Knill theorem, which prohibits any single quantum error-correcting code from supporting both universality and a transversal gate set. We show that our methods reduce the resource overhead compared with existing fault-tolerant protocols. We develop a simple fault-tolerant implementation of the logical Hadamard gate for triorthogonal codes by exploiting the fact that they have transversal controlled-Z (CZ) gates, resulting in a circuit with reduced overhead. We also introduce a procedure for generating a symmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane code paired with a triorthogonal code, which allows CNOT and CZ gate transversality across the pair of codes. In addition, we present logical state teleportation circuits that transfer encoded states between the two codes, allowing all logical operations to be performed transversally. Our methods can be integrated into the Steane error correction framework without incurring additional resource cost. Finally, using the 15-qubit code as an example, we demonstrate that our protocols significantly reduce the gate overhead compared with other existing methods. These results highlight the potential of combining distinct code structures to achieve low-overhead, universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

However, existing studies often struggle to achieve broad applicability, high performance, and efficient resource and memory utilization. To address these challenges, we provide HPQEA, a quantum emulator based on the state-vector emulation approach. HPQEA includes three main features: a high-performance computing core, an optimized controlled-NOT gate computation strategy, and effective utilization of high-bandwidth memory. Verification and evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error. It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution, supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources. Furthermore, it exceeds the Nvidia A100 in normalized gate speed for systems with up to 20 qubits.

            <p>Autonomous quantum machines (AQMs) execute tasks without requiring time-dependent external control. Motivations for AQMs include the restrictions imposed by classical control on quantum machines' coherence times and geometries. Most AQM work is theoretical and abstract; yet an experiment recently demonstrated AQMs' usefulness in qubit reset, crucial to quantum computing. To further reduce quantum computing's classical control, we propose realizations of (fully and partially) quantum-autonomous gates on three platforms: Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. First, we show that a Rydberg-blockade interaction or an ultrafast transition can quantum-autonomously effect entangling gates on Rydberg atoms. One can perform $Z$ or entangling gates on trapped ions mostly quantum-autonomously, by sculpting a linear Paul trap or leveraging a ring trap. Passive lasers control these gates, as well as the Rydberg-atom gates, quantum-autonomously. Finally, circuit quantum electrodynamics can enable quantum-autonomous $Z$ and $XY$ gates on superconducting qubits. The gates can serve as building blocks for (fully or partially) quantum-autonomous circuits, which may reduce classical-control burdens.</p>

Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor.

Our approach employs spatial grid partitioning to decompose the problem into manageable subgraphs, solves each subgraph using Analog Hamiltonian Simulation (AHS), and merges solutions greedily to approximate the global optimum. We evaluate the framework on a 50-asset portfolio optimization problem using historical S&P 500 data, benchmarking against classical simulated annealing. Results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the scalability and practical potential of our method in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

            <p>Quantum computation with $d$-level quantum systems, also known as qudits, benefits from the possibility to use a richer computational space compared to qubits. However, for arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform the issue is that a generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native operations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels in a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each other due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a significant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may introduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to decompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses is at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific operations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses. We provide a comparison of qudit decompositions for several types of trapped ions, specifically $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$, $^{137}\text{Ba}^+$ and $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ with different selection rules, and also decomposition for superconducting qudits.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a promising route toward scalable quantum computation, where entanglement-assisted LOCC and circuit knitting represent two complementary approaches. The former deterministically realizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources, whereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential sampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these two paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of entanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical communication. Furthermore, we extend the entanglement-assisted circuit knitting framework to the black-box setting, which can be applicable to the circuit knitting of quantum combs. This hybrid approach can be viewed as a form of hybrid classical-quantum computation, balancing the trade-off between sampling and entanglement efficiency, and enabling more resource-practical implementations of distributed quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</p>

            <h2>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matjaž Kebrič, Ulrich Schollwöck, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</p>

            <h2>Quantised helicity in optical media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neel Mackinnon, Jörg B. Götte, Stephen M. Barnett, Niclas Westerberg</p>
            <p>We present a new approach to the definition of optical helicity in a medium. Our approach resolves the problem that duality transformations which simultaneously combine $\mathbf{E}$ with $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ with $\mathbf{B}$ are incompatible with linear constitutive relations. We find that the helicity density in a medium, as the conserved quantity associated with duality transforms, must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and that it can be expressed naturally in terms of the elementary polarised excitations of the system. In media for which the helicity is conserved, each circular excitation carries a well-defined helicity. However, in a medium for which the helicity is not conserved, we find that the time-varying helicity can be viewed in terms of oscillations between different helicity eigenstates, analogous to neutrino oscillations. Here we explicitly study the helicity in homogeneous and lossless media but we believe that, differently to other choices, this helicity is readily generalisable to media that may be inhomogeneous, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal.</p>

            <h2>Direct and mediated dipole-dipole interactions in a reconfigurable array of optical traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mian Wu, Nan Li, Han Cai, Cheng Liu, Huizhu Hu</p>
            <p>Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum experience both electrostatic and light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, offering a versatile platform to explore mesoscopic entanglement and many-body dynamics. A significant challenge in optical trap arrays is to achieve site-resolved, point-to-point tunability: adjusting the laser parameters of a single trap typically induces global cross-talk to neighboring sites, hindering independent control. Inspired by tunable couplers in superconducting circuits, we implement an ancillary nanoparticle that functions as a coupler between two target nanoparticles. Within a reconfigurable three-particle array, we demonstrate broad tunability of the direct dipole-dipole interaction by controlling the phase and position of the traps. In addition, we observe spectral signatures consistent with mediated interactions between the target particles via the ancillary one, manifested as mode participation beyond the uncoupled response. Our results establish a practical route to tailored, site-resolved control in multi-particle optical trap arrays, expanding the optical-binding toolbox and opening opportunities for programmable oscillator networks relevant to macroscopic quantum mechanics and precision sensing.</p>

            <h2>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini</p>
            <p>Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</p>

            <h2>Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn</p>
            <p>We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</p>

            <p>We present GSCDB137, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 137 data sets (8377 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and barrier heights, (intramolecular) non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spin-contaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density functional approximations (DFAs) confirms the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall but also reveals notable exceptions: functional performance for frequencies and electric-field properties correlates poorly with that for other ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the meta-GGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment.

            <h2>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guglielmo Grimaldi, Matthew Headrick, Veronika E. Hubeny</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</p>

            <p>This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies. The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors. Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.</p>

We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases.

            <p>Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</p>

We introduce a simple and versatile method for creating and certifying entanglement and many-body Bell correlations. This method relies on a single qubit interacting with an $N$-qubit system. We demonstrate that: (i) such pairwise interaction is sufficient to induce many-body quantum correlations, and (ii) the qubit can serve as a probe to extract all information about these correlations. Thus, single-qubit measurements reveal multi-partite entanglement and $N$-body Bell correlations, enabling the rapid and efficient certification of non-classicality in complex systems.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuumś Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

Recent work analyzed stationary properties of multichannel Dicke superradiance using hydrodynamic mean-field approximations as shown by Mok et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L022015 (2025)]. We extend this with a symbolic quantum-trajectory method, providing a simple route to analytic solutions. For two channels, the behavior of the stationary ground-state distribution resembles a first-order phase transition at the point where the channel-rate ratio is equal to unity. For $d$ competing channels, we obtain scaling laws for the superradiant peak time and intensity. These results unify and extend single-channel Dicke dynamics to multilevel emitters and provide a compact tool for cavity and waveguide experiments, where permutation-symmetric reservoirs engineer multiple collective decay paths.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic structures are an excellent platform for controllable single-photon scattering. The tunable light-matter interaction enables the construction of a single-photon switch -- a device that can route a single photon from an input port to a selected output port. Such single-photon switching devices can be integrated into reconfigurable photonic circuits to actively control the photon propagation direction in a quantum network. Ideally, a single-photon switch should be fast, efficient, scalable, compatible with existing technology, and should preserve the routed photon states with high fidelity. In this review, we focus on theoretical proposals and experimental demonstrations of single-photon switches based on quantum emitters coupled to solid-state nanostructures, including waveguide and cavity architectures. We also present the theoretical methods that are commonly used to model single-photon scattering in waveguide-based systems by applying them to the elementary system of a two-level emitter coupled to a waveguide. This review brings together key theoretical techniques from quantum optics, their applications to controllable single-photon transport, and the experimental realization of single-photon switching devices across different physical platforms, including semiconductor quantum dots, neutral atoms, superconducting qubits, and color centers.</p>

            <p>Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling. Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx 2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about $0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models, while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative to full multidimensional quantum treatments.</p>

At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.</p>

            <h2>Federated Quantum Kernel Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Time-Series</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Chen-Yu Liu, Kin K. Leung</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap, we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed, privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.</p>

            <p>When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioan Bâldea</p>
            <p>Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum relaxation dynamics for a lattice version of the one-dimensional (1D) $N$-flavor Gross-Neveu (GN) model after a Hamiltonian parameter quench. Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\gamma$, we numerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent self-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\gamma=0$) finite-size system subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter dynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our results imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However, time-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if $\gamma>0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the post-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Ghosh, Patrick Brosseau, Dmitry N. Dirin, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Patanjali Kambhampati</p>
            <p>Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.</p>

            <p>We give a pair of algorithms that efficiently learn a quantum state prepared by Clifford gates and $O(\log n)$ non-Clifford gates. Specifically, for an $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ prepared with at most $t$ non-Clifford gates, our algorithms use $\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$ time and copies of $|\psi\rangle$ to learn $|\psi\rangle$ to trace distance at most $\varepsilon$. The first algorithm for this task is more efficient, but requires entangled measurements across two copies of $|\psi\rangle$. The second algorithm uses only single-copy measurements at the cost of polynomial factors in runtime and sample complexity. Our algorithms more generally learn any state with sufficiently large stabilizer dimension, where a quantum state has stabilizer dimension $k$ if it is stabilized by an abelian group of $2^k$ Pauli operators. We also develop an efficient property testing algorithm for stabilizer dimension, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>In this work we explore how different types of resources are distributed among the states generated by quantum random circuits (QRC). We focus on multipartite non-locality, but we also analyze quantum correlations by appealing to different entanglement and non-classicality measures. We analyze the violation of Mermin and Svetlichny inequalities in order to get a glance at the distribution of nonlocality and genuine multipartite nonlocality. Next, we compare universal vs non-universal sets of gates, to gain insight into the problem of explaining quantum advantage. By comparing the results obtained with ideal (noiseless) vs noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we lay the basis of a certification protocol, which aims to quantify how robust is the resources distribution among the states that a given device can generate. We have implemented our non-locality-based benchmark on actual quantum processors with different architectures, in order to assess up to which point they are capable of reproducing the ideal results.</p>

            <p>We analyze the existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points in simple bosonic systems - comprising up to six modes with damping and/or amplification - under two complementary scenarios to those described in arXiv:2405.01666: (i) nonconventional PT-symmetric dynamics confined to a subspace of the full Liouville space, and (ii) systems featuring unidirectional coupling.} The system dynamics described by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is governed by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points with up to sixth-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed, though relevant only for short-time dynamics. This raises the question of whether higher-order inherited singularities exist in bosonic systems under general conditions. Nevertheless, for short times, unidirectional coupling of various types enables the concatenation of simple bosonic systems with second- and third-order exceptional degeneracies such that arbitrarily high exceptional degeneracies are reached. Methods for numerical identifying the quantum exceptional and hybrid points together with their degeneracies are addressed. Following arXiv:2405.01666 rich dynamics of second-order field-operator moments is analyzed from the point of view of the presence of exceptional and diabolical points and their degeneracies.</p>

            <p>WiFi-based indoor localization is essential for asset tracking, healthcare monitoring, and smart buildings. However, existing systems face challenges such as data variability, environmental noise, and difficulty detecting floor and building levels, compounded by limited labeled data and high received signal strength (RSS) collection costs. This paper introduces quantum stochastic contrast learning (QSCL), a novel framework grounded in rigorous theoretical foundations. We present four theorems and one lemma that establish the probabilistic augmentation, diversity enhancement, relationship preservation, and resilience of QSCL under quantum noise, supported by formal proofs. Leveraging these foundations, QSCL utilizes quantum computing (QC) to generate strong data augmentations with stochastic perturbations, enhancing data diversity, while classical weak augmentations provide subtle variations for robust feature learning. We propose a spatial temporal adaptive attention (STAA) encoder that integrates convolutional layers with adaptive attention mechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data. Furthermore, a bidirectional contrastive loss function is introduced to capture forward and reverse relationships between augmented views, ensuring robust representations. Comprehensive evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc datasets validate QSCL, demonstrating superior performance with reduced labeled data and resilience to quantum noise such as bit-flip, dephasing, and measurement noise. The proposed framework significantly improves localization accuracy, floor and building detection, and generalizability in challenging indoor environments.</p>

            <p>A diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) is a generative model renowned for its ability to produce high-quality outputs in tasks such as image and audio generation. However, training DPMs on large, high-dimensional datasets such as high-resolution images or audio incurs significant computational, energy, and hardware costs. In this work, we introduce efficient quantum algorithms for implementing DPMs through various quantum ODE solvers. These algorithms highlight the potential of quantum Carleman linearization for diverse mathematical structures, leveraging state-of-the-art quantum linear system solvers (QLSS) or linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (LCHS). Specifically, we focus on two approaches: DPM-solver-$k$ which employs exact $k$-th order derivatives to compute a polynomial approximation of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$; and UniPC which uses finite difference of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$ at different points $(x_{s_m}, \lambda_{s_m})$ to approximate higher-order derivatives. As such, this work represents one of the most direct and pragmatic applications of quantum algorithms to large-scale machine learning models, presumably taking substantial steps towards demonstrating the practical utility of quantum computing.</p>

The resulting family of effective Hamiltonians reproduces the well-known Floquet-Magnus expansion, now enhanced with explicit error bounds that quantify the distance between the exact and approximate dynamics at each order, even in cases where the Floquet-Magnus series fails to converge. We apply the method to the semiclassical Rabi model and provide explicit error bounds for both the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian and its third-order refinement. Our analysis shows that, while the rotating-wave approximation more accurately captures the true dynamics than the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian in most regimes, the third-order approximation ultimately outperforms both.</p>

            <p>Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.</p>

Since the finite target gate set cannot exactly implement any given operator, approximation is often necessary. Model counting, or #SAT, has recently been demonstrated as a promising new approach for tackling core problems in quantum circuit analysis. In this work, we show for the first time that the universal quantum circuit synthesis problem can be reduced to maximum model counting. We formulate a #SAT encoding for exact and approximate depth-optimal quantum circuit synthesis into the Clifford+T gate set. We evaluate our method with an open-source implementation that uses the maximum model counter d4Max as a backend. For this purpose, we extended d4Max with support for complex and negative weights to represent amplitudes. Experimental results show that existing classical tools have potential for the quantum circuit synthesis problem.</p>

            <p>The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and computational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the correlated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to calculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum computing use case in materials science.</p>

            <p>For various optimization problems, the classical time to solution is super-polynomial and intractable to solve with classical bit-based computing hardware to date. Digital and quantum annealers have the potential to identify near-optimal solutions for such optimization problems using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem formulation. This work benchmarks two use cases to evaluate the utility of QUBO solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, in order to determine if a QUBO formulation and annealing-based algorithms have an advantage over classical mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) solvers. Various QUBO and solver metrics such as problem mapping, quantitative interconnectivity, penalty structure, solver minimum cost (obtained optimal value) and solver time to solution have been applied to evaluate different QUBO problems. Constrained and unconstrained QUBO solvers are compared including the Fujitsu digital annealer (DA), various D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing solvers (QA, HQA), and the classical MIP/CP solvers HiGHS, Gurobi, SCIP, and CP-SAT. The two industrially relevant use cases are reaction network pathway analysis and mRNA codon selection. For reaction pathway analysis, classical MIP/CP solvers (especially Gurobi and CP-SAT) are observed to solve the problem to optimality in reasonable time frames. For mRNA codon selection, Gurobi outperformed all other solvers in time to solution for all problem sizes, followed by CP-SAT and the D-Wave Nonlinear (NL) HQA solver.</p>

Through meticulous data preprocessing (downsampling, binarization), quantum encoding (FRQI and compressed FRQI), and the design of QNN architectures (CRADL and CRAML), we demonstrate that QNNs can effectively handle high-dimensional image data.

            <p>Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on the microscopic interaction with a single atom, neglecting the crucial macroscopic aspect of light propagation through the media. This raises a key question: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media and how this affects the generation of non-linear optical signals? We address this question by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media. We find that atomic ionization caused by strong BSV fluctuations and the associated infrared photon losses introduce decoherence effects that can substantially limit the propagation length in the medium, reduce the harmonic yield, and decrease the number of emitted harmonics at high intensities. However, these effects are not detrimental. We identify conditions under which propagation-induced decoherence is minimized while the generated harmonics remain clearly detectable--an issue of particular importance for future studies exploring the connection between strong-field physics and quantum optics. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation through all states of matter in a fully quantized framework.</p>

            <h2>Excited-CAFQA: A classical simulation bootstrap for the variational estimation of molecular excited states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bikrant Bhattacharyya, Gokul Ravi</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are iterative algorithms suited to implementation on current-era quantum devices. VQAs employ classical optimization to minimize cost functions evaluated on quantum circuits. However, the extent to which VQAs manage noise is often insufficient for quantum chemistry applications. One method of improving VQAs is through accurate ansatz initialization. The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>Tensors, entanglement, separability, and their complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shmuel Friedland</p>
            <p>One of the most challenging problems in quantum physics is to quantify the entanglement of $d$-partite states and their separability. We show here that these problems are best addressed using tensors. The geometric measure of entanglement of a pure state is one of most natural ways to quantify the entanglement, which is simply related to the spectral norm of a tensor state. On the other hand, the logarithm of the nuclear norm of the state and density tensors can be considered as its ``energy''. We first show that the most geometric measure entangled $d$-partite state has the minimum spectral norm and maximum nuclear norm. Second, we introduce the notion of Hermitian and density tensors, and the subspace of bi-symmetric Hermitian tensors, which correspond to Bosons. We show that separable density tensors, and strongly separable bi-symmetric density tensors are characterized by the value (equal to one) of their corresponding nuclear norms. In general, these characterizations are NP-hard to verify. Third, we show that the above quantities are computed in polynomial time when we restrict our attentions to Bosons: symmetric $d$-qubits, or more generally to symmetric $d$-qunits in $C^n$, and the corresponding bi-symmetric Hermtian density tensors, for a fixed value of $n$.</p>

By mapping the reconstruction cost function onto an Ising model, the problem can be solved using a variational eigensolver on present-day quantum hardware.

Our results highlight the potential of variational algorithms for efficient quantum state tomography, particularly for high-dimensional structured light, where classical approaches can face bottlenecks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Connor Clayton, Bruno Avritzer</p>
            <p>Modular quantum computing architectures require error correction schemes that remain effective in the presense of noisy inter-processor operations. We introduce a distributed quantum error correction framework based on approximate codes to address this challenge. Our approach enables concatenation of distinct local codes across modules while allowing logical operations composed primarily of processor-local gates. We derive a lower bound and present corresponding simulations which indicate that this nontraditional approach can provide marked advantage over existing approaches in the highly non-uniform error landscape of a distributed quantum computer. As a concrete realization, we present encoding and decoding circuits for the permutation-invariant W- state code and propose efficient methods for its preparation.

            <h2>Quantum Network-Based Prediction of Cancer Driver Genes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patricia Marques, Andreas Wichert, Duarte Magano, Bruno Coutinho</p>
            <p>Identification of cancer driver genes is fundamental for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. The integration of mutational profiles with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks offers a promising avenue for their detection [ 1, 2], but scaling to large network datasets is computationally demanding. Quantum computing offers compact representations and potential complexity reductions. Motivated by the classical method of Gumpinger et al. [3], in this work we introduce a supervised quantum framework that combines mutation scores with network topology via a novel state preparation scheme, Quantum Multi-order Moment Embedding (QMME). QMME encodes low-order statistical moments over the mutation scores of a node's immediate and second-order neighbors, and encodes this information into quantum states. These are used as inputs to a kernel-based quantum binary classifier that discriminates known driver genes from others. Simulations on an empirical PPI network demonstrate competitive performance, with a 12.6% recall gain over a classical baseline. The pipeline performs explicit quantum state preparation and requires no classical training, enabling an efficient, nearly end-to-end quantum workflow. A brief complexity analysis suggests the approach could achieve a quantum speedup in network-based cancer gene prediction. This work underscores the potential of supervised quantum graph learning frameworks to advance biological discovery.</p>

            <p>We show that spin-flip probabilities emerge in the relativistic regime for scalar potentials, absent in the standard Dirac representation. We examine 1D scattering for the Dirac equation employing an alternate matrix representation introduced by the Author in an earlier study. We demonstrate that the transmission (T) and reflection (R) coefficients can depend on the chosen representation of the Clifford algebra despite the two representations being related by a unitary or non-unitary transformation. We also show that for the non-unitary case quantum interference may arise in scattering phenomena, a testable experimental signature. This representation dependence hints at hidden physics in how spinor components couple to external steps/barriers, even when the relativistic dispersion relation (E^2=p^2+m^2) is the same.</p>

            <p>Emergent quantum networks are the essential ingredient for securely connecting multiple users worldwide, extensively deployed in both fibre and free-space. An essential element is the multiplexing of entanglement to multiple users, overcoming the peer-to-peer restriction of quantum key distribution (QKD), so far successfully shown in fibre-based architectures. Here, we demonstrate a free-space quantum space division multiplexing architecture using just one entanglement source to realise a fully connected twelve-channel quantum network for seamless QKD connections between six users. The network achieves record coincidence rates exceeding $3 \times 10^{4}$ s$^{-1}$ between any pair of nodes on the network, for sifted key rate of over 400 kbps. Our approach overcomes the active switching hurdle that has hindered the free-space deployment of quantum multiplexing, is fully passive, easily scalable to more nodes and compatible with fibre-based integration, thus opening a new path to scalable and resource-efficient quantum networks that utilise free-space links.</p>

We show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is subsequently broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</p>

            <h2>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</p>

            <p>Machine learning-assisted diagnosis shows promise, yet medical imaging datasets are often scarce, imbalanced, and constrained by privacy, making data augmentation essential. Classical generative models typically demand extensive computational and sample resources. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods remain limited in scale and often face barren plateaus. We present MediQ-GAN, a quantum-inspired GAN with prototype-guided skip connections and a dual-stream generator that fuses classical and quantum-inspired branches. Its variational quantum circuits inherently preserve full-rank mappings, avoid rank collapse, and are theory-guided to balance expressivity with trainability. Beyond generation quality, we provide the first latent-geometry and rank-based analysis of quantum-inspired GANs, offering theoretical insight into their performance. Across three medical imaging datasets, MediQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models. While validated on IBM hardware for robustness, our contribution is hardware-agnostic, offering a scalable and data-efficient framework for medical image generation and augmentation.</p>

            <p>We present a machine-learning workflow for the calculation of the infrared spectrum of molecules, and more generally of other temperature-dependent electronic observables. The main idea is to use the Jacobi-Legendre cluster expansion to predict the real-space charge density of a converged density-functional-theory calculation. This gives us access to both energy and forces, and to electronic observables such as the dipole moment or the electronic gap. Thus, the same model can simultaneously drive a molecular dynamics simulation and evaluate electronic quantities along the trajectory, namely it has access to the same information of ab-initio molecular dynamics. A similar approach within the framework of machine-learning force fields would require the training of multiple models, one for the molecular dynamics and others for predicting the electronic quantities. The scheme is implemented here within the numerical framework of the PySCF code and applied to the infrared spectrum of the uracil molecule in the gas phase.</p>

            <h2>Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ross H. McKenzie</p>
            <p>Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</p>

            <p>Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronak M Soni</p>
            <p>In some cases in two and three bulk dimensions without bulk local degrees of freedom, I look for area operators in a fixed boundary theory. In each case, I define an exact quantum error-correcting code (QECC) and show that it admits a central decomposition. However, the area operator that arises from this central decomposition vanishes. A non-zero area operator, however, emerges after coarse-graining. The expectation value of this operator approximates the actual entanglement entropy for a class of states that do not form a linear subspace. These non-linear constraints can be interpreted as semiclassicality conditions. The coarse-grained area operator is ambiguous, and this ambiguity can be matched with that in defining fixed-area states.</p>

We design a closed-loop workflow between the quantum processors and 152,064 classical nodes of Fugaku, to approximate the electronic structure of chemistry models beyond the reach of exact diagonalization, with accuracy comparable to some all-classical approximation methods.

            <h2>Quantum-dot single photon source performance with off-resonant pulse preparation schemes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gavin Crowder, Lora Ramunno, Stephen Hughes</p>
            <p>The preparation of photonic qubits in the excited state is an integral part of the performance of an on-demand single photon source (SPS). Conventional resonant excitation, an excellent approach to maximize the coherence and indistinguishability of the SPS, often requires polarization filtering to remove the pump signal and isolate the qubit emission, but this results in an inherent 50\% hit to the efficiency. Recent excitation schemes strategically try to exploit pulses that excite the qubit while avoiding spectral overlap to bypass this required filtering. In this work, we compare three such pumping schemes to quantify the important SPS figures-of-merit for off-resonant quantum dot schemes, using: (i) a symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulse, (ii) a notch-filtered adiabatic rapid passage (NARP) pulse, and (iii) a swing up of the quantum emitter population (SUPER) pulse. Due to large instantaneous pulse strengths, the dichromatic pulse suffers from phonon-induced dephasing which can lower the SPS performance by up to 50\%. In contrast, the NARP and SUPER pulses are shielded from phonon coupling to differing degrees but both maintain excellent SPS performance. The SUPER pulse can lose significant efficiency if there is variance in its constituent pulses' amplitude, pulse width, or frequency, while the NARP pulse, though potentially more difficult to realize in experiments, is robust against variance in the pulse preparation.</p>

            <h2>Optimal transfer of entanglement in oscillator chains in non-Markovian open systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Wei Luo, Edward Yu, Ting Yu</p>
            <p>We considered the transfer of continuous-variable entangled states in coupled oscillator chains embedded in a generic environment. We demonstrate high-fidelity transfer via optimal control in two configurations - a linear chain and an X-shaped chain. More specifically, we use the Krotov optimization algorithm to design control fields that achieve the desired state transfer. Under the environmental memory effects, the Krotov algorithm needs to be modified, since the dissipative terms in non-Markovian dynamics are generally governed by the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. Remarkably, we can achieve high-fidelity transfer by simply tuning the frequencies of the oscillators while keeping the coupling strength constant, even in the presence of open-system effects. For the system under consideration, we find that quantum memory effects can aid in the transfer of entanglement and show improvement over the memoryless case. In addition, it is possible to target a range of entangled states, making it unnecessary to know the parameters of the initial state beforehand.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing crucially relies on maintaining quantum coherence for the duration of a calculation. Bosonic quantum error correction protects this coherence by encoding qubits into superpositions of noise-resilient oscillator states. In the case of the Kerr-cat qubit (KCQ), these states derive their stability from being the quasi-degenerate ground states of an engineered Hamiltonian in a driven nonlinear oscillator. KCQs are experimentally compatible with on-chip architectures and high-fidelity operations, making them promising candidates for a scalable bosonic quantum processor. However, their bit-flip time must increase further to fully leverage these advantages. Here, we present direct evidence that the bit-flip time in a KCQ is limited by leakage out of the qubit manifold and experimentally mitigate this process. We coherently control the leakage population and measure it to be > 9%, twelve times higher than in the undriven system. We then cool this population back into the KCQ manifold with engineered dissipation, identify conditions under which this suppresses bit-flips, and demonstrate increased bit-flip times up to 3.6 milliseconds. By employing both Hamiltonian confinement and engineered dissipation, our experiment combines two paradigms for Schrödinger-cat qubit stabilization. Our results elucidate the interplay between these stabilization processes and indicate a path towards fully realizing the potential of these qubits for quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Describing systems of superconducting atoms coupled to a continuum of photonic modes at multiple separated locations in a waveguide, waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) with giant atoms has emerged as a promising platform for realizing quantum interconnect. Such systems have been reported to exhibit rich phenomena that differ from those of natural atoms. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov and Wigner-Weisskopf approximations, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of one and two giant atoms interacting with a waveguide formed by an array of coupled resonators. We discover that the diverse dynamical behaviors of the giant atoms are intrinsically determined by the energy spectrum of the composite system consisting of the giant atoms and the photonic modes in the waveguide. As long as one and more bound states are present in the energy spectrum, their excited-state probabilities, respectively, tend to stable finite values and lossless Rabi-like oscillations with frequencies proportional to the differences of the bound-state eigenenergies. Our result provides an insightful guideline for suppressing the decoherence of giant atoms and facilitates the development of quantum interconnect devices using giant-atom waveguide QED.</p>

            <p>Resonant coupling of a vibration to a cavity mode has been reported to dramatically modify spontaneous Raman scattering, but subsequent studies have produced conflicting results. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic quantum framework that captures the spatial structure of polaritonic modes. In a homogeneously filled cavity, spatial overlap between polaritons and cavity resonances enforces selection rules that suppress the initially reported polaritonic Raman peaks, consistent with most experiments. In contrast, for a quasi-two-dimensional (2d) molecular layer, these rules are lifted, yielding Raman peaks at the polariton energies. Our work clarifies that the Raman response under vibrational strong coupling is determined by cavity-vibration spatial mode overlap and offers a framework for Raman studies of strongly coupled quasi-2d systems.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.</p>

            <p>Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Single-Photon-Level Atomic Frequency Comb Storage in Room Temperature Alkali Vapour</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zakary Schofield, Vanderli Laurindo Jr, Ori Ezrah Mor, Patrick M. Ledingham</p>
            <p>We have demonstrated the coherent storage and retrieval of single-photon-level light using the atomic frequency comb protocol in a room temperature rubidium vapour. Velocity-selective optical pumping is used to prepare the comb within the $F=2$ hyperfine ground state of rubidium, with the spacing between peaks coinciding with half the $F = 2 - F =3$ hyperfine splitting of the $5^2$P$_{3/2}$ excited state. Weak coherent states of average photon number $\mu_\mathrm{in} = 0.083(5)$ are stored with pre-programmed recall time of $7.5\,$ns with an efficiency of $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} = 6.59(5)\,\%$, while two temporally distinct modes have been stored and recalled with $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} = 2.6(1)\,\%$, allowing for time-bin qubit storage. Finally, the efficiency is observed to be independent of the input pulse polarisation, paving the way for polarisation qubit storage.</p>

            <h2>Zitterbewegung Effect and Quantum Geometry in Non-Hermitian Exciton-Polariton Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yow-Ming Robin Hu, Elena A. Ostrovskaya, Eliezer Estrecho</p>
            <p>In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane effective field.</p>

            <h2>Manipulating Excitation Dynamics in Structured Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Ya-Tang Yu, Wei-Hsuan Chung, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) has become a central platform for studying collective light-matter interactions in low-dimensional photonic environments. While conventional wQED systems rely on uniform chirality or reciprocal emitter-waveguide coupling, we propose a structured wQED framework, where the coupling directionality of each emitter can be engineered locally to control excitation transport in an atom-nanophotonic interface. For different combinations of patterned coupling directionalities of the emitters, we identify four representative configurations that exhibit distinct dynamical behaviors: centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion excitations. Spectral analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian reveals that these dynamics originate from interferences among subradiant eigenmodes. Variance analysis further quantifies the spreading of excitation as functions of interatomic spacing and global chirality, showing tunable localization-delocalization transitions. Including nonguided losses, we find that the transport characteristics remain robust for realistic coupling efficiencies (beta >= 0.99). These results establish structured wQED as a practical route to manipulate excitation localization, coherence, and transport through programmable directionality patterns, paving the way for controllable subradiant transport and chiral quantum information routing.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation aims to recreate complex many-body phenomena in controlled environments, offering insights into dynamics that are otherwise difficult to model. Existing platforms, however, are often complex and costly to scale, typically requiring ultra-pure vacuum or low temperatures. Here, we realize a room-temperature quantum simulator using a thin ${}^{13}\text{C}$ nuclear spin layer in diamond. Nearby nitrogen-vacancy centers enable polarization, readout, and, combined with radio-frequency fields, coherent control of the nuclear spins. We demonstrate strong, tunable interactions among the nuclear spins and use the system to investigate discrete time-crystalline order. By combining ease of use with operation at ambient temperatures, our work opens new opportunities for investigating strongly correlated many-body effects.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks, which integrate multiple quantum computers and the channels connecting them, are crucial for distributed quantum information processing but remain inherently susceptible to channel noise. Channel purification emerges as a promising technique for suppressing noise in quantum channels without complex encoding and decoding operations, making it particularly suitable for remote quantum information transmission in optical systems. In this work, we introduce an experimental setup for efficient channel purification, harnessing the spatial and polarization properties of photons. Our design employs two Fredkin gates to enable coherent interference between independent noise channels, achieving effective noise suppression across a wide range of noise levels and types. Through application to entanglement distribution, our protocol demonstrates a superior capability to preserve entanglement against channel noise compared to conventional entanglement purification methods.</p>

            <h2>Quantum interference effects in two-photon scattering by a macroscopic lossy sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Ciattoni</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum optical scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a macroscopic lossy sphere by means of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in the form of modified Langevin noise formalism. The two ingoing photons with arbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two different directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering involves the three independent processes where two, one and zero outgoing photons survive. Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of two different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing interference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is governed by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational invariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such that the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect constructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric and antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses on quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the scattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy spheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like traits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects, occurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency and side Fano dip frequency, respectively. In addition we consider the overall scattering probabilities of two, one and zero photons and we prove that, at the Mie resonance frequencies, they exhibit quantum interference effects which are extremely sensitive to the spectral symmetry of the input wavepacket, thus suggesting an efficient spectral technique assisted by matter losses to identify entanglement.</p>

            <h2>High-Q microresonators unveil quantum rare events</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sricharan Raghavan-Chitra, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>Classical linear optics posits that at sufficiently low intensities, light propagation in dielectric media is governed solely by their linear susceptibilities. Here, we demonstrate a departure from this paradigm in high-Q microresonators, where prolonged photon confinement enables rare quantum electrodynamical (QED) events, mediated by the quantum vacuum, to embed distinctive Raman signatures of the coupled analyte into the resonator's linear transmission spectrum despite their absence from the linear susceptibility. We further show that increasing the amount of adsorbed analyte amplifies these Raman fingerprints well above typical noise floors, rendering them experimentally accessible with state-of-the-art photonic architectures and detection schemes. This novel weak-coupling cavity-QED effect offers unique routes to harness extended photon lifetimes and constrained geometries for leveraging vacuum fluctuations in next-generation photonic technologies for chemical and biological sensing and high-precision optical spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Preservation and Clauser-Horne Nonlocality in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Quantum Memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Han Tseng, Yong-Fan Chen</p>
            <p>Entanglement preservation in noisy quantum memories represents a long-standing conceptual challenge in quantum information science. While experiments have shown that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) memories can store entangled photons, a rigorous theoretical demonstration of whether such memories fundamentally preserve nonlocality has remained elusive. Here we develop a unified open-system model that combines the dark-state polariton formalism with reduced density operator theory to describe the retrieved photon state under realistic ground state decoherence. The analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably transforms an initially pure Bell state into a mixed state and predicts a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Above this threshold, the retrieved photon violates the Clauser-Horne inequality, confirming the preservation of nonlocal quantum correlations, whereas below it, nonlocality is lost. This work provides the first systematic theoretical proof that EIT quantum memories can in principle preserve entanglement and nonlocality, thereby resolving a fundamental question in the physics of quantum information storage.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical quantum codes and logic gates on a lattice with sparse connectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominic J. Williamson, Bence Hetényi</p>
            <p>We introduce several dynamical schemes that take advantage of mid-circuit measurement and nearest-neighbor gates on a lattice with maximum vertex degree three to implement topological codes and perform logic gates between them. We first review examples of Floquet codes and their implementation with nearest-neighbor gates and ancillary qubits. Next, we describe implementations of these Floquet codes that make use of the ancillary qubits to reset all qubits every measurement cycle. We then show how switching the role of data and ancilla qubits allows a pair of Floquet codes to be implemented simultaneously. We describe how to perform a logical Clifford gate to entangle a pair of Floquet codes that are implemented in this way. Finally, we show how switching between the color code and a pair of Floquet codes, via a depth-two circuit followed by mid-circuit measurement, can be used to perform syndrome extraction for the color code.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear quantum evolution of a dissipative superconducting qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Orion Lee, Qian Cao, Yogesh N. Joglekar, Kater Murch</p>
            <p>Unitary and dissipative models of quantum dynamics are linear maps on the space of states or density matrices. This linearity encodes the superposition principle, a key feature of quantum theory. However, this principle can break down in effective non-Hermitian dynamics arising from postselected quantum evolution. We theoretically characterize and experimentally investigate this breakdown in a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Within the circuit's three-level manifold, no-jump postselection generates an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the excited two-level subspace and an anti-Hermitian nonlinearity. We prepare different initial states and use quantum state tomography to track their evolution under this effective, nonlinear Hamiltonian. By comparing the evolution of a superposition-state to a superposition of individually-evolved basis states, we test linearity and observe clear violations which we quantify across the exceptional-point (EP) degeneracy of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the analysis to density matrices, revealing a breakdown in linearity for the two-level subspace while demonstrating that linearity is preserved in the full three-level system. These results provide direct evidence of nonlinearity in non-Hermitian quantum evolution, highlighting unique features that are absent in classical non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Heuristic Quantum Advantage with Peaked Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hrant Gharibyan, Mohammed Zuhair Mullath, Nicholas E. Sherman, Vincent P. Su, Hayk Tepanyan, Yuxuan Zhang</p>
            <p>We design and demonstrate heuristic quantum advantage with peaked circuits (HQAP circuits) on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum processor. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies, we identify a clear gap between classical and quantum runtimes. Our largest instance involves all-to-all connectivity with 2000 two-qubit gates, which H2 can produce the target peaked bitstring directly in under 2 hours. Our extrapolations from leading classical simulation techniques such as tensor networks with belief propagation and Pauli path simulators indicate the same instance would take years on exascale systems (Frontier, Summit), suggesting a potentially exponential separation. This work marks an important milestone toward verifiable quantum advantage, as well as providing a useful benchmarking protocol for current utility-scale quantum hardware. We sketch our protocol for designing these circuits and provide extensive numerical results leading to our extrapolation estimates. Separate from our constructed HQAP circuits, we prove hardness on a decision problem involving generic peaked circuits. When both the input and output bitstrings of a peaked circuit are unknown, determining whether the circuit is peaked constitutes a QCMA-complete problem, meaning the problem remains hard even for a quantum polynomial-time machine under commonly accepted complexity assumptions. Inspired by this observation, we propose an application of the peaked circuits as a potentially quantum-safe encryption scheme~\cite{chen2016report,kumar2020post,joseph2022transitioning,dam2023survey}. We make our peaked circuits publicly available and invite the community to try additional methods to solve these circuits to see if this gap persists even with novel classical techniques.</p>

            <p>The Perceval Challenge is an open, reproducible benchmark designed to assess the potential of photonic quantum computing for machine learning. Focusing on a reduced and hardware-feasible version of the MNIST digit classification task or near-term photonic processors, it offers a concrete framework to evaluate how photonic quantum circuits learn and generalize from limited data. Conducted over more than three months, the challenge attracted 64 teams worldwide in its first phase. After an initial selection, 11 finalist teams were granted access to GPU resources for large-scale simulation and photonic hardware execution through cloud service. The results establish the first unified baseline of photonic machine-learning performance, revealing complementary strengths between variational, hardware-native, and hybrid approaches. This challenge also underscores the importance of open, reproducible experimentation and interdisciplinary collaboration, highlighting how shared benchmarks can accelerate progress in quantum-enhanced learning. All implementations are publicly available in a single shared repository (this https URL), supporting transparent benchmarking and cumulative research. Beyond this specific task, the Perceval Challenge illustrates how systematic, collaborative experimentation can map the current landscape of photonic quantum machine learning and pave the way toward hybrid, quantum-augmented AI workflows.</p>

            <h2>GHZ-Preserving Gates and Optimized Distillation Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyuan Wang, Guus Avis, Stefan Krastanov</p>
            <p>Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states play a central role in quantum computing and communication protocols, as a typical multipartite entanglement resource. This work introduces an efficient enumeration and simulation method for circuits that preserve and distill noisy GHZ states, significantly reducing the simulation complexity of a gate on $n$ qubits, from exponential $O(2^n)$ for standard state-vector methods or $O(n)$ for Clifford circuits, to a constant $O(1)$ for the method presented here. This method has profound implications for the design of quantum networks, where preservation and purification of entanglement with minimal resource overhead is critical. In particular, we demonstrate the use of the new method in an optimization procedure enabled by the fast simulation, that discovers GHZ distillation circuits far outperforming the state of the art. Fine-tuning to arbitrary noise models is possible as well. We also show that the method naturally extends to graph states that are local Clifford equivalent to GHZ states.</p>

            <p>Displacement sensing is a fundamental task in metrology. However, the development of quantum-enhanced sensors that fully utilize the available degrees of freedom in many-body quantum systems remains an outstanding challenge. We propose novel many-body displacement sensing schemes that use spin-dependent squeezed (SDS) states -- hybrid spin-boson states whose bosonic squeezed quadrature is conditioned on an auxiliary spin. We prove that SDS states are \emph{optimal}, i.e. their quantum Cramér-Rao bound saturates the Heisenberg limit. We propose explicit measurement sequences that can be readily implemented in systems such as trapped ions. We also introduce a scalable state-preparation protocol and numerically demonstrate the preparation of $8.7$~dB of spin-dependent squeezing $15$ times faster than the standard approach using second-order sidebands in trapped ions. The potential applications of our sensing protocols range from measuring single-photon scattering to searches for dark matter.</p>

            <p>We study the emergence of quantum memory effects in a spin-boson system at finite temperature driven by an external time-periodic force. Quantifying memory effects by the trace-distance based measure for non-Markovianity and performing numerical simulations employing the hierarchical equations of motion approach, we find a pronounced peak structure when plotting the non-Markovianity measure as a function of the driving amplitude. This distinctive feature is interpreted using Floquet theory and the Floquet-Lindblad master equation, associating the peaks with the degeneracies of the quasienergy spectrum which lead to a strong enhancement of the relaxation times of the system. These results suggest strategies for the efficient control of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems by periodic driving.</p>

            <p>We study the impact of static disorder on a globally-controlled superconducting quantum computing architecture based on a quasi-two-dimensional ladder geometry [R. Menta et al., Phys. Rev. Research 7, L012065 (2025)]. Specifically, we examine how fabrication-induced inhomogeneities in qubit resonant frequencies and coupling strengths affect quantum state propagation and the fidelity of fundamental quantum operations. Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>The active stabilization of polarization channels is a task of growing importance as quantum networks move to deployed demonstrations over existing fiber infrastructure. However, the uniquely strict requirements for high-fidelity qubit transmission complicate the extent to which classical solutions may apply to future quantum networks, particularly in terms of recognizing noise sources present in low-flux, nonunitary channels. Here we introduce a novel in situ benchmarking approach that augments a classical polarization tracking system, limited to unitary correction, with simultaneously transmitted quantum light for ancilla-assisted process tomography of the full quantum map. Implemented in a local-area quantum network, our method uses the reconstructed map both to validate the classical compensation and to expose noise sources it fails to capture. A sliding measurement window that continuously updates the estimated quantum process further increases sensitivity to rapid channel fluctuations. Our results should unlock new opportunities for in situ channel characterization in quantum-classical coexistence networks.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical framework for quantum-coherent nonlinear interferometry in which the nonlinear medium is modeled as active electron-phonon quantum systems rather than a passive $\chi^{(2)}$ converter. By explicitly retaining the quantum coherence of the coupled electron-phonon-photon dynamics, our model describes a two-stage buildup of entanglement - first between signal and idler photons and subsequently between idler photons mediated by material coherence. This coherent light-matter interaction imprints the internal dynamics of the medium onto the interferometer output, yielding phase-sensitive interference that enables indirect readout of terahertz-band signal modes via near-infrared detection. The results reveal a route toward entanglement-assisted terahertz sensing and establish a general framework for treating nonlinear quantum media as active components in interferometric architectures.</p>

            <p>We propose a fundamentally new design strategy of light-pulsed atom interferometry (LPAI) with a single atomic beam splitter. A traditional $\pi/2$-pulse Raman beam is employed to render a small momentum transfer at the initial state. After a short period of evolution during which physical relevant information can be loaded, a quantum weak measurement is applied to the internal state of the atoms. The final information will be detected from the transmission spectrum of a probe light to obviate the measurement of florescence signal. An effective amplification of the order of $10^3$ about the momentum offset is achieved in our simulation employing $Cs$ atoms with current experimental condition. Our proposal offers a cost-effective, high-accuracy measurement and readout strategy for LPAI. Furthermore, the strategy makes the physical setup much simpler and more compact offering new direction towards portable sensitive LPAI.</p>

            <p>In quantum networks, after passing through noisy channels or information processing, residual states may lack sufficient entanglement for further tasks, yet they may retain hidden quantum resources that can be recycled. Efficiently recycling these states to extract entanglement resources such as genuine multipartite entanglement or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs is essential for optimizing network performance. Here, we develop a tripartite entanglement distillation scheme using an eight-photon quantum platform, demonstrating entanglement superactivation phenomena which are unique to multipartite systems. We successfully generate a three-photon genuinely entangled state from two bi-separable states via local operations and classical communication, demonstrating superactivation of genuine multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, we extend our scheme to generate a three-photon state capable of extracting an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair from two initial states lacking this capability, revealing a previously unobserved entanglement superactivation phenomenon. Our methods and findings offer not only practical applications for quantum networks, but also lead to a deeper understanding of multipartite entanglement structures.</p>

Here, we propose a quantum analogue of predator-prey dynamics using a tunable two-dimensional Rydberg atom array. Through mean-field analysis and numerical simulations based on the open-system discrete truncated Wigner approximation, we demonstrate that Rydberg excitations exhibit predator-prey cycles on microsecond timescales. We show that quantum coherence drives spontaneous symmetry breaking, while long-range interactions stabilize global oscillations against quantum-noise-induced desynchronization. We further reveal that quantum jump induce quasicycles whose amplitude scales inversely with the square root of the system size. Our work extends the study of predator-prey models to the quantum realm and advances quantum simulation stratagies that leverage engineered many-body nonequilibrium effects.</p>

            <p>Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Syed M. Arslan, Syed Shahmir, Noureldin Mohammad, Saif Al-Kuwari, Muataz Alhussein</p>
            <p>Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) has emerged as a potential protocol for long distance secure communication, overcoming the rate-distance limitations of conventional quantum key distribution without requiring trusted repeaters. By having two parties transmit phase encoded weak coherent pulses (WCP) to an untrusted central node, the TF-QKD exploits single-photon interference to achieve secret key rates scaling as square-root of channel length, enabling quantum-secured communication over unprecedented distances. This survey provides a comprehensive survey of TF-QKD, covering the original protocol, its fundamental principles, and key-rate derivation. We discuss major TF-QKD variants, including Phase-Matching QKD and Sending-or-Not-Sending QKD, with various improved versions. We compare their performance, implementation trade-offs, protocol-specific vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. The survey summarizes security proofs ranging from asymptotic decoy-state analyses to finite-key composable frameworks, experimental milestones, technological enablers, and practical deployment challenges. Finally, we outline open problems in the field and present a roadmap for integrating TF-QKD into scalable quantum networks, underscoring its central role in the future quantum internet.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution is a key application of quantum mechanics, shaping the future of privacy and secure communications. Many protocols require single photons, often approximated by strongly attenuated laser pulses. Here, we harness the emission of a quantum dot embedded in a micropillar and explore a hybrid approach where the information is encoded on a mixture of single photons and laser pulses. We derive a phenomenological analysis of the configuration where both sources of light are mixed incoherently to perform the BB84 protocol, showing nearly perfect matching between theory and experiment. This provides a flexible technology compensating limited collected brightnesses of single-photon sources as well as a thorough investigation of single-photon statistics advantage scenarios over Poisson-distributed statistics. Explicitly, our model highlights an efficiency threshold for unconditional advantage of single photons over laser along with insights on the interplay between single-photon purity and collected brightness in the performances of BB84.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement and Thermodynamic Scaling Laws in Quantum Superabsorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan David Álvarez-Cuartas, John H. Reina</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs) exploit collective quantum resources to surpass the limits of classical energy storage and power delivery. We analyze $N$-qubit cavity-coupled QBs governed by Dicke and Tavis--Cummings models under Gaussian driving and open-system dynamics. Finite-size scaling laws $\mathcal{O}(N)\!\sim\!N^{\alpha}$ demonstrate an optimal region of relaxation and dephasing where coherent driving stabilizes entanglement entropy growth for thermodynamic observables (maximum energy $E_{\mathrm{max}}$, charging time $\tau$, and maximum power $\bar{P}_{\mathrm{max}}$) and for qubit and cavity entanglement entropies. The Dicke model exhibits entropy-suppressed extensive behavior, while the Tavis--Cummings model achieves super-extensive scaling with $\alpha_{E_{\mathrm{max}}}\!\in\![1.08,1.26]$, $\alpha_{\tau}\!\approx\!-0.49$, $\alpha_{\bar{P}_{\mathrm{max}}}\!\in\![1.57,1.73]$, supported by qubit-cavity entanglement. We demonstrate that dissipation can act as a stabilizer source, yielding scaling benchmarks that are relevant to several experimental platforms. Our findings connect entanglement, dissipation-enhanced scaling laws and superabsorption, outlining a pathway towards scalable quantum batteries offering practical quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing the reachability of variational quantum algorithms via input-state design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaojun Wu, Shan Jin, Abolfazl Bayat, Xiaoting Wang</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) face an inherent trade-off between expressivity and trainability: deeper circuits can represent richer states but suffer from noise accumulation and barren plateaus, while shallow circuits remain trainable and implementable but lack expressive power. Here, we propose a general framework to address this challenge by enhancing the VQA performance with a specially designed input state constructed using a linear combination technique. This approach systematically modified the set of states reachable by the original circuit, enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. We provide a rigorous proof that such framework increases the expressive capacity of any given VQA ansatz, and demonstrate its broad applicability across different ansatz families. As applications, we apply the method to ground-state preparation of the transverse-field Ising, cluster-Ising, and Fermi-Hubbard models, achieving consistently higher accuracy under the same gate budget compared with standard VQAs. These results highlight input-state design as a powerful complement to circuit design in realizing VQAs that are both expressive and trainable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriella G. Damas, Ciro Micheletti Diniz, Norton G. de Almeida, Celso J. Villas-Bôas, G. D. de Moraes Neto</p>
            <p>We present a practical design framework for high-fidelity quantum control in coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, directly addressing the challenge of spectral crowding. We show that systematic spectral degeneracies, which hinder selective addressing, are a direct consequence of rational Kerr-nonlinearity ratios ($K_1/K_2$). Our solution is a universal architectural principle: engineer this ratio to be a complex rational value, approximating an incommensurate number to systematically eliminate parasitic resonances. Using a Magnus expansion, we derive a complete effective Hamiltonian, including all Stark-shift corrections, to accurately target transitions. We numerically validate this framework by demonstrating protocols for the deterministic synthesis of NOON states, and high-photon-number Fock states (e.g., $n=4$), achieving ideal fidelities exceeding $\mathcal{F}>99.9\%$. The protocols are shown to be robust against environmental decay and thermal effects. This work provides an architectural blueprint for bosonic processors in circuit QED and establishes foundational principles that could inform future designs of multi-mode quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Generation and detection of squeezed states via a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator</h2>

            <p>A synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) operating at 93 MHz is used to generate squeezed states at 1035 nm. The system features a counter-propagating beam at the same wavelength as the quantum state, which simultaneously actively stabilizes the cavity and, after transmission, acts as the local oscillator for homodyne detection. By deriving the local oscillator directly from the SPOPO cavity, the setup establishes an intrinsically excellent spatial mode overlap and high interference visibility, forming a distinctive self-referenced architecture. Two spatial light modulators enable precise spectral shaping of both the pump and the local oscillator in amplitude and phase, allowing investigation of the spectral properties of the generated states. The versatility of the setup further allows exploration of different SPOPO configurations, including regimes with varied finesse and escape efficiency. Representative measurements, including homodyne traces and squeezing levels as functions of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth, demonstrate the performance of the system. Theoretical simulations based on a multimode singular-value-decomposition model reproduce well the measured dependence of squeezing on pump power and LO bandwidth, confirming the accuracy of the description and the robustness of the setup. Measured squeezing levels up to -3.3 dB are achieved, corresponding to -5.7 dB at SPOPO output, evidencing the robustness and versatility of this platform for stable pulsed squeezed-light generation and advanced quantum optical applications.</p>

By distributing and recollecting the quantum state with an entanglement-distribution operation, the scan rate scales as $N^2(m+1)$ while thermal excitation is the dominant background, significantly outperforming classical single-cavity methods under matched conditions. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme against additional noise sources, including decoherence and beamsplitter infidelity, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In practice, the key requirements, namely high-Q superconducting radio-frequency cavities that support long integration times, high-fidelity microwave beamsplitters, and universal cavity control, are already available on current experimental platforms, making the protocol experimentally feasible.</p>

            <h2>Approximate quantum error correction, eigenstate thermalization and the chaos bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shozab Qasim, Jason Pollack</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely independently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we establish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy of time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Witnessing genuine multipartite entanglement in phase space with controlled Gaussian unitaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Htoo Zaw, Jiajie Guo, Qiongyi He, Shuheng Liu, Matteo Fadel</p>
            <p>Many existing genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) witnesses for continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems typically rely on quadrature measurements, which is challenging to implement in platforms where the CV degrees of freedom can be indirectly accessed only through qubit readouts. In this work, we propose methods to implement GME witnesses through phase-space measurements in state-of-the-art experimental platforms, leveraging controlled Gaussian unitaries readily available in qubit-CV architectures. Based on two theoretical results showing that sufficient Wigner negativity can certify GME, we present five concrete implementation schemes using controlled parity, displacement, and beamsplitter operations. Our witnesses can detect paradigmatic GME states like the Dicke and multipartite $N00N$ states, which include the W states as a special case, and GHZ-type entangled cat states. We analyze the performance of these witnesses under realistic noise conditions and finite measurement resolution, showing their robustness to experimental imperfections. Crucially, our implementations require exponentially fewer measurement settings than full tomography, with one scheme requiring only a single measurement on auxiliary modes. The methods are readily applicable to circuit/cavity quantum electrodynamics, circuit quantum acoustodynamics, as well as trapped ions and atoms systems, where such dichotomic phase-space measurements are already routinely performed as native readouts.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a promising route toward scalable quantum computation, where entanglement-assisted LOCC and circuit knitting represent two complementary approaches. The former deterministically realizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources, whereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential sampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these two paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of entanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical communication. This hybrid approach enhances both sampling and entanglement efficiency, enabling more resource-practical implementations of distributed quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Universal trade-off between irreversibility and intrinsic timescale in thermal relaxation with applications to thermodynamic inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruicheng Bao, Chaoqun Du, Zhiyu Cao, Zhonghuai Hou</p>
            <p>We establish a general lower bound for the entropy production rate (EPR) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Logarithmic-Sobolev constant that characterizes the time-scale of relaxation. This bound can be considered as an enhanced second law of thermodynamics. When applied to thermal relaxation, it reveals a universal trade-off relation between the dissipation rate and the intrinsic relaxation timescale. From this relation, a thermodynamic upper bound on the relaxation time between two given states emerges, acting as an inverse speed limit over the entire time region. We also obtain a quantum version of this upper bound, which is always tighter than its classical counterpart, incorporating an additional term due to decoherence. Remarkably, we further demonstrate that the trade-off relation remains valid for any generally non-Markovian coarse-grained relaxation dynamics, highlighting its significant applications in thermodynamic inference. This trade-off relation is a new tool in inferring EPRs in molecular dynamics simulations and practical experiments.</p>

            <p>We quantize punctured plane, $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, employing Isham's group theoretic quantization procedure. After sketching out a brief review of group theoretic quantization procedure, we apply the quantization scheme to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, corresponding to the punctured plane, $X$. Particularly, we find the canonical Lie group, $\mathscr{G}$, corresponding to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, to be $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$. We establish an algebra homomorphism between the Lie algebra corresponding to the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, and the smooth functions, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, in the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$. Making use of this homomorphism and unitary representation of the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, we deduce a quantization map that maps a subspace of classical observables, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, to self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space, $\mathscr{H}$, which is the space of all square integrable functions on $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$ with respect to the measure $\dd \mu = \dd \phi\dd\rho/(2\pi\rho)$.</p>

            <p>We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems, starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, "Möbius-type" deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, "sine-square-type" and "displacement-type" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling, instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details. Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our (1+1)-dimensional study.</p>

            <p>Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) offers broadband, per channel heralded EPR pairs, with a rich parameter space that allows its performance to be tailored for specific applications. We present a modular ZALM simulator that demonstrates how design choices affect output rate and fidelity. Built in NetSquid with QSI controllers, it exposes 20+ tunable parameters, supports IDEAL and REALISTIC modes, and provides reusable components for Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) sources, interference, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, fiber delay, active polarization gates, detectors, and lossy fiber. Physics based models capture Hong Ou Mandel (HOM) visibility, insertion loss, detector efficiency, gate errors, and attenuation. Using this tool, we map trade offs among fidelity, link distance, and entangled pairs per use, and show how SPDC bandwidth and DWDM grid spacing steer performance. Using the default configuration settings, average fidelity emains constant at 0.8 but the ebit rate decreases from 0.0175 at the source to 0.0 at 50 km; narrowing the SPDC degeneracy bandwidth increases the ebit rate significantly without affecting fidelity. The simulator enables codesign of source, filtering, and feedforward settings for specific quantum memories and integrates as a building block for end to end quantum network studies.</p>

This task can be viewed as a language generation task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic. However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3 reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written codes (39.98%).

            <p>We investigate the Josephson effect in a two-dimensional superconducting system with a smoothly and periodically varying order parameter. The order parameter is modulated along one direction while remaining uniform in the perpendicular direction, leading to a spatially periodic superconducting phase. We show that the periodicity of the order parameter determines the winding number of the eigenfunctions, which serves as a topological characterization of the system. The winding number is calculated analytically and visualized through the trajectory of the corresponding three-dimensional Bloch vector. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we obtain both plane-wave solutions describing bulk states and exponentially localized solutions that correspond to edge modes. The analytic bulk-edge connection is employed to identify the conditions under which the edge states emerge from the bulk spectrum. We find that the winding numbers depend on the boundary conditions, which differ between the plane-wave and exponential solutions. These results establish a direct connection between the spatial modulation of the order parameter, the topological structure of the eigenstates, and the emergence of edge modes in periodically modulated Josephson systems.</p>

In contrast to the standard situation involving no S-O coupling, the system exhibits long-ranged Casimir forces both in two and three dimensions ($d=2$ and $d=3$). We identify the relevant scaling variable involving the ratio $D/\nu$ of the separation between the confining walls $D$ and the S-O coupling magnitude $\nu$. We derive and discuss the corresponding scaling functions for the Casimir energy. In all the considered cases the resulting Casimir force is attractive and the S-O coupling $\nu$ has impact on its magnitude. In $d=3$ the exponent governing the decay of the Casimir force becomes modified by the presence of the S-O coupling, and its value depends on the orientation of the confining walls relative to the plane defined by the Rashba coupling. In $d=2$ the obtained Casimir force displays singular behavior in the limit of vanishing $\nu$</p>

We formulate our results as a mathematical theorem and work out two examples showing how they can be applied to stochastic Floquet dynamics under coarse-grained and quantum collisional models.</p>

            <p>The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.</p>

Un- fortunately, the original formulation of instanton theory fundamentally breaks down when trying to calculate the level splitting in asymmetric double wells, as there is no imaginary-time periodic orbit connecting the two non-degenerate minima. We have therefore developed a new formulation of instanton theory based on a projected flux correlation function that is applicable to these asymmetric systems. Comparison with exact quantum-mechanical results in one- and two-dimensional models demonstrates that it has a reasonably high accuracy, similar to that reported for instanton theory in the symmetric case. The theory is then applied to study tunneling between non-degenerate minima in the biomolecule $\alpha$-fenchol, for which we find good agree- ment with experiment. Finally, we use the connection to instanton rate theory, which is also derived from flux correlation functions, to discuss the often misunderstood relationship between tunneling splittings and reaction rate constants.</p>

            <h2>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noam Mouelle, Jeremiah Mitchell, Valerie Gibson, Ulrich Schneider</p>
            <p>Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</p>

            <p>We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</p>

            <h2>Non-Heisenbergian quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MohammadJavad Kazemi, Ghadir Jafari</p>
            <p>Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannes Leipold, Federico M. Spedalieri, Stuart Hadfield, Eleanor Rieffel</p>
            <p>Driver Hamiltonians and Mixing Operators that satisfy constraints is an important part of ansatz construction for many quantum algorithms. In this manuscript, we give general algebraic expressions for finding Hamiltonian terms and analogously unitary primitives, that satisfy constraint embeddings and use these to give complexity characterizations of the related problems. Finding operators that enforce classical constraints is proven to be NP-Complete in the general case; we also give an algorithmic procedure with worse-case polynomial runtime to find any operators with a constant locality bound - a useful result since many constraints imposed admit local operators to enforce them in practice. We then give algorithmic procedures to turn these algebraic primitives into Hamiltonian drivers and unitary mixers that can be used for Constrained Quantum Annealing (CQA) and Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) constructions by tackling practical problems related to finding an appropriate set of reduced generators and defining corresponding drivers and mixers accordingly. We apply these concepts to the construction of ansaetze for 1-in-3 SAT instances. We consider the ordinary x-mixer QAOA, a novel QAOA approach based on the maximally disjoint subset, and a QAOA approach based on the disjoint subset as well as higher order constraint satisfaction terms. We empirically benchmark these approaches on instances sized between $ 12 $ and $ 22 $, showing the best relative performance for the tailored ansaetze and that exponential curve fits on the results are consistent with a quadratic speedup by utilizing alternative ansaetze to the X-mixer. We provide general algorithmic prescriptions for finding driver or mixing terms that satisfy embedded constraints that can be utilized to probe quantum speedups for constraints problems with linear, quadratic, or even higher order polynomial constraints.</p>

            <p>Rapid progress in quantum technology has transformed quantum computing and quantum information science from theoretical possibilities into tangible engineering challenges. Breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum simulations, and quantum error correction are bringing useful quantum computation closer to fruition. These remarkable achievements have been facilitated by advances in quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV). QCVV methods and protocols enable scientists and engineers to scrutinize, understand, and enhance the performance of quantum information-processing devices. In this tutorial, we review the fundamental principles underpinning QCVV, and introduce a diverse array of QCVV tools used by quantum researchers. We define and explain QCVV's core models and concepts -- quantum states, measurements, and processes -- and illustrate how these building blocks are leveraged to examine a target system or operation. We survey and introduce protocols ranging from simple qubit characterization to advanced benchmarking methods. Along the way, we provide illustrated examples and detailed descriptions of the protocols, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss their potential scalability to future large-scale quantum computers.

            <p>This manuscript introduces a computationally efficient method to calculate the nonlinearity of a quantum feature map, as well as a method for determining whether a quantum feature map will have a high concentration of quantum states. The technique analyzes quantum operators, through an extension of the functions of von Neumann entropy and state-transition pseudo-entropy, by deriving a method to extract the entropy of an operator. The technique is denoted as operator pseudo-entropy, is rigorously derived, and is generally complex valued; as with state-transition pseudo-entropy, complex values contain a lot of information about entanglement or nonlinearity. The characteristics of a class of quantum feature maps are rigorously shown. The operator pseudo-entropy is illuminated through experiments and compared with von Neumann entropy and state-transition pseudo-entropy. We end the manuscript with open questions and potential directions for further research.</p>

We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transistors for heat flux in and out of working substance parts: harmonic vs transmon and Kerr environs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepika Bhargava, Paranjoy Chaki, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>Quantum thermal transistors have been widely studied in the context of three-qubit systems, where each qubit interacts separately with a Markovian harmonic bath. Markovianity is an assumption that is imposed on a system if the environment loses its memory within short while, while non-Markovianity is a general feature, inherently present in a large fraction of realistic scenarios. Instead of Markovian environments, here we propose a transistor in which the interaction between the working substance and an environment comprising of an infinite chain of qutrits is based on periodic collisions. We refer to the device as a working-substance thermal transistor, since the model focuses on heat currents flowing in and out of each individual qubit of the working substance to and from different parts of the system and environment. We find that the transistor effect prevails in this apparatus and we depict how the amplification of heat currents depends on the temperature of the modulating environment, the system-environment coupling strength and the interaction time. We further show that there exists a non-zero amplification even if one of the environments, that is not the modulating one, is detached from the system. Additionally, the environment, being comprised of three-level systems, allows us to consider the effects of frail perturbations in the energy-spacings of the qutrit, leading to a non-linearity in the environment. We consider non-linearities that are either of transmon- or of Kerr-type. We find parameter ranges where there is a significant amplification for both transmon- and Kerr-type non-linearities in the environment. Finally, we detect the non-Markovianity induced in the system from a non-monotonic behavior of the amplification observed with respect to time, and quantify it using the distinguishability-based measure of non-Markovianity.</p>

            <p>We present a class of linear correlation witnesses that detects bound entanglement within a three-party prepare-and-measure scenario with four-dimensional quantum messages. We relate the detection power of our witnesses for two-ququart Bloch-product-diagonal states to that of the computable cross norm-realignment (CCNR) criterion. Several bound entangled states in four or even higher dimensions, including those which are useful in metrology, can exceed the separable bound computed by reliable iterative methods. In particular, we show that a prominent two-ququart bound entangled state with a positive partial transpose (PPT) can be mixed with up to $40\%$ isotropic noise and still be detected as entangled by our prepare-and-measure witness. Furthermore, our witnesses appear to be experimentally practical, requiring only the use of qubit rotations on Alice's and Bob's sides and product qubit measurements with binary outcomes on Charlie's side.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. The latter significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states of quantum many-body scars and is responsible for the unconventional form of transport that we detect numerically. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.</p>

            <p>Quantum-chemical simulations are essential for predicting energies of chemical reactions. Accurately solving the many-body Schrödinger equation for reagent and product states of most relevant chemical process is, however, unfeasible. Quantum computing offers a pathway for predicting energies of correlated electronic systems with localized interactions. Here, we apply a quantum embedding approach for investigating oxygen reduction reactions at the electrode surface in Lithium batteries, a representative example of energetic analysis in localized chemical reactions. We employ an Active Space Selection method based on Density Difference Analysis for identifying the orbitals involved in the reaction. Leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow ansatz for state preparation, the active-space orbitals are then processed on a quantum computer. As quantum algorithms, we use Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD, and its extended version, Ext-SQD, which integrates electronic excitations into the quantum-selected electronic configuration subspace. The largest configurations are represented by quantum circuits mapped onto 80 qubits of an IBM Heron R2 quantum processing unit. For up to 12 orbitals, we are able to benchmark the quantum-computed reaction energies against results obtained with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction. For benchmarking results in active spaces as large as 32 orbitals, we resort to Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles calculations, respectively. At 27 orbitals, the Ext-SQD results exhibit prediction accuracy improvements with regard to the standard, quantum-chemical reference methods that remain computationally feasible at that scale. The results indicate the potential of sample-based quantum diagonalization for performing high-accuracy reaction modeling in chemistry and materials science.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic instruments to static or slowly-varying quantities. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis methods, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically-important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry (SPM). Here we adapt estimation control techniques introduced in [PRX Quantum 6, 030331 (2025)] to the experimental setting of SPM and analogous techniques. We demonstrate that real-time tracking of fluctuating fields benefits from measurement-induced spin squeezing and that quantum limits dictated by decoherence are within reach of today's experiments. We illustrate this quantum advantage by single-shot tracking, within the coherence time of a spin-precession magnetometer, of a magnetocardiography signal overlain with broadband noise.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</p>

            <p>High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of collisions and the formation of subsequent many-particle states. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 104 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 5,589 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. An outgoing heavy particle produced in the collision is identified from the skewness of the measured energy density. Integral to this computation is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqi Tong, H. Alaeian, F. Robicheaux</p>
            <p>We study the steady-state behavior of the open Dicke model, which describes the collective interaction of $N$ spin-$1/2$ particles with a lossy, quantized cavity mode and exhibits a superradiant phase transition above a critical light-matter coupling. While the standard model conserves total spin, Kirton and Keeling \cite{PhysRevLett.118.123602} demonstrated that even infinitesimal homogeneous local dephasing destroys this phase transition, and that local atomic decay can restore it. We analyze this interplay using degenerate perturbation theory across subspaces of fixed total spin, $S$. For coupling strengths above the threshold, there exists a critical spin value $S_c$ such that the superradiant phase transition occurs only for $S>S_c$. The perturbative approach captures how weak dephasing and decay induce mixing between different $S$-subspaces, yielding a steady-state spin distribution whose width scales as $1/\sqrt{N}$. This framework requires only the first and second moments and can be implemented via different methods that can yield these two moments (for example, the 2nd-cumulant approach), circumventing the need for full density matrix calculations. These results bridge the quantum Rabi model and Dicke physics, elucidate the roles of dephasing and decay in collective quantum effects, and apply broadly to open quantum systems with degenerate steady states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rizwan Abbas, Ali Raza Mirza, Adam Zaman Chaudhry</p>
            <p>Quantum sensors allow us to measure weak oscillating fields with incredible precision. One common approach is to use the time evolution of a single two-level system (or a qubit) in conjunction with applied control pulses to measure the oscillating field. For high-frequency fields, the time interval required between the applied pulses decreases, meaning that errors due to the finite width of the pulses can become important. This paper presents an alternative scheme that does not rely on applying pulses with short time intervals. Our scheme uses two interacting qubits. In the presence of an oscillating field, the interaction strength changes. The oscillating field can be estimated by measuring the change in this interaction strength. We quantify the precision of this estimate by calculating the Fisher information. We show the effect of noise on our scheme and discuss how control pulses can be applied to mitigate the impact of noise. Importantly, the time interval between these pulses need not be very short.</p>

            <p>In quantum logic spectroscopy, internal transitions of trapped ions and molecules can be probed by measuring the motional displacement caused by an applied light field of variable frequency. This provides a solution to ``needle in a haystack'' problems, such as the search for narrow clock transitions in highly charged ions, recently discussed by S. Chen et al. (Phys. Rev. Applied 22, 054059). The main bottleneck is the search speed over a frequency bandwitdh, which can be increased by enhancing the sensitivity of displacement detection. In this work, we explore two complementary improvements: the use of squeezed motional states and optimal statistical postprocessing of data using a hypothesis testing framework. We demonstrate that each method independently provides a substantial boost to search speed. Their combination effectively mitigates state preparation and measurement errors, improving the search speed by an order of magnitude and fully leveraging the quantum enhancement offered by squeezing.</p>

            <p>The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models. We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$). A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions. Simple two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions. Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables. For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations. For the correlation function one finds the Lorentz-invariant Feynman propagator of quantum field theory. Furthermore, these automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution. PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions. For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.</p>

In its quantum extension -- quantum reservoir computing (QRC) -- these principles are applied to quantum systems, whose rich dynamics broadens the landscape of information processing. In classical RC, optimal performance is typically achieved at the ``edge of chaos," the boundary between order and chaos. Here, we identify its quantum many-body counterpart using the QRC implemented on the celebrated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our analysis reveals substantial performance enhancements near two distinct characteristic ``edges": a temporal boundary defined by the Thouless time, beyond which system dynamics is described by random matrix theory, and a parametric boundary governing the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes. These findings establish the ``edge of many-body quantum chaos" as a design guideline for QRC.</p>

            <p>We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum sensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local phase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a spin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight vector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using parameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global rotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher Information (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the optimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all qubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding where a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized probe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated by the encoding structure.

            <p>We study algorithmic error mitigation via Richardson-style extrapolation for quantum simulations of open quantum systems modelled by the Lindblad equation. Focusing on two specific first-order quantum algorithms, we perform a backward-error analysis to obtain a step-size expansion of the density operator with explicit coefficient bounds. These bounds supply the necessary smoothness for analyzing Richardson extrapolation, allowing us to bound both the deterministic bias and the shot-noise variance that arise in post-processing. For a Lindblad dynamics with generator bounded by $l$, our main theorem shows that an $n=\Omega (\log(1/\varepsilon))$-point extrapolator reduces the maximum circuit depth needed for accuracy $\varepsilon$ from polynomial $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2}/\varepsilon)$ to polylogarithmic $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2} \log l \log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ scaling, an exponential improvement in~$1/\varepsilon$, while keeping sampling complexity to the standard $1/\varepsilon^2$ level, thus extending such results for Hamiltonian simulations to Lindblad simulations.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Achraf Khoudiri, Khadija El Anouz, Abderrahim El Allati</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of entanglement generation in an external quantum system via interaction with a quantum autonomous thermal machine (QATM) under non-Markovian dynamics. The QATM, composed of two qubits each coupled to independent thermal reservoirs, interacts with an external system of two additional qubits. By analyzing the Hilbert space structure, energy level configurations, and temperature gradients, we define a common interaction between the QATM qubits and the external system qubits, which allows the definition of two thermodynamic cycles (A and B) governed by virtual temperatures and energy-conserving transitions. We demonstrate that the QATM can act as a structured reservoir capable of inducing non-Markovian memory effects, as highlighted by negative entropy production rates. Using mutual information and concurrence, we show that entanglement is generated only under cycle A, which is associated with stronger non-Markovian behavior and higher coherence correlations. Our results demonstrate that temperature differences, Hilbert space structure, and coherence serve as quantum resources for controlling and enhancing entanglement in quantum thermodynamic settings, with parameters consistent with experimental superconducting qubit platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Potential from the Material Derivative of the Osmotic Velocity: A Two-Fluid Madelung Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lachezar Simeonov</p>
            <p>We derive the quantum potential directly from the material derivative of the osmotic velocity and formulate a two-fluid model that reproduces the Madelung equations. Interactions between the fluids are included but remain secondary. The framework is generalized to incorporate electromagnetic fields, yielding self-consistent description of both the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations. Extenstion to the relativistic Klein-Gordon case demonstrates the model's flexibility and applicability to spinless relativistic quantum systems. This approach unifies hydrodynamic, kinematic, and electromagnetic perspectives, providing a clear physical interpretation of quantum potentials and forces and offering a versatile platform for modeling complex quantum systems in both non-relativistic and relativistic regimes.</p>

            <h2>Ion-Based Characterization of Laser Beam Profiles for Quantum Information Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilyoung Jung, Frank G. Schroer, Philip Richerme</p>
            <p>Laser-driven operations are a common approach for engineering one- and two-qubit gates in trapped-ion arrays. Measuring key parameters of these lasers, such as beam sizes, intensities, and polarizations, is central to predicting and optimizing gate speeds and stability. Unfortunately, it is challenging to accurately measure these properties at the ion location within an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors. Our approach demonstrates the capability of trapped ions to probe their local environments and to provide useful feedback for improving system performance.</p>

            <h2>Correcting quantum errors using a classical code and one additional qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tenzan Araki, Joseph F. Goodwin, Zhenyu Cai</p>
            <p>Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates. Through classical post-processing, H-VEC virtually filters the error channel, projecting the noise into pure Y-type errors that are subsequently corrected using the classical code's native decoding algorithm. We demonstrate this by applying H-VEC to the classical repetition code. Under a code-capacity noise model, the resulting protocol not only provides full quantum protection but also achieves an exponentially stronger error suppression (in distance) than the original classical code. The improvements over the surface code are even more pronounced, while using far fewer qubits, simpler checks, and straightforward decoding. There are some limitations to the technique, most notably that H-VEC introduces a sampling overhead due to its post-processing nature. Nonetheless, it represents a fundamentally novel hybrid quantum error correction and mitigation framework that redefines the trade-offs between physical hardware requirements and classical processing for error suppression.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujay Mondal, Siddhartha Dutta, Abhijit Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>Classical simulation of open quantum system dynamics remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, the need to accurately capture dissipation and decoherence, and the added complexity of memory effects in the non-Markovian regime. We develop an efficient algorithm for simulating both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in large one-dimensional quantum systems. Extending the Tensor Jump Method, which combines TDVP-based tensor-network evolution with a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of stochastic trajectories, our approach incorporates time-dependent decay rates-treating positive rates as time-inhomogeneous Markovian processes and negative rates via the Influence Martingale formalism to unravel time-local non-Markovian dynamics. This resource-efficient framework enables scalable simulations of open-system dynamics in the non-Markovian regime, as demonstrated for a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain comprising up to 100 spin qubits.</p>

            <p>Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongshun Yao, Jingu Xie, Xuanqiang Zhao, Chengkai Zhu, Ranyiliu Chen, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Monogamy of entanglement, which limits how entanglement can be shared among multiple parties, is a fundamental feature underpinning the privacy of quantum communication. In this work, we introduce a novel operational framework to quantify the unshareability or unextendibility of entanglement via a virtual state-extension task. The virtual extension cost is defined as the minimum simulation cost of a randomized protocol that reproduces the marginals of a $k$-extension. For the important family of isotropic states, we derive an exact closed-form expression for this cost. Our central result establishes a tight connection: the virtual extension cost of a maximally entangled state equals the optimal simulation cost of universal virtual quantum broadcasting. Using the algebra of partially transposed permutation matrices, we obtain an analytical formula and construct an explicit quantum circuit for the optimal broadcasting protocol, thereby resolving an open question in quantum broadcasting. We further relate the virtual extension cost to the absolute robustness of unextendibility, providing it with a clear operational meaning, and show that the virtual extension cost is an entanglement measure that bounds distillable entanglement and connects to logarithmic negativity.</p>

Three variants are introduced, matching different hardware maturity levels: (I) a theoretical local-detuning approach; (II) a Detuning Map Modulation (DMM) method bridging theory and near-term feasibility; and (III) a global-pulse implementation suitable for current QPUs. All were evaluated on Pasqal's emulators for graphs up to 30 qubits, demonstrating realistic, transferable performance within present-day hardware limits.</p>

            <h2>Protein-Based Electrical Junctions with Robust Biocompatible Carbon Electrodes Exhibit Activation-less Charge Transport down to 10 K</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shailendra K. Saxena, Sudipta Bera, Tatyana Bendikov, Israel Pecht, Mordechai Sheves, David Cahen</p>
            <p>The integration of functional proteins into solid-state electronic devices remains a central challenge in molecular bioelectronics due to the fragile nature of protein structures and their complex charge-transport behaviour. Here, we present a robust crosswire evaporated top-contact device based on bacteriorhodopsin (bR) single bilayers (SBL), configured as Au/Cys/bR(SBL)/eC/Au (simplified as Au/bR/eC). The evaporated carbon (eC) top electrode forms a conformal, non-invasive contact that suppresses filament formation and ensures electrical integrity across the cross-wire intersecting area (about 200 micron^2). Structural and spectroscopic analyses confirm that the solid-state bR films maintain the native absorption spectrum and have functional photocycle activity after electrode deposition, implying that their native conformation is not significantly affected. Remarkably, electron transport (ETp) through the 9 nm bR-SBL junctions is temperature-independent within 300 K - 10 K, excluding thermally activated hopping, while the length is incompatible with coherent tunneling. Under green illumination, the junctions exhibit a reversible, photo-induced current enhancement (Jgreen/Jdark = 2), ascribed to light-driven conformational changes rather than direct photoexcitation. The Au/bR/eC architecture thus establishes a thermally non-activated, conformationally mediated transport mechanism via a stable, cryo-compatible solid-state protein junction. This work provides a scalable platform for integrating light-responsive biomolecules into future bio-optoelectronic and neuromorphic devices.</p>

            <h2>Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Corbett, Akimasa Miyake</p>
            <p>Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.</p>

            <p>We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</p>

            <p>Thermoelectricity is generally understood as a classical effect emerging from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. Here we uncover a purely quantum mechanism, where a superconducting S-I-S' tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium develops a nonlinear bipolar thermoelectric response owing to the dynamical Coulomb blockade and the emission-absorption imbalance of a cold electromagnetic bath. Two representative environments are analysed, revealing Seebeck coefficients up to 100 $\mu$V/K for realistic junction parameters. Because the response directly reflects the spectral properties of the surrounding environment, our results suggest that bipolar quantum thermoelectricity could provide a new route for spectroscopic sensing of electromagnetic modes and for designing low-temperature thermoelectric devices with environmentally engineered performance.</p>

            <p>To evaluate a quantum circuit on a quantum processor, one must find a mapping from circuit qubits to processor qubits and plan the instruction execution while satisfying the processor's constraints. This is known as the qubit mapping and routing (QMR) problem. High-quality QMR solutions are key to maximizing the utility of scarce quantum resources and minimizing the probability of logical errors affecting computation. The challenge is that the landscape of quantum processors is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving. Given this diversity, dozens of papers have addressed the QMR problem for different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error correction schemes by a developing a new algorithm for a particular context. We present an alternative approach: automatically generating qubit mapping and routing compilers for arbitrary quantum processors. Though each QMR problem is different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a compact domain-specific language for specifying QMR problems and a powerful parametric algorithm that can be instantiated for any QMR specification. Our thorough evaluation on case studies of important QMR problems shows that generated compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oriel Kiss, Ivano Tavernelli, Francesco Tacchino, Denis Lacroix, Alessandro Roggero</p>
            <p>The dynamical evolution of neutrino flavor in supernovae can be modeled by an all-to-all spin Hamiltonian with random couplings. Simulating such two-local Hamiltonian dynamics remains a major challenge, as methods with controllable accuracy require circuit depths that increase at least linearly with system size, exceeding the capabilities of current quantum devices. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis predicts that these systems should thermalize, a behavior confirmed in small-scale classical simulations. In this work, we investigate flavor thermalization in much larger systems using random quantum circuits as an empirical tool to emulate the non-local dynamics, and demonstrate that the thermal behavior can be reproduced using a depth independent of the system size. By simulating dynamics of over one hundred qubits, we find that the thermalization time grows approximately as the square root of the system size, consistent with predictions from semi-classical methods. Beyond this specific result, our study illustrates that near-term quantum devices are useful tools to test and validate empirical classical methods. It also highlights a new application of random circuits in physics, providing insight into complex many-body dynamics that are classically intractable.</p>

Controlled implantation and annealing experiments confirm that the ClV centers originate specifically from chlorine incorporation into SiC and are not intrinsic to this material. We optimize the creation conditions for ClV ensembles and demonstrate negligible reduction of the ZPL intensity up to a temperature of 30 K.

Unlike the conventional Caldeira-Leggett model with linear system-bath coupling $H_{\mathrm{SB}}\propto\hat F$, the PCL model features an exponential interaction $H_{\mathrm{SB}}\propto e^{i\lambda \hat F}$, where $\hat F$ denotes the collective bath coordinate. This model unifies concepts from quantum Brownian motion and polaron physics, providing a general platform to study phase-mediated dissipation and decoherence beyond the linear-response regime. Despite its nonlinear system-bath coupling, the Gaussian nature of the environment allows a nonperturbative and non-Markovian treatment of PCL model within the algebra of dissipative quasiparticles. We obtain an exact closed-form equation of motion for the reduced density operator, and numerical simulations reveal distinctive dynamical behaviors that deviate markedly from those predicted by the conventional Caldeira-Leggett model.</p>

By providing an efficient light-matter interface within a compact architecture, they serve as highly efficient quantum nodes with strong potential for scalable quantum network.

These challenges significantly hinder the practical implementation of ion trap systems integrated with micro-cavities. To overcome these limitations, we present the design and fabrication of metal-shielded micro-cavity mirrors, enabling the stable realization of ion trap systems integrated with micro cavities. Using this method, we constructed a needle ion trap integrated with fiber Fabry-Perot cavity and successfully achieved stable trapping of a single ion within the cavity. The measured ion heating rate was reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with unshielded configurations.

Here we exploit the spatial structure of atomic ensembles to control the coupling between modes of distinct cavities, thereby reshaping the resulting atom-photon spectra.

This leads to mode-mode spectral subsplittings, where collectivity arises not only from the atom number but also from the ability to tune modes of different cavities independently. Our results establish spatially engineered atomic ensembles as a pathway to selective photon transfer between modes and precise control of many-body complexity.</p>

            <p>Exploring gravitational interactions between objects with small masses has become increasingly timely. Concurrently, oscillators with masses ranging between milligrams and grams in cavity optomechanical systems sparked interest for probing gravity, and even investigating gravity within macroscopic quantum systems. Here we present a measurement scheme for probing gravity in a microwave optomechanical setup that incorporates periodic gravitational modulation between the test mass and the driven source mass at the milligram scale. Optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) can be utilized to sense the gravitational interactions between test masses and source masses. Specifically, the relative variation in the height of the OMIT peak, expressed as $|1 + re^{i\phi}|^2 - 1$, where $r$ represents the ratio of the amplitude of the gravitational driving force to the radiation pressure force of the probe tone, and $\phi$ denotes their phase difference, can reach up to 2.3\% under plausible experimental conditions.

            <p>We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\gamma<\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</p>
