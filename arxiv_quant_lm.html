            <h2>Block encoding with low gate count for second-quantized Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diyi Liu, Shuchen Zhu, Guang Hao Low, Lin Lin, Chao Yang</p>
            <p>Efficient block encoding of many-body Hamiltonians is a central requirement for quantum algorithms in scientific computing, particularly in the early fault-tolerant era. In this work, we introduce new explicit constructions for block encoding second-quantized Hamiltonians that substantially reduce Clifford+T gate complexity and ancilla overhead. By utilizing a data lookup strategy based on the SWAP architecture for the sparsity oracle $O_C$, and a direct sampling method for the amplitude oracle $O_A$ with SELECT-SWAP architecture, we achieve a T count that scales as $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{L})$ with respect to the number of interaction terms $L$ in general second-quantized Hamiltonians. We also achieve an improved constant factor in the Clifford gate count of our oracle. Furthermore, we design a block encoding that directly targets the $\eta$-particle subspace, thereby reducing the subnormalization factor from $\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$, and improving fault-tolerant efficiency when simulating systems with fixed particle numbers. Building on the block encoding framework developed for general many-body Hamiltonians, we extend our approach to electronic Hamiltonians whose coefficient tensors exhibit translation invariance or possess decaying structures. Our results provide a practical path toward early fault-tolerant quantum simulation of many-body systems, substantially lowering resource overheads compared to previous methods.</p>

            <h2>Single-shot conditional displacement gate between a trapped atom and traveling light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Kikura, Hayato Goto, Fumiya Hanamura, Takao Aoki</p>
            <p>We propose a single-shot conditional displacement gate between a trapped atom as the control qubit and a traveling light pulse as the target oscillator, mediated by an optical cavity. Classical driving of the atom synchronized with the light reflection off the cavity realizes the single-shot implementation of the crucial gate for the universal control of hybrid systems. We further derive a concise gate model incorporating cavity loss and atomic decay, facilitating the evaluation and optimization of the gate performance. This proposal establishes a key practical tool for coherently linking stationary atoms with itinerant light, a capability essential for realizing hybrid quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Statistical Benchmarking of Optimization Methods for Variational Quantum Eigensolver under Quantum Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvie Illésová, Tomáš Bezděk, Vojtěch Novák, Bruno Senjean, Martin Beseda</p>
            <p>This work investigates the performance of numerical optimization algorithms applied to the State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver for the H2 molecule under various quantum noise conditions. The goal is to assess the stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency of commonly used gradient-based, gradient-free, and global optimization strategies within the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum regime. We systematically compare six representative optimizers, BFGS, SLSQP, Nelder-Mead, Powell, COBYLA, and iSOMA,under ideal, stochastic, and decoherence noise models, including phase damping, depolarizing, and thermal relaxation channels. Each optimizer was tested over multiple noise intensities and measurement settings to characterize convergence behavior and sensitivity to noise-induced landscape distortions. The results show that BFGS consistently achieves the most accurate energies with minimal evaluations, maintaining robustness even under moderate decoherence. COBYLA performs well for low-cost approximations, while SLSQP exhibits instability in noisy regimes. Global approaches such as iSOMA show potential but are computationally expensive. These findings provide practical guidance for selecting suitable optimizers in variational quantum simulations, highlighting the importance of noise-aware optimization strategies for reliable and efficient quantum chemistry computations on current hardware.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting higher-order correlation functions for photon-statistics-based characterization and reconstruction of arbitrary Gaussian states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Heinzel, René Sondenheimer</p>
            <p>Gaussian states are an essential building block for various applications in quantum optics and quantum information science, yet the precise relation between their second- and third-order correlation functions remains not fully explored. We discuss connections between these correlation functions by constructing an explicit decomposition formula for arbitrary sixth-order moments of ladder operators for general Gaussian states and demonstrate how the derived relations enable state classification from correlation data alone. Whereas violating these relations certifies non-Gaussianity, satisfying them provides evidence for a Gaussian-state description and allows a direct distinction among non-displaced, non-squeezed, and displaced-squeezed sectors of the Gaussian state space. Further, we show that it is not possible to uniquely extract state parameters solely from correlation-function measurements without prior assumptions about the Gaussian state. Resolving this ambiguity requires additional loss-sensitive information, e.g., measuring the mean intensity or the vacuum overlap of each mode. In particular, we show under which circumstances these measurements can be used to reconstruct a generic Gaussian state.</p>

            <h2>Entangled Photon Pair Generator via Biexciton-Exciton Cascade in Semiconductor Quantum Dots and its Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Sekavčnik, Paul Kohl, Janis Nötzel</p>
            <p>The generation of entangled photon pairs is highly useful for many types of quantum technologies. In this work an entangled photon pair generator that utilises the biexciton-exciton cascade in semiconductor quantum dots is described on a physical, mathematical, and software level. The system is implemented and simulated as a self-contained component in a framework for bigger quantum optical experiments. Thus, it is a description to further the holistic understanding of the system for interdisciplinary audiences in a hopefully simple yet sufficient manner. It is described from the condensed matter physics fundamentals, over the most important quantum optical properties, to a mathematical description of the used model, and finally a software description and simulation, making it an executable description of such a system.</p>

            <h2>Chern insulators and topological flat bands in cavity-embedded kagome systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hikaru Goto, Ryo Okugawa, Takami Tohyama</p>
            <p>We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.</p>

            <h2>Strong coupling between a single-photon and a two-photon Fock state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai-Peng Wang, Alberto Mercurio, Alessandro Ridolfo, Yuqing Wang, Mo Chen, Wenyan Wang, Yulong Liu, Huanying Sun, Tiefu Li, Franco Nori, Salvatore Savasta, J. Q. You</p>
            <p>The realization of strong nonlinear coupling between single photons has been a long-standing goal in quantum optics and quantum information science, promising wide impact applications, such as all-optical deterministic quantum logic and single-photon frequency conversion. Here, we report an experimental observation of the strong coupling between a single-photon and a two-photon Fock state in an ultrastrongly-coupled circuit-QED system. This strong nonlinear interaction is realized by introducing a detuned flux qubit working as an effective coupler between two modes of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The ultrastrong light--matter interaction breaks the excitation number conservation, and an external flux bias breaks the parity conservation. The combined effect of the two enables the strong one--two-photon coupling. Quantum Rabi-like avoided crossing is resolved when tuning the two-photon resonance frequency of the first mode across the single-photon resonance frequency of the second mode. Within this new photonic regime, we observe the thresholdless second harmonic generation for a mean photon number below one. Our results represent a key step towards a new regime of quantum nonlinear optics, where individual photons can deterministically and coherently interact with each other in the absence of any stimulating fields.</p>

            <h2>Vacuum Rabi Splitting and Quantum Fisher Information of a Non-Hermitian Qubit in a Single-Mode Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cheng Wang, Jiong Li, Li-Wei Duan, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigensolutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum are predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a {quantum-criticality-enhanced} effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.</p>

            <h2>Certifying non-classicality and non-Gaussianity through optical parametric amplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Kalash, Marcello H.M. Passos, Éva Rácz, László Ruppert, Radim Filip, Maria V. Chekhova</p>
            <p>Non-Gaussian states of light are essential for numerous quantum information protocols; thus, certifying non-Gaussianity is crucial. Full quantum state tomography, commonly used for this purpose, is a complicated procedure and yields inconclusive results for strongly mixed states. Certifying non-Gaussianity through directly measurable parameters is a simpler alternative, typically achieved by measuring photon-number probabilities - either directly, using photon-number resolving detectors, or through Hanbury Brown--Twiss type measurements with single-photon detectors. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that optical parametric amplification combined with conventional intensity detectors can effectively replace this approach without the need for photon-number resolution. In our method, we measure the mean photon number and the second-order correlation function for the amplified state. Using it, we successfully certify the non-Gaussianity of a heralded quasi-single-photon state. Since optical parametric amplification is a broadband and multimode process, our method provides a foundation for developing high-dimensional quantum technologies utilizing broadband multimode non-Gaussian states.</p>

            <h2>Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhilong Liu, Wentao Liu, Xiaofang Liu, Jieci Wang</p>
            <p>Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>A Hardware-Efficient Mølmer-Sørensen Gate for Superconducting Quantum Computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. AbuGhanem</p>
            <p>The Mølmer-Sørensen gate, a cornerstone entangling operation in trapped-ion systems, represents a promising alternative to standard entangling gates in superconducting quantum architectures. However, its performance on superconducting hardware has remained unverified. In this work, we present a hardware-efficient implementation of the Mølmer-Sørensen gate and characterize its performance using quantum process tomography (QPT) on IBM Quantum's superconducting processors. Our implementation achieves a process fidelity of 92.47\% on the real quantum hardware, a performance competitive with the 93.02\% fidelity of the device's native controlled-NOT (CX) gate. Furthermore, for the $|00\rangle$ input state, the gate prepares the target Bell state with $94.2\%$ success probability, confirming its correct logical operation. These results demonstrate that non-native entangling gates can be optimized to perform on par with hardware-native operations. This work expands the effective gate set for algorithm design on fixed-architecture processors and provides a critical benchmark for cross-platform gate evaluation, underscoring the role of hardware-aware compilation in advancing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing.</p>

            <h2>Proposals for experimentally realizing (mostly) quantum-autonomous gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Antonio Marín Guzmán, Yu-Xin Wang, Tom Manovitz, Paul Erker, Norbert M. Linke, Simone Gasparinetti, Nicole Yunger Halpern</p>
            <p>Autonomous quantum machines (AQMs) execute tasks without requiring time-dependent external control. Motivations for AQMs include the restrictions imposed by classical control on quantum machines' coherence times and geometries. Most AQM work is theoretical and abstract; yet an experiment recently demonstrated AQMs' usefulness in qubit reset, crucial to quantum computing. To further reduce quantum computing's classical control, we propose realizations of (fully and partially) quantum-autonomous gates on three platforms: Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. First, we show that a Rydberg-blockade interaction or an ultrafast transition can quantum-autonomously effect entangling gates on Rydberg atoms. One can perform $Z$ or entangling gates on trapped ions mostly quantum-autonomously, by sculpting a linear Paul trap or leveraging a ring trap. Passive lasers control these gates, as well as the Rydberg-atom gates, quantum-autonomously. Finally, circuit quantum electrodynamics can enable quantum-autonomous $Z$ and $XY$ gates on superconducting qubits. The gates can serve as building blocks for (fully or partially) quantum-autonomous circuits, which may reduce classical-control burdens.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation of chemistry via quantum fast multipole method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominic W. Berry, Kianna Wan, Andrew D. Baczewski, Elliot C. Eklund, Arkin Tikku, Ryan Babbush</p>
            <p>Here we describe an approach for simulating quantum chemistry on quantum computers with significantly lower asymptotic complexity than prior work. The approach uses a real-space first-quantised representation of the molecular Hamiltonian which we propagate using high-order product formulae. Essential for this low complexity is the use of a technique similar to the fast multipole method for computing the Coulomb operator with $\widetilde{\cal O}(\eta)$ complexity for a simulation with $\eta$ particles. We show how to modify this algorithm so that it can be implemented on a quantum computer. We ultimately demonstrate an approach with $t(\eta^{4/3}N^{1/3} + \eta^{1/3} N^{2/3} ) (\eta Nt/\epsilon)^{o(1)}$ gate complexity, where $N$ is the number of grid points, $\epsilon$ is target precision, and $t$ is the duration of time evolution. This is roughly a speedup by ${\cal O}(\eta)$ over most prior algorithms. We provide lower complexity than all prior work for $N<\eta^6$ (the regime of practical interest), with only first-quantised interaction-picture simulations providing better performance for $N>\eta^6$. As with the classical fast multipole method, large numbers $\eta\gtrsim 10^3$ would be needed to realise this advantage.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Resources in Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories: Nonstabilizerness, Multipartite Entanglement, and Fermionic Non-Gaussianity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gopal Chandra Santra, Julius Mildenberger, Edoardo Ballini, Alberto Bottarelli, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) represent one of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation. From a practical implementation perspective, non-Abelian theories present significantly tougher challenges than Abelian LGTs. However, it is unknown whether this is also reflected in increased values of quantum resources relating to the complexity of simulating quantum many-body models. Here, we compare three paradigmatic measures of quantum resources -- stabilizer Rényi entropy, generalized geometric measure of entanglement, and fermionic antiflatness -- for pure-gauge theories on a ladder with Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$ as well as non-Abelian $D_3$ and SU(2) gauge symmetries. We find that non-Abelian symmetries are not necessarily inherently harder to simulate than Abelian ones, but rather the required quantum resources depend nontrivially on the interplay between the group structure, superselection sector, and encoding of the gauge constraints. Our findings help indicate where quantum advantage could emerge in simulations of LGTs, both in NISQ and fault-tolerant eras.</p>

            <h2>Angular Geometry of Atomic Multipole Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wesley C. Campbell</p>
            <p>A simple way to calculate Rabi frequencies is outlined for interactions of atomic or nuclear multipole moments with laser fields that focuses on their relative geometry. The resulting expression takes the form of a dot product between the laser polarization and a vector spherical harmonic, thereby naturally connecting to the multipole's far-field spontaneous-emission pattern and providing a way to visualize the interaction. Since the vector spherical harmonics are not yet a standard tool in quantum science, their relevant properties are reviewed. This approach is illustrated in the calculation of a variety of beam effects, yielding both perturbative corrections and some nontrivial cases with non-vanishing coupling.</p>

            <h2>A quantum state transfer protocol with Ising Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar Michel, Matthias Werner, Arnau Riera</p>
            <p>Quantum state transfer is a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation, where fast and reliable communication between distant spins is essential. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum state transfer in linear spin chains tailored to superconducting flux qubits. Starting from a perfect state transfer scheme via a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous couplings, we adapt it for architectures implementing the transverse-field Ising model by encoding the information in domain walls. The resulting linear Ising chain makes quantum transport experiments accessible to many platforms for analog quantum simulation. We test the protocol for 1-, 2-, and 3- spin states, obtaining high transfer fidelities of up to 0.99 and study the accuracy dependence on the domain wall approximation. These results are the first step in paving the way for an experimental implementation of the protocol.</p>

            <h2>On Quantum Computation Using Bias-Preserving Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debadrito Roy, Aryaman Manish Kolhe, V. Lalitha, Navin Kashyap</p>
            <p>Certain types of quantum computing platforms, such as those realized using Rydberg atoms or Kerr-cat qubits, are natively more susceptible to Pauli-Z noise than Pauli-X noise, or vice versa. On such hardware, it is useful to ensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in the noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for biased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms. In this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj Quantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving gates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a linear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving gate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set {X,R_z(\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \theta is any irrational multiple of 2\pi. (3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any Z-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving gates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that Z-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Reconfigurable dissipative entanglement between many spin ensembles: from robust quantum sensing to many-body state engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anjun Chu, Mikhail Mamaev, Martin Koppenhöfer, Ming Yuan, Aashish A. Clerk</p>
            <p>An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.</p>

            <h2>Generating Entangled Steady States in Multistable Open Quantum Systems via Initial State Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Fallas Padilla, Raphael Kaubruegger, Adrianna Gillman, Stephen Becker, Ana Maria Rey</p>
            <p>Entanglement underpins the power of quantum technologies, yet it is fragile and typically destroyed by dissipation. Paradoxically, the same dissipation, when carefully engineered, can drive a system toward robust entangled steady states. However, this engineering task is nontrivial, as dissipative many-body systems are complex, particularly when they support multiple steady states. Here, we derive analytic expressions that predict how the steady state of a system evolving under a Lindblad equation depends on the initial state, without requiring integration of the dynamics. These results extend the frameworks developed in Refs. [Phys. Rev. A 89, 022118 (2014) and Phys. Rev. X 6, 041031 (2016)], showing that while the steady-state manifold is determined by the Liouvillian kernel, the weights within it depend on both the Liouvillian and the initial state. We identify a special class of Liouvillians for which the steady state depends only on the initial overlap with the kernel. Our framework provides analytical insight and a computationally efficient tool for predicting steady states in open quantum systems. As an application, we propose schemes to generate metrologically useful entangled steady states in spin ensembles via balanced collective decay.</p>

            <h2>Optimal lower bounds for quantum state tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thilo Scharnhorst, Jack Spilecki, John Wright</p>
            <p>We show that $n = \Omega(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary to learn a rank $r$ mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ up to error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance. This matches the upper bound of $n = O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ from prior work, and therefore settles the sample complexity of mixed state tomography. We prove this lower bound by studying a special case of full state tomography that we refer to as projector tomography, in which $\rho$ is promised to be of the form $\rho = P/r$, where $P \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is a rank $r$ projector. A key technical ingredient in our proof, which may be of independent interest, is a reduction which converts any algorithm for projector tomography which learns to error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance to an algorithm which learns to error $O(\varepsilon)$ in the more stringent Bures distance.</p>

            <h2>Speed limits of two-qutrit gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bora Basyildiz, Zhexuan Gong, Sahel Ashhab</p>
            <p>The speed of elementary quantum gates sets a limit on the speed at which quantum circuits can be applied and, as a result, the size of the computations that can be performed on a quantum computer. This limitation stems from the fact that present-day quantum hardware systems have finite coherence times that limit the total computation time. The speeds of qubit gates in various hardware settings have been well studied over the past few decades. The recent interest in multi-level quantum systems naturally creates a need for similar investigations of the speeds of multi-level or qudit gates. In this work, we perform an empirical study of the speed limit for the three-level or qutrit CZ gate. Our analysis focuses on a theoretical model for capacitively coupled superconducting transmons but can be extended to other systems. We generate CZ gate protocols using optimal control theory techniques and observe when the fidelity crosses certain thresholds. In addition to the empirical approach, we derive an analytical speed limit for the qutrit CZ gate using traditional quantum speed limit techniques. We compare the speed limits derived using these two different approaches and discuss the gap that remains between them. We also compare the time needed to implement the qutrit CZ gate with its qubit counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Balanced ternary formalism of second quantization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yao Yao</p>
            <p>We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and quantum simulations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Tanner Color Codes on Qubits with Transversal Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle Gulshen, Tali Kaufman</p>
            <p>This work focuses on growing our understanding of how high dimensional expanders (HDX) can be utilized to construct highly performant quantum codes. While asymptotically good qLDPC codes have been constructed on 2D HDX built from products of graphs, these constructions have a number of limitations, like lack of structure useful for fault-tolerant logic. We develop a framework for transversal logical gates that can naturally utilize symmetric non-product simplicial HDX, and we demonstrate a particular code in this framework that offers various advantages over prior constructions. Specifically, we study the generalization of color codes to \emph{Tanner color codes}, which encompass color, pin, and rainbow codes, and should enable constructions with better parameters. We prove an `unfolding' theorem that characterizes the logical operators of the Tanner color code in terms of logical operators from several colored copies of the companion sheaf code. We leverage this understanding of the logical operators to identify a local condition that ensures such a code on a $D$-dimensional complex has a strictly-transversal $\frac{2 \pi}{2^D}$-phase gate on a single block, $\frac{2 \pi}{2^\ell}$-phase gates on subsets of a single block for $\ell<D$, and $C^{D-1}Z$ across $D$ blocks that preserve the code space. We explicitly instantiate our paradigm in every dimension with codes on highly-symmetric expanding coset complexes. These are the first qubit codes explicitly defined on expanding (non-product) simplicial complexes. We investigate in detail the self-dual 2D family, which has large rate $\geq \frac{7}{64}$ and transversal $CZ$, $S$, and $H$ gates, among many other fault-tolerant (generalizations of) fold-transversal gates arising from the symmetry of the complex. We conjecture that it has constant relative distance. We conclude by describing a Floquet variant of this code with check weight 4.</p>

            <h2>A Feasible Quantum Walk-Enabled Blockchain with Quantum Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chong-Qiang Ye, Heng-Ji Li, Jian Li, Xiao-Yu Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum blockchains provide inherent resilience against quantum adversaries and represent a promising alternative to classical blockchain systems in the quantum era. However, existing quantum blockchain architectures largely depend on entanglement to maintain inter-block connections, facing challenges in stability, consensus efficiency, and system verification. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel quantum blockchain framework based on quantum walks, which reduces reliance on entanglement while improving stability and connection efficiency. We further propose a quantum consensus mechanism based on a weighted quantum voting protocol, which enables a fairer voting process while reflecting the weights of different nodes. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct circuit simulations to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of both the quantum walk-based block construction and the quantum voting consensus mechanism. Compared with existing entanglement-dependent approaches, our framework achieves stronger stability and enables simpler verification of block integrity, making it a practical candidate for quantum-era blockchain applications.</p>

            <p>The gravitational fields of astrophysical bodies bend the light around them, creating multiple paths along which light from a distant source can arrive at Earth. Measuring the difference in photon arrival time along these different paths provides a means of determining the mass of the lensing system, which is otherwise difficult to constrain. This is particularly challenging in the case of microlensing, where the images produced by lensing cannot be individually resolved; existing proposals for detecting time delays in microlensed systems are significantly constrained due to the need for large photon flux and the loss of signal coherence when the angular diameter of the light source becomes too large. In this work, we propose a novel approach to measuring astrophysical time delays. Our method uses exponentially fewer photons than previous schemes, enabling observations that would otherwise be impossible. Our approach, which combines a quantum-inspired algorithm and quantum information processing technologies, saturates a provable lower bound on the number of photons required to find the time delay. Our scheme has multiple applications: we explore its use both in calibrating optical interferometric telescopes and in making direct mass measurements of ongoing microlensing events. To demonstrate the latter, we present a fiducial example of microlensed stellar flares sources in the Galactic Bulge. Though the number of photons produced by such events is small, we show that our photon-efficient scheme opens the possibility of directly measuring microlensing time delays using existing and near-future ground-based telescopes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Schmidhuber, Jonathan Z. Lu, Noah Shutty, Stephen Jordan, Alexander Poremba, Yihui Quek</p>
            <p>We introduce Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI), a quantum algorithm that utilizes coherent Bell measurements and the symplectic representation of the Pauli group to reduce Gibbs sampling and Hamiltonian optimization to classical decoding. For a signed Pauli Hamiltonian $H$ and any degree-$\ell$ polynomial ${P}$, HDQI prepares a purification of the density matrix $\rho_{P}(H) \propto {P}^2(H)$ by solving a combination of two tasks: decoding $\ell$ errors on a classical code defined by $H$, and preparing a pilot state that encodes the anti-commutation structure of $H$. Choosing $P(x)$ to approximate $\exp(-\beta x/2)$ yields Gibbs states at inverse temperature $\beta$; other choices prepare approximate ground states, microcanonical ensembles, and other spectral filters. For local Hamiltonians, the corresponding decoding problem is that of LDPC codes. Preparing the pilot state is always efficient for commuting Hamiltonians, but highly non-trivial for non-commuting Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, we prove that this state admits an efficient matrix product state representation for Hamiltonians whose anti-commutation graph decomposes into connected components of logarithmic size. We show that HDQI efficiently prepares Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures for a class of physically motivated commuting Hamiltonians -- including the toric code and Haah's cubic code -- but we also develop a matching efficient classical algorithm for this task. For a non-commuting semiclassical spin glass and commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians with quantum defects, HDQI prepares Gibbs states up to a constant inverse-temperature threshold using polynomial quantum resources and quasi-polynomial classical pre-processing. These results position HDQI as a versatile algorithmic primitive and the first extension of Regev's reduction to non-abelian groups.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junpeng Hu, Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Lei Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum computing holds significant promise for scientific computing due to its potential for polynomial to even exponential speedups over classical methods, which are often hindered by the curse of dimensionality. While neural networks present a mesh-free alternative to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), their accuracy is difficult to achieve since one needs to solve a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using the stochastic gradient descent method and its variants, the convergence of which is difficult to prove and cannot be guaranteed. The classical random feature method (RFM) effectively merges advantages from both classical numerical analysis and neural network based techniques, achieving spectral accuracy and a natural adaptability to complex geometries. In this work, we introduce a quantum random feature method (QRFM) that leverages quantum computing to accelerate the classical RFM framework. Our method constructs PDE solutions using quantum-generated random features and enforces the governing equations via a collocation approach. A complexity analysis demonstrates that this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup over the classical RFM.</p>

To address this problem, we introduce the notion of minimax channel divergence and establish several of its key mathematical properties. We prove the Stein's lemma in this new setting, showing that the optimal type-II error exponent in the asymptotic regime under parallel strategies is characterized by the regularized minimax channel divergence.</p>

            <p>We unconditionally prove that it is NP-hard to compute a constant multiplicative approximation to the QUANTUM MAX-CUT problem on an unweighted graph of constant bounded degree. The proof works in two stages: first we demonstrate a generic reduction to computing the optimal value of a quantum problem, from the optimal value over product states. Then we prove an approximation preserving reduction from MAX-CUT to PRODUCT-QMC the product state version of QUANTUM MAX-CUT. More precisely, in the second part, we construct a PTAS reduction from MAX-CUT$_k$ (the rank-k constrained version of MAX-CUT) to MAX-CUT$_{k+1}$, where MAX-CUT and PRODUCT-QMC coincide with MAX-CUT$_1$ and MAX-CUT$_3$ respectively. We thus prove that Max-Cut$_k$ is APX-complete for all constant $k$.</p>

Given a valid output of $\hat{O}$, the corresponding unoperation produces a set of all valid inputs to $\hat{O}$ that produce the given output. Further, the working principle of unoperations is illustrated using the example of addition. A device providing that functionality is constructed utilising a quantum circuit performing the unoperation of addition - referred to as unaddition. To highlight the potential of the approach the unaddition quantum circuit is employed to construct a device for factoring integer numbers $N$, which is then called unmultiplier. This approach requires only a number of qubits $\in \mathcal{O}((\log{N})^2)$, rivalling the best known factoring algorithms to date.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Lake</p>
            <p>We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <h2>Optimization of Quadratic Constraints by Decoded Quantum Interferometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Cohen Hillel</p>
            <p>A recent paper by Jordan et al. introduced Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), a novel quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce linear optimization problems -- max-XORSAT and max-LINSAT -- to decoding problems. In this paper, we extend DQI to optimization problems involving quadratic constraints, which we call max-QUADSAT. Leveraging a connection to quadratic Gauss sums, we give an efficient algorithm to prepare the DQI state for max-QUADSAT. To demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a quantum advantage, we introduce the Quadratic Optimal Polynomial Intersection (quadratic-OPI) problem, a restricted variant of OPI for which, to our knowledge, the standard DQI framework offers no algorithmic speedup. We show that quadratic-OPI is an instance of max-QUADSAT and use our algorithm to optimize it. Lastly, we present a new generalized proof of the "semicircle law" for the fraction of satisfied constraints, generalizing it to any DQI state of problems where the distribution of the number of satisfied constraints for a random assignment is sufficiently close to a binomial distribution. This condition holds exactly for the DQI state of max-LINSAT, and approximately holds in the max-QUADSAT case, with the approximation becoming exponentially better as the problem size increases. This establishes performance guarantees for our algorithm.</p>

            <p>Learning properties of quantum states from measurement data is a fundamental challenge in quantum information. The sample complexity of such tasks depends crucially on the measurement primitive. While shadow tomography achieves sample-efficient learning by allowing entangling measurements across many copies, it requires prohibitively deep circuits. At the other extreme, two-copy measurements already yield exponential advantages over single-copy strategies in tasks such as Pauli tomography. In this work we show that such sharp separations extend far beyond the two-copy regime: for every prime c we construct explicit learning tasks of degree c, which are exponentially hard with (c - 1)-copy measurements but efficiently solvable with c-copy measurements. Our protocols are not only sample-efficient but also realizable with shallow circuits. Extending further, we show that such finite-degree tasks exist for all square-free integers c, pointing toward a general principle underlying their existence. Together, our results reveal an infinite hierarchy of multi-copy learning problems, uncovering new phase transitions in sample complexity and underscoring the role of reliable quantum memory as a key resource for exponential quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>Secure key leasing allows a cryptographic key to be leased as a quantum state in such a way that the key can later be revoked in a verifiable manner. In this work, we propose a modular framework for constructing secure key leasing with a classical-lessor, where the lessor is entirely classical and, in particular, the quantum secret key can be both leased and revoked using only classical communication. Based on this framework, we obtain classical-lessor secure key leasing schemes for public-key encryption (PKE), pseudorandom function (PRF), and digital signature. We adopt the strong security notion known as security against verification key revealing attacks (VRA security) proposed by Kitagawa et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) into the classical-lessor setting, and we prove that all three of our schemes satisfy this notion under the learning with errors assumption. Our PKE scheme improves upon the previous construction by Goyal et al. (Eurocrypt 2025), and our PRF and digital signature schemes are respectively the first PRF and digital signature with classical-lessor secure key leasing property.</p>

            <h2>On the modeling of irreversibility by relaxator Liouville dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janos Hajdu, Martin Janßen</p>
            <p>A general approach to modeling irreversibility starting from microscopic reversibility is presented. The time $t_s$ up to which relevant degrees of freedom of a system are tracked is extremely much shorter than the spectral resolution time $t_e$ that would be necessary to resolve the spectrum of all degrees of freedom involved. A relaxator that breaks reversibility condenses in the Liouville operator of the relevant degrees of freedom. The irrelevant degrees of freedom act as an environment to the system. The irreversible relaxator Liouville equation contains memory effects and initial correlations of all degrees of freedom. Stationary states turn out to be generically unique and independent of the initial conditions and exceptions are due to degeneracies. Equilibrium states lie in the relaxator's kernel yielding a stationary Pauli master equation. Kinetic equations for oneparticle densities are constructed as special cases of relaxator Liouville dynamics. Kubo's linear response theory is generalized to relaxator Liouville dynamics and related to irreversibility within the system. In a weak coupling approximation between system and environment the relaxator can be reduced to environmental correlations and bilinear system operators. Markov approximation turns the relaxator Liouville dynamics into a semi-group dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Algorithm for Low Energy Effective Hamiltonian and Quasi-Degenerate Eigenvalue Problem</h2>

            <p>Quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems are central to quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics, where low-energy spectra often form manifolds of nearly degenerate states that determine physical properties. Standard quantum algorithms, such as phase estimation and QSVT-based eigenvalue filtering, work well when a unique ground state is separated by a moderate spectral gap, but in the quasi-degenerate regime they require resolution finer than the intra-manifold splitting; otherwise, they return an uncontrolled superposition within the low-energy span and fail to detect or resolve degeneracies. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm that directly diagonalizes such quasi-degenerate manifolds by solving an effective-Hamiltonian eigenproblem in a low-dimensional reference subspace. This reduced problem is exactly equivalent to the full eigenproblem, and its solutions are lifted to the full Hilbert space via a block-encoded wave operator. Our analysis provides provable bounds on eigenvalue accuracy and subspace fidelity, together with total query complexity, demonstrating that quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems can be solved efficiently without assuming any intra-manifold splitting. We benchmark the algorithm on several systems (the Fermi-Hubbard model, LiH, and the transition-metal complex [Ru(bpy)$_3$]$^{2+}$), demonstrating robust performance and reliable resolution of (quasi-)degeneracies.</p>

            <p>Magnomechanical systems with YIG spheres have been proven to be an ideal system for studying magnomechanically induced transparency, dynamical backaction, and rich nonlinear effects, such as the magnon-phonon cross-Kerr effect. Accurate characterization of the magnetostriction induced deformation displacement is important as it can be used for, e.g., estimating the magnon excitation number and the strength of the dynamical backaction. Here we propose an optical approach for detecting the magnetostrictive deformation of a YIG sphere in three dimensions (3Ds) with high precision. It is based on the deformation induced spatial high-order modes of the scattered field, postselection, and balanced homodyne detection. With feasible parameters, we show that the measurement precision of the deformation in $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions can reach the picometer level. We further reveal the advantages of our scheme using a higher-order probe beam and balanced homodyne detection by means of quantum and classical Fisher information. The real-time and high-precision measurement of the YIG sphere's deformation in 3Ds can be used to determinate specific mechanical modes, characterize the magnomechanical dynamical backaction and the 3D cooling of the mechanical vibration, and thus finds a wide range of applications in magnomechanics.</p>

            <p>Randomness is a fundamental resource in quantum information, with crucial applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. A central challenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate Haar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford operations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able to generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial quantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford gates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design only to a subsystem of size $\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This "seed" design is then "diluted" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between two random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this construction achieves full quantum security against adaptive adversaries using only $\tilde{O}(k^2 \log\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requires security only against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford cost decreases to $\tilde{O}(k + \log^{1+c} \varepsilon^{-1})$. This is optimal, since we show that at least $\Omega(k)$ non-Clifford gates are required in this setting. Compared to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces non-Clifford overhead while strengthening security guarantees to adaptive security as well as removing artificial assumptions between $n$ and $k$. These results make high-order unitary designs practically attainable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>Structured variational quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) have emerged as leading candidates for exploiting advantages of near-term quantum hardware. They interlace classical computation, in particular optimisation of variational parameters, with quantum-specific routines, and combine problem-specific advantages -- sometimes even provable -- with adaptability to the constraints of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While circuit depth can be parametrically increased and is known to improve performance in an ideal (noiseless) setting, on realistic hardware greater depth exacerbates noise: The overall quality of results depends critically on both, variational parameters and circuit depth. Although identifying optimal parameters is NP-hard, prior work has suggested that they may exhibit regular, predictable patterns for increasingly deep circuits and depending on the studied class of problems. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of classical parameters in QAOA performance through extensive numerical simulations and suggest a simple, yet effective heuristic scheme to find good parameters for low-depth circuits. Our results demonstrate that: (i) optimal parameters often deviate substantially from expected patterns; (ii) QAOA performance becomes progressively less sensitive to specific parameter choices as depth increases; and (iii) iterative component-wise fixing performs on par with, and at shallow depth may even outperform, several established parameter-selection strategies. We identify conditions under which structured parameter patterns emerge, and when deviations from the patterns warrant further consideration. These insights for low-depth circuits may inform more robust pathways to harnessing QAOA in realistic quantum compute scenarios.</p>

Operationally, each extremal quantum channel factors as unitary Schur sampling $\rightarrow$ an irrep-level unitary-equivariant quantum channel $\rightarrow$ the adjoint unitary Schur sampling. We give a streaming implementation ansatz that uses an efficient streaming implementation of unitary Schur sampling together with a resource-state primitive, and we apply it to state symmetrization, symmetric cloning, and purity amplification. In these applications we obtain polynomial-time algorithms with exponential memory improvements in $m,n$. Further, for symmetric cloning we present, to our knowledge, the first efficient (polynomial-time) algorithm with explicit memory and gate bounds.</p>

            <p>As quantum devices scale, quantifying how close an experimental state aligns with a target becomes both vital and challenging. Fidelity is the standard metric, but existing estimators either require full tomography or apply only to restricted state/measurement families. Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2025) introduced an efficient certification protocol for Haar-random states using only a polynomial number of non-adaptive, single-copy, local Pauli measurements. Here, we adopt the same data collection routine but recast it as a fidelity estimation protocol with rigorous performance guarantees and broaden its applicability. We analyze the bias in this estimator, linking its performance to the mixing time $\tau$ of a Markov chain induced by the target state, and resolve the three open questions posed by Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2025). Our analysis extends beyond Haar-random states to state $t$-designs, states prepared by low-depth random circuits, physically relevant states and families of mixed states. We introduce a $k$-generalized local escape property that identifies when the fidelity estimation protocol is both efficient and accurate, and design a practical empirical test to verify its applicability for arbitrary states. This work enables scalable benchmarking, error characterization, and tomography assistance, supports adaptive quantum algorithms in high dimensions, and clarifies fundamental limits of learning from local measurements.</p>

We use two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.</p>

Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</p>

            <h2>Hyper-optimized Quantum Lego Contraction Schedules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balint Pato, June Vanlerberghe, Kenneth R. Brown</p>
            <p>Calculating the quantum weight enumerator polynomial (WEP) is a valuable tool for characterizing quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes, but it is computationally hard for large or complex codes. The Quantum LEGO (QL) framework provides a tensor network approach for WEP calculation, in some cases offering superpolynomial speedups over brute-force methods, provided the code exhibits area law entanglement, that a good QL layout is used, and an efficient tensor network contraction schedule is found. We analyze the performance of a hyper-optimized contraction schedule framework across QL layouts for diverse stabilizer code families. We find that the intermediate tensors in the QL networks for stabilizer WEPs are often highly sparse, invalidating the dense-tensor assumption of standard cost functions. To address this, we introduce an exact, polynomial-time Sparse Stabilizer Tensor (SST) cost function based on the rank of the parity check matrices for intermediate tensors. The SST cost function correlates perfectly with the true contraction cost, providing a significant advantage over the default cost function, which exhibits large uncertainty. Optimizing contraction schedules using the SST cost function yields substantial performance gains, achieving up to orders of magnitude improvement in actual contraction cost compared to using the dense tensor cost function. Furthermore, the precise cost estimation from the SST function offers an efficient metric to decide whether the QL-based WEP calculation is computationally superior to brute force for a given QL layout. These results, enabled by PlanqTN, a new open-source QL implementation, validate hyper-optimized contraction as a crucial technique for leveraging the QL framework to explore the QEC code design space.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing optomechanical force sensing utilizing synthetic magnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding-hui Xu, Zheng Liu, Chang-shui Yu</p>
            <p>In precision force sensing of multi-mechanical mode optomechanical systems, coherent interference can decouple certain degenerate vibrational modes from the cavity field, leading to incomplete information regarding the measured signal. In this paper, we propose a scheme to enhance and control the detection bandwidth in optomechanical force sensing by exploiting synthetic magnetism achieved through tuning phonon hopping interactions. By toggling between broken and unbroken dark mode, this approach effectively manages the response bandwidth and exhibits intriguing additional noise characteristics. Specifically, when the dark mode remains unbroken, the thermal noise is robust and reduced to half of that of a standard device. In contrast, when the dark mode is broken, thermal noise increases substantially at mechanical resonance but remains the same as when the dark mode is unbroken at effective detection frequencies. Moreover, our scheme offers the dual benefit of amplifying the mechanical response while suppressing additional noise, with the potential to surpass the standard quantum limit.</p>

            <p>We investigate the formulation of work distributions for quantum scalar fields in static curved spacetimes by extending the Ramsey interferometric protocol originally developed in previous works for flat spacetimes. The use of Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors provides a causally consistent framework to define and measure work statistics, avoiding the limitations of the two-time projective measurement scheme in relativistic quantum field theory. We derive a non-perturbative expression for the characteristic function of the quantum field and apply it to thermal Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states, showing that the resulting work distributions satisfy both the Crooks fluctuation theorem and the Jarzynski equality. Furthermore, we analyse the case of a pointlike detector, obtaining compact expressions for the first two moments of the work distribution, allowing us to recover the standard fluctuation-dissipation relation in the high-temperature limit. Our results demonstrate that fluctuation theorems hold for quantum fields interacting with Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors in static curved spacetimes.</p>

            <p>Binary optimisation tasks are ubiquitous in areas ranging from logistics to cryptography. The exponential complexity of such problems means that the performance of traditional computational methods decreases rapidly with increasing problem sizes. Here, we propose a new algorithm for binary optimisation, the Bosonic Binary Solver, designed for near-term photonic quantum processors. This variational algorithm uses samples from a quantum optical circuit, which are post-processed using trainable classical bit-flip probabilities, to propose candidate solutions. A gradient-based training loop finds progressively better solutions until convergence. We perform ablation tests that validate the structure of the algorithm. We then evaluate its performance on an illustrative range of binary optimisation problems, using both simulators and real hardware, and perform comparisons to classical algorithms. We find that this algorithm produces high-quality solutions to these problems. As such, this algorithm is a promising method for leveraging the scalable nature of photonic quantum processors to solve large-scale real-world optimisation problems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a general framework for weak transversal gates -- probabilistic implementation of logical unitaries realized by local physical unitaries -- and propose a novel partially fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture that surpasses the standard Clifford+T architecture on workloads with million-scale Clifford+T gate counts. First, we prove the existence of weak transversal gates on the class of Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes, covering high-rate qLDPC and topological codes such as surface code or color codes, and present an efficient algorithm to determine the physical multi-qubit Pauli rotations required for the desired logical rotation. Second, we propose a partially fault-tolerant Clifford+$\phi$ architecture that performs in-place Pauli rotations via a repeat-until-success strategy; phenomenological simulations indicate that a rotation of 0.003 attains logical error of $9.5\times10^{-5}$ on a surface code with $d=7$ at physical error rate of $10^{-4}$, while avoiding the spacetime overheads of magic state factories, small angle synthesis, and routing. Finally, we perform resource estimation on surface and gross codes for a Trotter-like circuit with $N=108$ logical qubits to show that the Clifford+$\phi$ architecture outperforms the conventional Clifford+T approach by a factor of tens to a hundred in runtime due to natural rotation-gate parallelism.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haomu Yuan, Daniel Stilck França, Ilia Luchnikov, Egor Tiunov, Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita</p>
            <p>Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in various applications and are known to be NP-hard. The seminal work of Goemans and Williamson introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for such problems, solvable in polynomial time that upper bounds the optimal value. Their approach also enables randomized rounding techniques to obtain feasible solutions with provable performance guarantees. In this work, we identify instances of QUBO problems where matrix multiplicative weight methods lead to quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms that approximate the Goemans-Williamson SDP exponentially faster than existing methods, achieving polylogarithmic time complexity relative to the problem dimension. This speedup is attainable under the assumption that the QUBO cost matrix is sparse when expressed as a linear combination of Pauli strings satisfying certain algebraic constraints, and leverages efficient quantum and classical simulation results for quantum Gibbs states. We demonstrate how to verify these conditions efficiently given the decomposition. Additionally, we explore heuristic methods for randomized rounding procedures and extract the energy of a feasible point of the QUBO in polylogarithmic time. While the practical relevance of instances where our methods excel remains to be fully established, we propose heuristic algorithms with broader applicability and identify Kronecker graphs as a promising class for applying our techniques. We conduct numerical experiments to benchmark our methods. Notably, by utilizing tensor network methods, we solve an SDP with $D = 2^{50}$ variables and extract a feasible point which is certifiably within $0.15\%$ of the optimum of the QUBO through our approach on a desktop, reaching dimensions millions of times larger than those handled by existing SDP or QUBO solvers, whether heuristic or rigorous.</p>

            <p>In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty -- particularly an agent's tolerance for risk -- determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a Rényi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor G. Vladimirov, Ian R. Petersen, Guodong Shi</p>
            <p>This paper is concerned with open quantum memory systems for approximately retaining quantum information, such as initial dynamic variables or quantum states to be stored over a bounded time interval. In the Heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics, the deviation of the system variables from their initial values lends itself to closed-form computation in terms of tractable moment dynamics for open quantum harmonic oscillators and finite-level quantum systems governed by linear or quasi-linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations, respectively. This tractability is used in a recently proposed optimality criterion for varying the system parameters so as to maximise the memory decoherence time when the mean-square deviation achieves a given critical threshold. The memory decoherence time maximisation approach is extended beyond the previously considered low-threshold asymptotic approximation and to Schrödinger type mean-square deviation functionals for the reduced system state governed by the Lindblad master equation. We link this approach with the minimisation of the mean-square deviation functionals at a finite time horizon and with their discounted version which quantifies the averaged performance of the quantum system as a temporary memory under a Poisson flow of storage requests.</p>

            <p>We developed a general framework for synthesizing target gates by using a finite set of basic gates, which is a crucial step in quantum compilation. When approximating a gate in SU($n$), a naive brute-force search requires a computational complexity of $O(1/\varepsilon^{(n^2 - 1)})$ to achieve an approximation with error $\varepsilon$. In contrast, by using our method, the complexity can be reduced to $O(-n^2 \log\varepsilon/\varepsilon^{((n^2 - 1)/2)})$. This method requires almost no assumptions and can be applied to a variety of gate sets, including Clifford+$T$ and Clifford+$V$. Further, we introduce a suboptimal but short run-time algorithm for synthesizing multi-qubit controlled gates. This approach highlights the role of subgroup structures in reducing synthesis complexity and opens a new direction of study on the compilation of multi-qubit gates. The framework is broadly applicable to different universal gate sets, and our analysis suggests that it can serve as a foundation for resource-efficient quantum compilation in near-term architectures.</p>

            <p>Scaling up the number of qubits available on quantum processors remains technically demanding even in the long term; it is therefore crucial to clarify the number of qubits required to implement a given quantum operation. For the most general class of quantum operations, known as quantum instruments, the qubit requirements are not well understood, especially when mid-circuit measurements and delayed input preparation are permitted. In this work, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the number of qubits required to implement a given quantum instrument in terms of the causal structure of the instrument. We further apply our results to entanglement distillation protocols based on stabilizer codes and show that, in these cases, the lower and upper bounds coincide, so the optimal qubit requirement is determined. In particular, we compute that the optimal number of qubits is 3 for the $[[9,1,3]]$-code-based protocol and 4 for the $[[5,1,3]]$-code-based protocol.</p>

            <p>Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits. Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move'' dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are ``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generic framework for solving linear programs (LPs) with many constraints $(n \gg d)$ via adaptive sparsification. Our approach provides a principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method. Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution to an LP using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix. This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP solvers.</p>

We reveal selective higher-order topological states with a unique dynamical ``chasing" behavior, protected by a generalized chiral symmetry and enabling efficient topological directional transfer. By introducing an impurity atom -- a giant atom -- coupled to all array atoms, we observe chiral emission patterns strongly dependent on the atomic polarization. This nonlocal coupling structure allows exploration of self-interference effects at subwavelength scales. Our findings establish AMs as a versatile platform for engineering tunable topological states and chiral quantum optical phenomena, with potential applications in customized light sources and photonic devices.</p>

            <p>The spontaneous breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry typically gives rise to emergent excitations possessing the same symmetry with a renormalized mass. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we present a theory in which the low-lying excitation in the broken-symmetry phase acquires a continuous symmetry, even when the underlying symmetry of the system is discrete. In the presence of anisotropic long-range interactions, the order parameter renormalizes the relative strength of the particle-conserving and particle-nonconserving interactions. When one of the two renormalized interactions vanishes, a conservation law absent in the original Hamiltonian emerges, giving rise to a continuous symmetry. A striking consequence of the emergent continuous symmetry and conservation law is that it constrains quantum correlations in the ground-state to be zero, leading to the ground-state factorization in the presence of strong interactions. Our finding is a universal feature of quantum phase transitions in fully-connected systems and in their lattice generalizations; therefore, it can be observed in a wide range of physical systems.</p>

            <p>A classical obfuscator for quantum circuits is a classical program that, given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, outputs the classical description of a functionally equivalent quantum circuit $\hat{Q}$ that hides as much as possible about $Q$. Previously, the only known feasibility result for classical obfuscation of quantum circuits (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) was limited to circuits that always reject. On the other hand, if the obfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit $Q$ into a quantum state $|\hat{Q}\rangle$, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and all unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025). We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical obfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. We do this by giving the first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum evaluation, relative to a classical oracle. To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on the approach of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which required ciphertexts that are both quantum and non-compact due to the use of quantum coset states and their publicly-verifiable properties. We introduce new techniques for analyzing coset states that can be generated ''on the fly'', by proving new cryptographic properties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025). Our techniques allow us to produce QFHE ciphertexts that are purely classical, compact, and publicly-verifiable. This also yields the first classical verification of quantum computation protocol for BQP that simultaneously satisfies blindness and public-verifiability.</p>

To achieve this, we extend previous work on flag gadgets for syndrome extraction to a general framework that flags any Clifford circuit. This framework opens new pathways toward universal fault tolerance by allowing transversal implementation of $T$ gates alongside fault-tolerant realization of selected non-transversal Clifford gates using flags. The construction we present allows a Clifford circuit consisting of $n$ two-qubit gates and $O(n)$ single-qubit gates acting upon physical qubits in a code of distance $d$ to be made fault tolerant to distance $d$ using $O(d^2 \log(nd^2\log n))$ ancilla qubits and $O(nd^2 \log(nd^2 \log n))$ extra CNOTs. Beyond asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate our construction by implementing the non-transversal logical Hadamard gate for the [[15,1,3]] code, which has transversal T, and compare to alternative approaches for universality using this code.

This problem appears in many algorithmic applications, and is also a fundamental problem in complexity theory, due to its ${\sf NL}$-completeness. We show that for any $S\geq \log^2(n)$, there is a quantum algorithm for DSTCON using space $S$ and time $T\leq 2^{\frac{1}{2}\log(n)\log(n/S)+o(\log^2(n))}$, which is an (up to quadratic) improvement over the best classical algorithm for any $S=o(\sqrt{n})$. Of the $S$ total space used by our algorithm, only $O(\log^2(n))$ is quantum space - the rest is classical. This effectively means that we can trade off classical space for quantum time.</p>

However, extending this idea to self-testing both communicating parties has remained unclear. Here, we introduce a modified setup that enables local self-tests for both Alice and Bob and analyze its security against potential attacks. Employing modern tools from robust self-testing, we show that in a BB84-type protocol between the self-tested devices, the achievable key rate varies continuously with the winning probability of the local tests. In particular, we find that perfect local Bell tests can, in principle, overcome the detection-efficiency barrier, rendering the asymptotic key rate limited only by standard bit-flip errors, as in the device-dependent case.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical error reshaping for dual-rail erasure qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippos Dakis, Sophia E. Economou, Edwin Barnes</p>
            <p>Erasure qubits -- qubits designed to have an error profile that is dominated by detectable leakage errors -- are a promising way to cut down the resources needed for quantum error correction. There have been several recent experiments demonstrating erasure qubits in superconducting quantum processors, most notably the dual-rail qubit defined by the one-photon subspace of two coupled cavities. An outstanding challenge is that the ancillary transmons needed to facilitate erasure checks and two-qubit gates introduce a substantial amount of noise, limiting the benefits of working with erasure-biased qubits. Here, we show how to suppress the adverse effects of transmon-induced noise while performing erasure checks or two-qubit gates. We present control schemes for these operations that suppress erasure check errors by two orders of magnitude and reduce the logical two-qubit gate infidelities by up to three orders of magnitude.</p>

            <h2>A resource theory of gambling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maite Arcos, Renato Renner, Jonathan Oppenheim</p>
            <p>Betting games provide a natural setting to capture how information yields strategic advantage. The Kelly criterion for betting, long a cornerstone of portfolio theory and information theory, admits an interpretation in the limit of infinitely many repeated bets. We extend Kelly's seminal result into the single-shot and finite-betting regimes, recasting it as a resource theory of adversarial information. This allows one to quantify what it means for the gambler to have more information than the odds-maker. Given a target rate of return, after a finite number of bets, we compute the optimal strategy which maximises the probability of successfully reaching the target, revealing a risk-reward trade-off characterised by a hierarchy of Rényi divergences between the true distribution and the odds. The optimal strategies in the one-shot regime coincide with strategies maximizing expected utility, and minimising hypothesis testing errors, thereby bridging economic and information-theoretic viewpoints. We then generalize this framework to a distributed side-information game, in which multiple players observe correlated signals about an unknown state. Recasting gambling as an adversarial resource theory provides a unifying lens that connects economic and information-theoretic perspectives, and allows for generalisation to the quantum domain, where quantum side-information and entanglement play analogous roles.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Variable Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit via Displacement-Random Unitary Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi Huang, Lixing Zhang, Di Luo</p>
            <p>Characterizing the Hamiltonians of continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems is a fundamental challenge laden with difficulties arising from infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and unbounded operators. Existing protocols for achieving the Heisenberg limit precision are often restricted to specific Hamiltonian structures or demand experimentally challenging resources. In this work, we introduce an efficient and experimentally accessible protocol, the Displacement-Random Unitary Transformation (D-RUT), that learns the coefficients of general, arbitrary finite-order bosonic Hamiltonians with a total evolution time scaling as $O(1/\epsilon)$ for a target precision $\epsilon$ robust to SPAM error. For multi-mode systems, we develop a hierarchical coefficients recovering strategy with superior statistical efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our protocol to first quantization, enabling the learning of fundamental physical parameters from Hamiltonians expressed in position and momentum operators at the Heisenberg limit.</p>

            <p>We introduce a systematic approach for analyzing device-independent single-prover interactive protocols under computational assumptions. This is done by establishing an explicit correspondence with Bell inequalities and nonlocal games and constructing a computational space of this http URL show how computational assumptions are converted to computational Bell inequalities, in their rigorous mathematical sense, a hyperplane that separates the sets of classical and quantum verifier-prover interactions. We reveal precisely how the nonsignaling assumption in standard device-independent setups interchanges with the computational challenge of learning a hidden input (that we define). We further utilize our fundamental results to study explicit protocols using the new perspective. We take advantage of modular tools for studying nonlocality, deriving tighter Tsirelson bounds for single-prover protocols and bounding the entropy generated in the interaction, improving on previous results. Our work thus establishes a modular approach to analyzing single-prover quantum certification protocols based on computational assumptions through the fundamental lens of Bell inequalities, removing many layers of technical overhead. The link that we draw between single-prover protocols and Bell inequalities goes far beyond the spread intuitive understanding or known results about "compiled nonlocal games"; Notably, it captures the exact way in which the correspondence between computational assumptions and locality should be understood also in protocols based on, e.g., trapdoor claw-free functions (in which there is no clear underlying nonlocal game).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujit Rao</p>
            <p>We give a convergent hierarchy of SDP certificates for bounding the spectral gap of local qubit Hamiltonians from below. Our approach is based on the NPA hierarchy applied to a polynomially-sized system of constraints defining the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2^{n})$, as well as additional constraints which put restrictions on the corresponding representations of the algebra. We also use as input an upper bound on the ground state energy, either using a hierarchy introduced by Fawzi, Fawzi, and Scalet, or an analog for qubit Hamiltonians of the Lasserre hierarchy of upper bounds introduced by Klep, Magron, Massé, and Volčič. The convergence of the certificates does not require that the Hamiltonian be frustration-free. We prove that the resulting certificates have polynomial size at fixed degree and converge asymptotically (in fact, at level $n$), by showing that all allowed representations of the algebra correspond to the second exterior power $\wedge^2(\mathbb{C}^{2^n})$, which encodes the sum of the two smallest eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian. We also give an example showing that for a commuting 1-local Hamiltonian, the hierarchy certifies a nontrivial lower bound on the spectral gap.</p>

            <h2>Parallel Spooky Pebbling Makes Regev Factoring More Practical</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory D. Kahanamoku-Meyer, Seyoon Ragavan, Katherine Van Kirk</p>
            <p>"Pebble games," an abstraction from classical reversible computing, have found use in the design of quantum circuits for inherently sequential tasks. Gidney showed that allowing Hadamard basis measurements during pebble games can dramatically improve costs -- an extension termed "spooky pebble games" because the measurements leave temporary phase errors called ghosts. In this work, we define and study parallel spooky pebble games. Previous work by Blocki, Holman, and Lee (TCC 2022) and Gidney studied the benefits offered by either parallelism or spookiness individually; here we show that these resources can yield impressive gains when used together. First, we show by construction that a line graph of length $\ell$ can be pebbled in depth $2\ell$ (which is exactly optimal) using space $\leq 2.47\log \ell$. Then, to explore pebbling schemes using even less space, we use a highly optimized $A^*$ search implemented in Julia to find the lowest-depth parallel spooky pebbling possible for a range of concrete line graph lengths $\ell$ given a constant number of pebbles $s$. We show that these techniques can be applied to Regev's factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025) to significantly reduce the cost of its arithmetic. For example, we find that 4096-bit integers $N$ can be factored in multiplication depth 193, which outperforms the 680 required of previous variants of Regev and the 444 reported by Ekerå and Gärtner for Shor's algorithm (IACR Communications in Cryptology 2025). While space-optimized implementations of Shor's algorithm remain likely the best candidates for first quantum factorization of large integers, our results show that Regev's algorithm may have practical importance in the future, especially given the possibility of further optimization. Finally, we believe our pebbling techniques will find applications in quantum cryptanalysis beyond integer factorization.</p>

            <p>The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingxuan Liu, Ge Bai, Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>Estimating the state of an open quantum system monitored over time requires incorporating information from past measurements (filtering) and, for improved accuracy, also from future measurements (smoothing). While classical smoothing is well-understood within Bayesian framework, its quantum generalization has been challenging, leading to distinct and seemingly incompatible approaches. In this work, we resolve this conceptual divide by developing a comprehensive retrodictive framework for quantum state smoothing. We demonstrate that existing theories are special cases within our formalism, corresponding to different extended prior beliefs. Our theory unifies the field and naturally extends it to a broader class of scenarios. We also explore the behavior of updates when using different priors with the same marginal and prove that the upper and lower bounds on average entropy of smoothed states are achieved by the Petz-Fuchs smoothed state and the CLHS smoothed state, respectively. Our results establish that quantum state smoothing is fundamentally a retrodictive process, finally bringing it into a closer analogy with classical smoothing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Mao, Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</p>

            <p>Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative models that progressively transform probability distributions according to learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally related to the Schrödinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples) for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem, plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models, such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.</p>

A key challenge for both paradigms is the effect of imperfections and noise on predictive power. In this work, we present a rigorous and physically transparent comparison of the stability of digital and analog quantum simulators under a variety of perturbative noise models. We provide rigorous worst- and average-case error bounds for noisy quantum simulation of local observables. We find that the two paradigms show comparable scaling in the worst case, while exhibiting different forms of enhanced error cancellation on average. We further analyze Gaussian and Brownian noise processes, deriving concentration bounds that capture typical deviations beyond worst-case guarantees. These results provide a unified framework for quantifying the robustness of noisy quantum simulations and identify regimes where digital methods have intrinsic advantages and when we can see similar behavior.</p>

Compared to the lattice-based approaches, the continuum presents new mathematical challenges: the state space is infinite-dimensional and the Hamiltonian contains the Laplacian, which is unbounded in the continuum and thus produces an unbounded speed of information propagation. Our framework addresses these difficulties through novel optimization methods or information-propagation bounds in combination with a priori regularity assumptions on the external potential. The resulting algorithm provides a unified and robust approach that covers both Coulomb interactions and other classes of physically relevant potentials. One possible application is the characterization of charge and position of nuclei and ions in quantum chemistry. Our results thus lay the foundation for a scalable and generalizable toolkit to explore fermionic systems governed by continuous-space interactions.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of agnostic tomography with \emph{mixed state} ansatz, and specifically, the natural ansatz class of product mixed states. In more detail, given $N$ copies of an $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which is $\epsilon$-close to a product mixed state $\pi$, the goal is to output a nearly-optimal product mixed state approximation to $\rho$. While there has been a flurry of recent work on agnostic tomography, prior work could only handle pure state ansatz, such as product states or stabilizer states. Here we give an algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states which finds a product state which is $O(\epsilon \log 1 / \epsilon)$ close to $\rho$ which uses polynomially many copies of $\rho$, and which runs in polynomial time. Moreover, our algorithm only uses single-qubit, single-copy measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm that achieves any non-trivial agnostic tomography guarantee for any class of mixed state ansatz. Our algorithm proceeds in two main conceptual steps, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we demonstrate a novel, black-box efficient reduction from agnostic tomography of product mixed states to the classical task of \emph{robustly learning binary product distributions} -- a textbook problem in robust statistics. We then demonstrate a nearly-optimal efficient algorithm for the classical task of robustly learning a binary product, answering an open problem in the literature. Our approach hinges on developing a new optimal certificate of closeness for binary product distributions that can be leveraged algorithmically via a carefully defined convex relaxation. Finally, we complement our upper bounds with a lower bound demonstrating that adaptivity is information-theoretically necessary for our agnostic tomography task, so long as the algorithm only uses single-qubit two-outcome projective measurements.</p>

            <p>The assumed hardness of the Shortest Vector Problem in high-dimensional lattices is one of the cornerstones of post-quantum cryptography. The fastest known heuristic attacks on SVP are via so-called sieving methods. While these still take exponential time in the dimension $d$, they are significantly faster than non-heuristic approaches and their heuristic assumptions are verified by extensive experiments. $k$-Tuple sieving is an iterative method where each iteration takes as input a large number of lattice vectors of a certain norm, and produces an equal number of lattice vectors of slightly smaller norm, by taking sums and differences of $k$ of the input vectors. Iterating these ''sieving steps'' sufficiently many times produces a short lattice vector. The fastest attacks (both classical and quantum) are for $k=2$, but taking larger $k$ reduces the amount of memory required for the attack. In this paper we improve the quantum time complexity of 3-tuple sieving from $2^{0.3098 d}$ to $2^{0.2846 d}$, using a two-level amplitude amplification aided by a preprocessing step that associates the given lattice vectors with nearby ''center points'' to focus the search on the neighborhoods of these center points. Our algorithm uses $2^{0.1887d}$ classical bits and QCRAM bits, and $2^{o(d)}$ qubits. This is the fastest known quantum algorithm for SVP when total memory is limited to $2^{0.1887d}$.</p>

In particular, we investigate the coupling between nuclear spins and NV centers in the neutral and negatively charged states. Further, we perform high precision NMR and coherent control of families of carbon 13 nuclear spin ensembles in the $m_s$=0 level of the NV ground state. Applying an off-axis magnetic field reveals the various sites associated with the otherwise degenerate couplings of the carbon 13 sites around the NV electronic spin providing access to all the hyperfine tensor components. Last, we observe spectroscopic signatures of pairs of nuclear spins coupled to the same NV center.

            <p>The instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) quantum circuit Born machine (QCBM) has been proposed as a promising quantum generative model over bitstrings. Recent works have shown that the training of IQP-QCBM is classically tractable w.r.t. the so-called Gaussian kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss function, while maintaining the potential of a quantum advantage for sampling itself. Nonetheless, the model has a number of aspects where improvements would be important for more general utility: (1) the basic model is known to be not universal - i.e. it is not capable of representing arbitrary distributions, and it was not known whether it is possible to achieve universality by adding hidden (ancillary) qubits; (2) a fixed Gaussian kernel used in the MMD loss can cause training issues, e.g., vanishing gradients. In this paper, we resolve the first question and make decisive strides on the second. We prove that for an $n$-qubit IQP generator, adding $n + 1$ hidden qubits makes the model universal. For the latter, we propose a kernel-adaptive training method, where the kernel is adversarially trained. We show that in the kernel-adaptive method, the convergence of the MMD value implies weak convergence in distribution of the generator. We also analytically analyze the limitations of the MMD-based training method. Finally, we verify the performance benefits on the dataset crafted to spotlight improvements by the suggested method. The results show that kernel-adaptive training outperforms a fixed Gaussian kernel in total variation distance, and the gap increases with the dataset dimensionality. These modifications and analyses shed light on the limits and potential of these new quantum generative methods, which could offer the first truly scalable insights in the comparative capacities of classical versus quantum models, even without access to scalable quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Rüsch, Benjamin Rodatz, Aleks Kissinger</p>
            <p>Two circuits are considered to be equivalent under noise if the effect of faults on one circuit is no worse than the effect of faults on the other circuit. We call this relationship fault equivalence. Fault equivalence offers a way to transform circuits while provably preserving their fault-tolerant properties, enabling a framework for fault-tolerant circuit synthesis and optimisation that is correct by construction. The ZX calculus, a set of graphical rewrite rules for quantum computations, provides a useful tool for manipulating circuits while preserving fault equivalence. For this, the usual set of ZX rewrites has to be restricted to not only preserve the underlying linear map represented by the diagram but also fault equivalence. In this work, we provide a set of ZX rewrites that are sound and complete for fault equivalence of Clifford ZX diagrams. This means that any equivalence that can be derived using the proposed rules is certain to be correct, and any correct equivalence can be derived using only these rules. For this, we utilise diagrammatic constructions called fault gadgets to reason about arbitrary, possibly correlated Pauli faults in ZX diagrams. Fault gadgets allow us to separate the diagram into a fault-free part, which captures the noise-free behaviour of a diagram, and a noisy part that enumerates the effects of all possible faults. Using this, we provide a unique normal form for ZX diagrams under noise and show that any diagram can be brought into this normal form using our proposed rule set.</p>

            <p>In this article, we study a nonlocal game with two questions and three answers per player, which was first considered by Feige in 1991, and show that there is quantum advantage in this game. We prove that the game is a robust self-test for the $3$-dimensional maximally entangled state. Furthermore, we show that the game can be seen as the "or" of two games that each do not have quantum advantage. Lastly, we investigate the behavior of the game with respect to parallel repetition in the classical, quantum and non-signalling case and obtain perfect parallel repetition of the non-signalling value if Feige's game is repeated an even amount of times.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujay Kazi, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</p>

            <h2>Quartic quantum speedups for community detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Schmidhuber, Alexander Zlokapa</p>
            <p>Community detection is a foundational problem in data science. Its natural extension to hypergraphs captures higher-order correlations beyond pairwise interactions. In this work, we develop a quantum algorithm for hypergraph community detection that achieves a quartic quantum speedup over the best known classical algorithm, along with superpolynomial savings in space. Our algorithm is based on the Kikuchi method, which we extend beyond previously considered problems such as Tensor PCA and $p$XORSAT to a broad family of generalized stochastic block models. To demonstrate (near) optimality of this method, we prove matching lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors) in the low-degree framework, showing that the algorithm saturates a smooth statistical-computational tradeoff. The quantum speedup arises from a quantized version of the Kikuchi method and is based on the efficient preparation of a guiding state correlated with the underlying community structure. Our work suggests that prior quantum speedups using the Kikuchi method are sufficiently robust to encompass a broader set of problems than previously believed; we conjecture that a quantity known as marginal order characterizes the existence of these quantum speedups.</p>

            <h2>Compiling Any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ into a (Succinct) Classical Interactive Argument</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Huang, Yael Tauman Kalai</p>
            <p>We present a generic compiler that converts any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ protocol into a succinct interactive argument where the communication and the verifier are classical, and where post-quantum soundness relies on the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of the Learning with Errors ($\mathsf{LWE}$) problem. Prior to this work, such a compiler for $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ was given by Kalai, Lombardi, Vaikuntanathan and Yang (STOC 2022), but the post-quantum soundness of this compiler is still under investigation. More generally, our compiler can be applied to any $\mathsf{QIP}$ protocol which is sound only against semi-malicious provers that follow the prescribed protocol, but with possibly malicious initial state. Our compiler consists of two steps. We first show that if a language $\mathcal{L}$ has a $\mathsf{QIP}$ with semi-malicious soundness, where the prover runs in time $T$, then $\mathcal{L} \in \mathsf{QMATIME}(T)$. Then we construct a succinct classical argument for any such language, where the communication complexity grows polylogarithmically with $T$, under the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of $\mathsf{LWE}$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Zlokapa, Bobak T. Kiani, Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
            <p>Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sitan Chen, Jordan Cotler, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Stilck França, Tim Möbus, Cambyse Rouzé, Albert H. Werner</p>
            <p>Hamiltonian learning protocols are essential tools to benchmark quantum computers and simulators. Yet rigorous methods for time-dependent Hamiltonians and Lindbladians remain scarce despite their wide use. We close this gap by learning the time-dependent evolution of a locally interacting $n$-qubit system on a graph of effective dimension $D$ using only preparation of product Pauli eigenstates, evolution under the time-dependent generator for given times, and measurements in product Pauli bases. We assume the time-dependent parameters are well approximated by functions in a known space of dimension $m$ admitting stable interpolation, e.g. by polynomials. Our protocol outputs functions approximating these coefficients to accuracy $\epsilon$ on an interval with success probability $1-\delta$, requiring only $O\big(\epsilon^{-2}poly(m)\log(n\delta^{-1})\big)$ samples and $poly(n,m)$ pre/postprocessing. Importantly, the scaling in $m$ is polynomial, whereas naive extensions of previous methods scale exponentially. The method estimates time derivatives of observable expectations via interpolation, yielding well-conditioned linear systems for the generator's coefficients. The main difficulty in the time-dependent setting is to evaluate these coefficients at finite times while preserving a controlled link between derivatives and dynamical parameters. Our innovation is to combine Lieb-Robinson bounds, process shadows, and semidefinite programs to recover the coefficients efficiently at constant times. Along the way, we extend state-of-the-art Lieb-Robinson bounds on general graphs to time-dependent, dissipative dynamics, a contribution of independent interest. These results provide a scalable tool to verify state-preparation procedures (e.g. adiabatic protocols) and characterize time-dependent noise in quantum devices.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of protocols that localize entanglement in large multi-qubit states onto a subset of qubits by measuring the remaining qubits. We use the maximal average n-tangle that can be generated on a fixed subsystem by measuring its complement -- either with local or global measurements -- as our key figure of merit. These quantities are known respectively as the localizable entanglement (LE) and the entanglement of assistance (EA). We build upon the work of [arXiv:2411.04080] that proposed a polynomial-time test, based on the EA, for whether it is possible to transform certain graph states into others using local measurements. We show, using properties of the EA, that this test is effective and useful in large systems for a wide range of sizes of the measured subsystem. In particular, we use this test to demonstrate the surprising result that general local unitaries and global measurements will typically not provide an advantage over the more experimentally feasible local Clifford unitaries and local Pauli measurements in transforming large linear cluster states into GHZ states. Finally, we derive concentration inequalities for the LE and EA over Haar-random states which indicate that the localized entanglement structure has a striking dependence on the locality of the measurement. In deriving these concentration inequalities, we develop several technical tools that may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanqiang Zhao, Benchi Zhao, Giulio Chiribella</p>
            <p>Quantum theory is in principle compatible with scenarios where physical processes take place in an indefinite causal order, a possibility that was shown to yield advantages in several information processing tasks. However, advantages in communication, the most basic form of information processing, have so far remained controversial and hard to prove. Here we develop a framework that can be used to rigorously assess the role of causal order in a scenario where communication links are built by assembling multiple quantum devices. In this setting, we establish a clear-cut advantage of indefinite order in the one-shot transmission of classical messages. On the other hand, we also show that the advantage is not generic to all communication tasks. Notably, we find that indefinite order does not offer any advantage over shared entanglement in the asymptotic scenario where a large number of uses of the same communication device is employed. Overall, our results unveil non-trivial relations between communication, causal order, entanglement, and no-signaling resources in quantum mechanics.</p>

While the focus has traditionally been on exact algorithms, a long line of literature also considers randomized algorithms, which return an approximate solution in faster time. In this work, we adopt a unifying perspective that frames these randomized algorithms in terms of mean estimation. Using it, we first give refined analyses of classical algorithms based on random walks by Cohen-Lewis (`99), and based on sketching by Sarlós (`06) and Drineas-Kannan-Mahoney (`06). We then propose an improvement on Cohen-Lewis that yields a single classical algorithm that is faster than all the other approaches, if we assume no use of (exact) fast matrix multiplication as a subroutine. Second, we demonstrate a quantum speedup on top of these algorithms by using the recent quantum multivariate mean estimation algorithm by Cornelissen-Hamoudi-Jerbi (`22).</p>

            <p>Classical shadows are succinct classical representations of quantum states which allow one to encode a set of properties P of a quantum state rho, while only requiring measurements on logarithmically many copies of rho in the size of P. In this work, we initiate the study of verification of classical shadows, denoted classical shadow validity (CSV), from the perspective of computational complexity, which asks: Given a classical shadow S, how hard is it to verify that S predicts the measurement statistics of a quantum state? We show that even for the elegantly simple classical shadow protocol of [Huang, Kueng, Preskill, Nature Physics 2020] utilizing local Clifford measurements, CSV is QMA-complete. This hardness continues to hold for the high-dimensional extension of said protocol due to [Mao, Yi, and Zhu, PRL 2025]. Among other results, we also show that CSV for exponentially many observables is complete for a quantum generalization of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, yielding the first natural complete problem for such a class.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aram W. Harrow, Angus Lowe, Freek Witteveen</p>
            <p>A fundamental task in quantum information is to approximate a pure quantum state in terms of sparse states or, for a bipartite system, states of bounded Schmidt rank. The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations. This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for computing maximum-entropy distributions.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum computation requires not only quantum codes with low memory overhead but also encoded operations with low space-time overhead. High rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes address the former by achieving a high information-encoding rate, yet existing methods for implementing logical operations often suffer from a low information-processing rate, leading to substantial space-time costs. Here, we introduce high-rate surgery, a general scheme that can perform extensive, addressable logical Pauli-product measurements in parallel on arbitrary qLDPC codes using a shared ancilla system, attaining nearly constant space-time overhead. We develop both algebraic and randomized ancilla constructions and demonstrate, using the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ Gross code and new instances of qLDPC codes (e.g., $[[1125, 245, \leq 10]]$) with encoding rate up to $25\%$, that up to hundreds of randomly sampled logical measurements can be executed simultaneously with a total space-time overhead around a factor of two of that of memory experiments. Our results address a major bottleneck for performing complex, addressable logical operations on qLDPC codes in practice, advancing the prospect of scalable, constant-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thi Ha Kyaw, Guillermo Romero, Gaurav Saxena</p>
            <p>A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.</p>

            <p>A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.</p>

            <p>A central challenge in quantum physics is to understand the structural properties of many-body systems, both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium. For classical systems, we have a unified perspective which connects structural properties of systems at thermal equilibrium to the Markov chain dynamics that mix to them. We lack such a perspective for quantum systems: there is no framework to translate the quantitative convergence of the Markovian evolution into strong structural consequences. We develop a general framework that brings the breadth and flexibility of the classical theory to quantum Gibbs states at high temperature. At its core is a natural quantum analog of a Dobrushin condition; whenever this condition holds, a concise path-coupling argument proves rapid mixing for the corresponding Markovian evolution. The same machinery bridges dynamic and structural properties: rapid mixing yields exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI) without restrictions on the size of the probed subsystems, resolving a central question in the theory of open quantum systems. Our key technical insight is an optimal transport viewpoint which couples quantum dynamics to a linear differential equation, enabling precise control over how local deviations from equilibrium propagate to distant sites.</p>

            <p>We investigate the role of energy, i.e. average photon number, as a resource in the computational complexity of bosonic systems. We show three sets of results: (1. Energy growth rates) There exist bosonic gate sets which increase energy incredibly rapidly, obtaining e.g. infinite energy in finite/constant time. We prove these high energies can make computing properties of bosonic computations, such as deciding whether a given computation will attain infinite energy, extremely difficult, formally undecidable. (2. Lower bounds on computational power) More energy ``='' more computational power. For example, certain gate sets allow poly-time bosonic computations to simulate PTOWER, the set of deterministic computations whose runtime scales as a tower of exponentials with polynomial height. Even just exponential energy and $O(1)$ modes suffice to simulate NP, which, importantly, is a setup similar to that of the recent bosonic factoring algorithm of [Brenner, Caha, Coiteux-Roy and Koenig (2024)]. For simpler gate sets, we show an energy hierarchy theorem. (3. Upper bounds on computational power) Bosonic computations with polynomial energy can be simulated in BQP, ``physical'' bosonic computations with arbitrary finite energy are decidable, and the gate set consisting of Gaussian gates and the cubic phase gate can be simulated in PP, with exponential bound on energy, improving upon the previous PSPACE upper bound. Finally, combining upper and lower bounds yields no-go theorems for a continuous-variable Solovay--Kitaev theorem for gate sets such as the Gaussian and cubic phase gates.</p>

            <p>We examine the ability of gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers to outperform qubit or discrete-variable quantum computers. Gate-based continuous-variable operations refer to operations constructed using a polynomial sequence of elementary gates from a specific finite set, i.e., those selected from the set of Gaussian operations and cubic phase gates. Our results show that for a fixed energy of the system, there is no superpolynomial computational advantage in using gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers over discrete-variable ones. The proof of this result consists of defining a framework - of independent interest - that maps quantum circuits between the paradigms of continuous- to discrete-variables. This framework allows us to conclude that a realistic gate-based model of continuous-variable quantum computers, consisting of states and operations that have a total energy that is polynomial in the number of modes, can be simulated efficiently using discrete-variable devices. We utilize the stabilizer subsystem decomposition [Shaw et al., PRX Quantum 5, 010331] to map continuous-variable states to discrete-variable counterparts, which allows us to find the error of approximating continuous-variable quantum computers with discrete-variable ones in terms of the energy of the continuous-variable system and the dimension of the corresponding encoding qudits.</p>

            <p>The rapid advance of quantum hardware is spotlighting pre-fault-tolerant tasks that may no longer be efficiently validated by classical means and are likely to run on potentially untrusted remote quantum servers. This motivates problem-independent verification protocols with rigorous guarantees. The Verifiable Blind Quantum Computation (VBQC) protocol provides delegated computation where the composable security spans the confidentiality and integrity of the computation. However, the success of these cryptographic protocols, especially their low space overhead, is unfortunately confined to problems that admit an algorithm whose output can be amplified through majority voting toward the correct solution. This leaves various notable near-term applications relying on observable estimation without efficient verification protocols. To address these needs, we introduce a protocol implementing Secure Delegated Observable Estimation (SDOE), which efficiently verifies observable estimation performed on an untrusted quantum machine. More precisely, it guarantees that the computed estimate is within some $\epsilon>0$ of the true expectation value or else it aborts. The required overhead is limited to adding test rounds that are not more complex than the unprotected computation that needs to be performed to implement the desired measurement on a given fiducial state; and in addition, the security error is negligible in the total number of rounds of the protocol.</p>

However, existing code-switching protocols that encapsulate recent generalized lattice surgery approaches often either require many rounds of measurements to ensure fault-tolerance or suffer from low code rates. We present a single-shot, universal protocol that uses code-switching between high-rate quantum codes to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation. To our best knowledge, our work contains the first universal fault-tolerant quantum computation protocol that achieves what we term single-shot universality on high-rate codes that is characterized by (i) single-shot error correction, (ii) single-shot state preparation, as well as (iii) universal logical gates and logical measurements with constant depth circuits. We achieve this feat with single-shot code-switching between constant-rate 2D hypergraph product (HGP) codes and high-rate 3D HGP codes that can be viewed as a generalization of Bombin's dimensional jump for color codes and Hillmann et al.'s single-shot lattice surgery for higher-dimensional topological codes. In addition, we prove the fault-tolerance of our code-switching protocol under both the adversarial and local-stochastic noise models. We introduce a vastly simpler recipe to construct high-rate 3D HGP codes with transversal CCZ gates that grants immense flexibility in the choice of expander graphs and local codes, allowing us to expand the search space for codes with good parameters and interesting logical gates. Our work opens an alternative path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with low space-time overhead by circumventing the need for magic state distillation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Filtering of Hydrogen Isotopes through Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Hale, Theja N. De Silva</p>
            <p>Driven by the growing demand in the energy, medical, and industrial sectors, we investigate a hydrogen isotope separation technique that offers both a high separation factor and economic feasibility. Our findings reveal that filtering isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching deuterium by separating it from protium.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative Generation of Currents by Nonreciprocal Local and Global Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Halati</p>
            <p>We investigate the mechanisms necessary for the stabilization of complex quantum correlations by exploring dissipative couplings to nonreciprocal reservoirs. We analyze the role of locality in the coupling to the environment of the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results obtained for two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes, or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states numerical methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a small portion of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.</p>

            <h2>The tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Aniello, Lorenzo Guglielmi, Stefano Mancini, Vincenzo Parisi</p>
            <p>In the framework of quantum mechanics over a quadratic extension of the ultrametric field of p-adic numbers, we introduce a notion of tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. To this end, following a standard approach, we first consider the algebraic tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. We next define a suitable norm on this linear space. It turns out that, in the p-adic framework, this norm is the analogue of the projective norm associated with the tensor product of real or complex normed spaces. Eventually, by metrically completing the resulting p-adic normed space, and equipping it with a suitable inner product, we obtain the tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. That this is indeed the correct p-adic counterpart of the tensor product of complex Hilbert spaces is also certified by establishing a natural isomorphism between this p-adic Hilbert space and the corresponding Hilbert-Schmidt class. Since the notion of subspace of a p-adic Hilbert space is highly nontrivial, we finally study the tensor product of subspaces, stressing both the analogies and the significant differences with respect to the standard complex case. These findings should provide us with the mathematical foundations necessary to explore quantum entanglement in the p-adic setting, with potential applications in the emerging field of p-adic quantum information theory.</p>

            <p>The paper presents variational formulae for entropy-like functionals, including Segal and Rényi entropies, for normal states on semifinite von Neumann algebras. The considered functionals are of the form $\tau(f(h))$ where $\tau$ is a normal faithful semifinite trace on this algebra, $h$ is a positive selfadjoint operator from $L^1(\M,\tau)$, and $f$ is an appropriate convex or concave function. The results cover both finite and semifinite algebras, and the obtained formulae generalise known results, in particular, those concerning relative entropy. Moreover, the connection between quantum entropies and the structure of abelian subalgebras is highlighted, providing new interpretations in the context of quantum information theory.</p>

            <p>Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.</p>

            <p>Precisely addressing single nanostructures inside dense ensembles remains a bottleneck for scalable photonic and quantum information devices. Here we demonstrate, through comprehensive finite element and variational Monte-Carlo modelling, that a reconfigurable three-dimensional array of needle shaped beams can selectively switch the quantum optical response of individual InAs nanorods embedded in GaAs. By tuning the local non resonant intensity pattern the exciton and biexciton energies were calculated, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) windows were examined, and correspondingly near-field diffraction carpets were dynamically reshaped. A single parameter the activation ratio between illuminated and dark nanorods provides continuous control over photoluminescence peak position (80 meV) and EIT bandwidth (six times). We further predict fully programmable Talbot self-imaging in nanorod arrays with sub-wavelength pitch. Importantly, the observed Talbot carpets enable spatially resolved identification of which nanorods were excited, offering a powerful diagnostic for verifying structured-light activation schemes. The concept offers a low crosstalk, wafer scale route toward reconfigurable quantum emitters, tunable diffractive optics and on-chip slow-light components.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Edge Excitations of Fractional Chern Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Han Yang, Ji-Yao Chen, Xiao-Yu Dong</p>
            <p>Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy. We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Spectral Edge in SYK Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ouyang, Pratik Rath</p>
            <p>Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</p>

            <p>We construct a family of distributions $\{\mathcal{D}_n\}_n$ with $\mathcal{D}_n$ over $\{0, 1\}^n$ and a family of depth-$7$ quantum circuits $\{C_n\}_n$ such that $\mathcal{D}_n$ is produced exactly by $C_n$ with the all zeros state as input, yet any constant-depth classical circuit with bounded fan-in gates evaluated on any binary product distribution has total variation distance $1 - e^{-\Omega(n)}$ from $\mathcal{D}_n$. Moreover, the quantum circuits we construct are geometrically local and use a relatively standard gate set: Hadamard, controlled-phase, CNOT, and Toffoli gates. All previous separations of this type suffer from some undesirable constraint on the classical circuit model or the quantum circuits witnessing the separation. Our family of distributions is inspired by the Parity Halving Problem of Watts, Kothari, Schaeffer, and Tal (STOC, 2019), which built on the work of Bravyi, Gosset, and König (Science, 2018) to separate shallow quantum and classical circuits for relational problems.</p>

            <p>Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic. Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by Mølmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schrödinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement without Spin-Analyzing Power Dependence at the Colliders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junle Pei, Tianjun Li, Lina Wu, Xiqing Hao, Xiaochuan Wang</p>
            <p>We study the quantum entanglement at the colliders which is independent of the spin-analyzing powers. Taking $\Lambda(\to p\pi^-)\bar{\Lambda}(\to \bar{p}\pi^+)$ as an example, we investigate whether quantum entanglement in fermion pairs produced at colliders can be certified by using only angular information from final-state decays, while remaining independent of the parity-violating decay parameters $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$. Building on a general decomposition of any angular observable in terms of Wigner d-functions, we show that the expectation value must take the form $\mathcal{O}_0+\mathcal{O}_1\alpha_\Lambda+\mathcal{O}_2\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}+\mathcal{O}_3\alpha_\Lambda\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$, with coefficients $\mathcal{O}_i$ ($i=0,1,2,3$) linear in the spin-density matrix elements $\alpha_{k,j}\alpha^*_{m,n}$. We obtain the value ranges of observables over the general and separable spaces of $\alpha_{k,j}$, and demonstrate a sufficient entanglement condition for pure states, extending it to mixed states by convexity. In constructing an $\alpha_\Lambda$- and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$-independent witness from angular observables alone, we find that there are obstacles to probe quantum entanglement via the inequality-type and ratio-type ways. Finally, we present the successful constructions with additional spin information: for the process of $e^+e^-\to J/\Psi\to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ at $e^+ e^-$ collider, independent spin information provided by beam-axis selection enables the construction of normalized observables $f_i~(i=1,2)$ that are insensitive to $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$; if their measured values lie in $\left[-1,-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\cup\left(\tfrac{1}{2},1\right]$, entanglement is certified, irrespective of purity or mixedness.</p>

            <h2>Faraday patterns, spin textures, spin-spin correlations and competing instabilities in a driven spin-1 antiferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaishakh Kargudri, Sandra M. Jose, Rejish Nath</p>
            <p>We study the formation of transient Faraday patterns and spin textures in driven quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the periodic modulation of $s$-wave scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$, starting from the anti-ferromagnetic phase. This phase is characterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is gapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of the modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday patterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is characterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven above the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin vectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the driven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the gap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices that do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the gap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite polarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension exhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence in quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns dominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent interaction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent interaction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when both scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the competing instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population transfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all other parameters constant.</p>

The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.</p>

            <p>The Walsh-quantized baker's maps are models for quantum chaos on the torus. We show that for all baker's map scaling factors $D\ge2$ except for $D=4$, typically (in the sense of Haar measure on the eigenspaces, which are degenerate) the empirical distribution of the scaled matrix element fluctuations $\sqrt{N}\{\langle \varphi^{(j)}|\operatorname{Op}_{k,\ell}(a)|\varphi^{(j)}\rangle-\int_{\mathbb{T}^2}a\}_{j=1}^{N}$ for a random eigenbasis $\{\varphi^{(j)}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ is asymptotically Gaussian in the semiclassical limit $N\to\infty$, with variance given in terms of classical baker's map correlations. This determines the precise rate of convergence in the quantum ergodic theorem for these eigenbases. We obtain a version of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for these eigenstates, including a limiting complex Gaussian distribution for the off-diagonal matrix elements, with variances also given in terms of classical correlations. The presence of the classical correlations highlights that these eigenstates, while random, have microscopic correlations that differentiate them from Haar random vectors. For the single value $D=4$, the Gaussianity of the matrix element fluctuations depends on the values of the classical observable on a fractal subset of the torus.</p>

            <p>Tensors are fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Their study through algebraic geometry and representation theory has proved very fruitful in the context of algebraic complexity theory and quantum information. In particular, moment polytopes have been understood to play a key role. In quantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes) provide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer a geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they underpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More recently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field of scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization. Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still unknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ only sporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class of reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J. Lie Theory 2002). This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with certainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in $\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability those in $\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit moment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.</p>

            <p>We explore possibilities of entangling two distant material qubits with the help of an optical radiation field in the regime of strong quantum electrodynamical coupling with almost resonant interaction. For this purpose the optimum generalized field measurements are determined which are capable of preparing a two-qubit Bell state by postselection with minimum error. It is demonstrated that in the strong-coupling regime some of the recently found limitations of the non-resonant weak-coupling regime can be circumvented successfully due to characteristic quantum electrodynamical quantum interference effects. In particular, in the absence of photon loss it is possible to postselect two-qubit Bell states with fidelities close to unity by a proper choice of the relevant interaction time. Even in the presence of photon loss this strong-coupling regime offers interesting perspectives for creating spatially well-separated Bell pairs with high fidelities, high success probabilities, and high repetition rates which are relevant for future realizations of quantum repeaters.</p>

            <p>Despite its popularity, several empirical and theoretical studies suggest that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has persistent issues in providing a substantial practical advantage. Numerical results for few qubits and shallow circuits are, at best, ambiguous, and the well-studied barren plateau phenomenon draws a rather sobering picture for deeper circuits. However, as more and more sophisticated strategies are proposed to circumvent barren plateaus, it stands to reason which issues are actually fundamental and which merely constitute - admittedly difficult - engineering tasks. By shifting the scope from the usually considered parameter landscape to the quantum state space's geometry we can distinguish between problems that are fundamentally difficult to solve, independently of the parameterization, and those for which there could at least exist a favorable parameterization. Here, we find clear evidence for a 'no free lunch'-behavior of QAOA on a general optimization task with no further structure; individual cases have, however, to be analyzed more carefully. Based on our analysis, we propose and justify a performance indicator for the deep-circuit QAOA that can be accessed by solely evaluating statistical properties of the classical objective function. We further discuss the various favorable properties a generic QAOA instance has in the asymptotic regime of infinitely many gates, and elaborate on the immanent drawbacks of finite circuits. We provide several numerical examples of a deep-circuit QAOA method based on local search strategies and find that - in alignment with our performance indicator - some special function classes, like QUBOs, indeed admit a favorable optimization landscape.</p>

This learning model is widely used as an abstract computational model for most generic learning algorithms. In particular, for brickwork random quantum circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $d$, we show three main results: - At super logarithmic circuit depth $d=\omega(\log(n))$, any learning algorithm requires super polynomially many queries to achieve a constant probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. - There exists a $d=O(n)$, such that any learning algorithm requires $\Omega(2^n)$ queries to achieve a $O(2^{-n})$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. - At infinite circuit depth $d\to\infty$, any learning algorithm requires $2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ many queries to achieve a $2^{-2^{\Omega(n)}}$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. As an auxiliary result of independent interest, we show that the output distribution of a brickwork random quantum circuit is constantly far from any fixed distribution in total variation distance with probability $1-O(2^{-n})$, which confirms a variant of a conjecture by Aaronson and Chen.</p>

            <p>Recent developments have led to the possibility of embedding machine learning tools into experimental platforms to address key problems, including the characterization of the properties of quantum states. Leveraging on this, we implement a quantum extreme learning machine in a photonic platform to achieve resource-efficient and accurate characterization of the polarization state of a photon. The underlying reservoir dynamics through which such input state evolves is implemented using the coined quantum walk of high-dimensional photonic orbital angular momentum, and performing projective measurements over a fixed basis. We demonstrate how the reconstruction of an unknown polarization state does not need a careful characterization of the measurement apparatus and is robust to experimental imperfections, thus representing a promising route for resource-economic state characterisation.</p>

            <h2>SU(d)-Symmetric Random Unitaries: Quantum Scrambling, Error Correction, and Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zimu Li, Han Zheng, Yunfei Wang, Liang Jiang, Zi-Wen Liu, Junyu Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum information processing in the presence of continuous symmetry is of wide importance and exhibits many novel physical and mathematical phenomena. SU(d) is a continuous group of particular interest since it represents a fundamental type of non-Abelian symmetry and also plays a vital role in quantum computation. Here, we explicate three particularly interesting applications of symmetric random unitaries in diverse contexts ranging from physics to quantum computing: information scrambling with non-Abelian conserved quantities, covariant quantum error correcting random codes, and geometric quantum machine learning. First, we show that, in the presence of SU(d) symmetry, the local conserved quantities would exhibit residual values even at $t \rightarrow \infty$ which decays as $\Omega(1/n^{3/2})$ under local Pauli basis for qubits and $\Omega(1/n^{(d+2)^2/2})$ under symmetric basis for general qudits with respect to the system size, in contrast to O(1/n) decay for U(1) case and the exponential decay for no-symmetry case in the sense of out-of-time ordered correlator. Second, we show that SU(d)-symmetric unitaries can be used to construct asymptotically optimal (in the sense of saturating the fundamental limits on the code error, or the approximate Eastin--Knill theorems) SU(d)-covariant codes that encode any constant number of logical qudits, extending [Kong & Liu; PRXQ 3, 020314 (2022)]. Finally, we derive an overpartameterization threshold via the quantum neural tangent kernel required for exponential convergence guarantee of generic ansatz for geometric quantum machine learning, which reveals that the number of parameters required scales only with the dimension of desired subspaces rather than the entire Hilbert space. Our work invites further research on quantum information with continuous symmetries, where the mathematical tools developed in this work are expected to be useful.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Wei Luo, Ting Yu</p>
            <p>Non-Markovian effects in the dynamics of an open system are typically characterized by non-monotonic information flows from the system to its environment or by information backflows from the environment to the system. Using a two-level system (TLS) coupled to a dissipative single-mode cavity, we demonstrate that the geometric decoherence of the open quantum system can serve as a reliable indicator of non-Markovian dynamics. This geometric approach also reveals finer details of the dynamics, such as the specific time points when non-Markovian behavior emerges. In particular, we show that the divergence of the geometric decoherence factor of the TLS can serve as a sufficient condition for non-Markovian dynamics, and in certain cases, it can even be both a necessary and sufficient condition.</p>

            <h2>Unbounded quantum-classical separation in sample complexity for sphere center finding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanzhong Li, Lvzhou Li</p>
            <p>Fast quantum algorithms can solve important computational problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. However, little is known about whether quantum computing can speed up solving geometric problems. This article explores quantum advantages for the problem of finding the center of a sphere in vector spaces over finite fields, given samples of random points on the sphere. We prove that any classical algorithm for this task requires approximately as many samples as the dimension of the vector space, by a reduction to an old and basic algebraic result -- Warning's second theorem. On the other hand, we propose a quantum algorithm based on quantum walks that needs only a constant number of samples to find the center. Thus, an unbounded quantum advantage is revealed for a natural and intuitive geometric problem, which highlights the power of quantum computing in solving geometric problems.</p>

            <p>Reversing an unknown quantum evolution is of central importance to quantum information processing and fundamental physics, yet it remains a formidable challenge as conventional methods necessitate an infinite number of queries to fully characterize the quantum process. Here we introduce the Quantum Unitary Reversal Algorithm (QURA), a deterministic and exact approach to universally reverse arbitrary unknown unitary transformations using $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ calls of the unitary, where $d$ is the system dimension. Our quantum algorithm resolves a fundamental problem of time-reversal simulations for closed quantum systems by confirming the feasibility of reversing any unitary evolution without knowing the exact process. The algorithm also provides the construction of a key oracle for unitary inversion in many quantum algorithm frameworks, such as quantum singular value transformation. It notably reveals a sharp boundary between the quantum and classical computing realms and unveils a quadratic quantum advantage in computational complexity for this foundational task.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacquiline Romero, Gerard Milburn</p>
            <p>Photonic quantum computation refers to quantum computation that uses photons as the physical system for doing the quantum computation. The field is largely divided between discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation. In the former, quantum information is represented by one or more modal properties (e.g. polarisation) that take on distinct values from a finite set. Quantum information is processed via operations on these modal properties (e.g. waveplates in the case of polarisation), and eventually measured using single-photon detectors. In CV photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic field that take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). Both CV and DV implementations have been realized experimentally; each has a unique set of challenges that need to be overcome to achieve scalable universal photonic quantum computation. It is possible to combine both DV and CV in a hybrid CV-DV fashion to overcome the limitations of either approach.</p>

            <p>We propose efficient algorithms for classically simulating Gaussian unitaries and measurements applied to non-Gaussian initial states. The constructions are based on decomposing the non-Gaussian states into linear combinations of Gaussian states. We use an extension of the covariance matrix formalism to efficiently track relative phases in the superpositions of Gaussian states. We get an exact simulation algorithm, which costs quadratically with the number of Gaussian states required to represent the initial state, and an approximate simulation algorithm, which costs linearly with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficients associated with the superposition. We define measures of non-Gaussianity quantifying this simulation cost, which we call the Gaussian rank and the Gaussian extent. From the perspective of quantum resource theories, we investigate the properties of this type of non-Gaussianity measure and compute optimal decompositions for states relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing.</p>

            <p>The initialization of quantum states or Quantum State Preparation (QSP) is a basic subroutine in quantum algorithms. In the worst case, general QSP algorithms are expensive due to the application of multi-controlled gates required to build the quantum state. Here, we propose an algorithm that detects whether a given quantum state can be factored into substates, increasing the efficiency of compiling the QSP circuit when we initialize states with some level of unentanglement. The simplification is done by eliminating controls of quantum multiplexers, significantly reducing circuit depth and the number of CNOT gates with a better execution and compilation time than the previous QSP algorithms. Considering efficiency in terms of depth and number of CNOT gates, our method is competitive with the methods in the literature. However, when it comes to run-time and compilation efficiency, our result is significantly better, and the experiments show that by increasing the number of qubits, the gap between the temporal efficiency of the methods increases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Bittel, Antonio Anna Mele, Jens Eisert, Lorenzo Leone</p>
            <p>Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.</p>

            <h2>Approximate Degrees of Multisymmetric Properties with Application to Quantum Claw Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiichiro Tani</p>
            <p>The claw problem is central in the fields of theoretical computer science as well as cryptography. The optimal quantum query complexity of the problem is known to be $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ for input functions $f\colon [F]\to Z$ and $g\colon [G]\to Z$. However, the lower bound was proved when the range $Z$ is sufficiently large (i.e., $|{Z}|=\Omega(FG)$). The current paper proves the lower bound holds even for every smaller range $Z$ with $|{Z}|\ge F+G$. This implies that $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ is tight for every such range. In addition, the lower bound $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+F^{1/3}G^{1/6}M^{1/6}\right)$ is provided for even smaller range $Z=[M]$ with every $M\in [2,F+G]$ by reducing the claw problem for $|{Z}|= F+G$. The proof technique is general enough to apply to any $k$-symmetric property (e.g., the $k$-claw problem), i.e., the Boolean function $\Phi$ on the set of $k$ functions with different-size domains and a common range such that $\Phi$ is invariant under the permutations over each domain and the permutations over the range. More concretely, it generalizes Ambainis's argument [Theory of Computing, 1(1):37-46] to the multiple-function case by using the notion of multisymmetric polynomials.</p>

            <p>Quantifying the resources available to a quantum computer appears to be necessary to separate quantum from classical computation. Among them, entanglement, nonstabilizerness and coherence are arguably of great significance. We introduce path coherence as a measure of the coherent paths interferences arising in a quantum computation. Leveraging the sum-over-paths formalism, we obtain a classical algorithm for estimating quantum transition amplitudes, the complexity of which scales with path coherence. As path coherence relates to the hardness of classical estimation of quantum transition amplitudes, it provides a new perspective on the role of coherence in quantum computational advantage. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have practical applications for simulating large classes of quantum computations with classical computers.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the search space of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, can be reduced using Grover adaptive search (GAS) with permutation preparation operator (PPO). To that end, we first revise the traditional quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of the QAP into a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) formulation, introducing a binary encoding method. Algebraic analyses in terms of the number of qubits, quantum gates, circuit depth, and query complexity are performed, which indicate that our proposed approach significantly reduces the search space size, improving convergence performance to the optimal solution compared to the conventional one. Furthermore, although the PPO for HUBO has a greater circuit depth than the PPO for QUBO, when the analysis is extended to the entire state preparation operator, both HUBO and QUBO exhibit comparable depths. Therefore, owing to its smaller number of variables, HUBO can be concluded to be more effective.</p>

            <p>Vibronic interactions between nuclear motion and electronic states are critical for the accurate modeling of photochemistry. However, accurate simulations of fully quantum non-adiabatic dynamics are often prohibitively expensive for classical methods beyond small systems. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm based on product formulas for simulating time evolution under a general vibronic Hamiltonian in real space, capable of handling an arbitrary number of electronic states and vibrational modes. We develop the first trotterization scheme for vibronic Hamiltonians beyond two electronic states and introduce an array of optimization techniques for the exponentiation of each fragment in the product formula, resulting in a remarkably low cost of implementation. To demonstrate practical relevance, we outline a proof-of-principle integration of our algorithm into a materials discovery pipeline for designing more efficient singlet fission-based organic solar cells. We estimate that $100$ fs of propagation using a second-order Trotter product formula for a $6$-state, $21$-mode model of exciton transport at an anthracene dimer requires $154$ qubits and $2.76 \times 10^6$ Toffoli gates.

Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of non-stabilizerness in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in non-stabilizerness at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding complex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum algorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short circuit depth in terms of accuracy $\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all possible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space complexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important challenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general Lindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable estimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a minimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor expansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit compilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump operator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 + \lceil \log M \rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at most $M$ Pauli strings. Furthermore, the gate complexity depends on neither the number of terms in Hamiltonian nor the number of jump operators, owing to the random compilation. This work represents a significant step towards making open quantum system simulations more feasible on early fault-tolerant quantum computing devices.</p>

Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.</p>

Although optimal estimation of certain properties of massive quantum oscillators such as phase shifts and displacements have strict counterparts in the theory of quantum estimation of the electromagnetic field, the phase space anisotropy of the massive oscillator is characterized by a length scale parameter that is an independent target for quantum estimation methods. We show that displaced squeezed states and excited eigenstates of a massive oscillator exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information for the length scale with respect to excitation number, and discuss asymptotically unbiased and efficient estimation allowing to achieve the predicted sensitivity. We construct a sequence of entangled states of two massive oscillators that provides a boost in length scale sensitivity equivalent to appending a third massive oscillator to a non-entangled system, and a state of $N$ oscillators exhibiting Heisenberg scaling with respect to the total energy.</p>

Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum collision models allow for the dynamics of open quantum systems to be described by breaking the environment into small segments, typically consisting of non-interacting harmonic oscillators or two-level systems. This work introduces structure within these environmental units via spring-like interactions between N coupled oscillators in a ring structure, initially prepared in a thermal state. Two models of interest are examined. The first highlights a case in which a continuous time evolution can be obtained, wherein the system interacts with the environment via a beam-splitter-like, energy-preserving, interaction. The resulting dynamics are analogous to those due to interactions with unstructured units prepared as squeezed thermal states. The second model highlights a case in which the continuous time limit for the evolution cannot be taken generally, requiring instead discrete-time propagation. Special cases in which the continuous time limit can be taken are also investigated, alongside the addition of a secondary environment to induce a steady state. The first and second laws of thermodynamics are verified for both examples.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\rho = \min_{\sigma_B} D(\rho_A\otimes \sigma_B\|\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.</p>

            <p>Quantum theory was radically different from the theories of nature which came before it. One key difference was its use of complex numbers. This opened a longstanding debate over whether quantum theory fundamentally requires complex numbers -- or if their use is merely a convenient choice. Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in a 2021 Nature article, a decisive argument was presented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers since real-number quantum theory is inconsistent with the postulates of quantum theory. In this work, we show that this conclusion was premature, and in actual fact, a real-number quantum theory is consistent with the postulates of quantum theory. Our theory retains key features such as representation locality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to the states). A direct consequence of our results is that quantum theory based on real or complex numbers are experimentally indistinguishable.</p>

            <h2>Liouvillian Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Lou Ma, Zexian Guo, Yu Gao, Zlatko Papić, Lei Ying</p>
            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Multiobjective Optimization for Robust Holonomic Quantum Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min-Hua Zhang, Jing Qian</p>
            <p>The practical implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates faces significant challenges in simultaneously mitigating multiple operational errors arising from distinct physical mechanisms. These errors often span orders of magnitude in severity, and their respective suppression strategies may inherently conflict. In this work, we develop a universal multiobjective optimization framework for quantum gate design by integrating Pareto optimal solutions with an entropy-weight method. Using Rydberg-based nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates (affected by amplitude errors, detuning errors, and Rydberg decoherence) as a testbed, we theoretically demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm. The optimized gates exhibit enhanced fidelity and robustness compared to those derived from one-objective optimization strategies. Furthermore, this framework is readily adaptable to other quantum gate protocols and provides a robust foundation for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement between several particles is essential for applications like quantum metrology or quantum cryptography, but it is also central for foundational phenomena like quantum non-locality. This leads to the problem of quantifying the amount of entanglement in a quantum state. We present a review on the geometric measure of entanglement, being a quantifier based on the distance of a state to the nearest separable state. We explain basic properties, existing methods to compute it, its operational interpretations, as well as scaling and complexity issues. We point out intimate relations to fundamental problems in mathematics concerning eigenvalues and norms of tensors. Consequently, the geometric measure of entanglement provides a playground where physical intuition and mathematical rigor benefit from each other.</p>

            <h2>Exponential improvement in quantum simulations of bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masanori Hanada, Shunji Matsuura, Emanuele Mendicelli, Enrico Rinaldi</p>
            <p>Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators, provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous.</p>

            <p>We introduce a general resource indicator, called the bra-ket entanglement, which can be used to bound the resource dependence of classical simulations in the tensor network framework and in the stabilizer formalism. For the tensor network framework, our bounds indicate that bra-ket entanglement governs the interplay between two physical resources, the coherence and the magic. As bra-ket entanglement increases, the dominant resource that governs the complexity of the tensor network framework, quantified by entanglement, shifts from coherence to magic. For the stabilizer formalism approach, we find that magic is always the dominant resource regardless of bra-ket entanglement. This conclusion is obtained by developing an operator stabilizer formalism, which extends the standard stabilizer formalism for pure states and has additional advantages in simulating certain quantum circuits. Therefore, our results indicate that as bra-ket entanglement increases, the resource governing the complexity of the two approaches goes from different to the same.</p>

            <p>While the impact of locality restrictions on quantum dynamics and algorithmic complexity has been well studied in the general case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, the capabilities of time-independent protocols are less well understood. Using clock constructions, we show that the light cone for time-independent Hamiltonians, as captured by Lieb-Robinson bounds, is the same as that for time-dependent systems when local ancillas are allowed. More specifically, we develop time-independent protocols for approximate quantum state transfer with the same run-times as their corresponding time-dependent protocols. Given any piecewise-continuous Hamiltonian, our construction gives a time-independent Hamiltonian that implements its dynamics in the same time, up to error $\varepsilon$, at the cost of introducing a number of local ancilla qubits for each data qubit that is polylogarithmic in the number of qubits, the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivative (if it exists), the run time, and $1/\varepsilon$. We apply this construction to state transfer for systems with power-law-decaying interactions and one-dimensional nearest-neighbor systems with disordered interaction strengths. In both cases, this gives time-independent protocols with the same optimal light-cone-saturating run-times as their time-dependent counterparts.</p>

Furthermore, symmetries of particle physics are naturally reflected in holonomies, making them ideally suited for quantum simulation of quantum chromodynamics and grand unified theories.

We show that multi-particle holonomies can even exist in systems devoid of any single-particle holonomies. We present a comprehensive framework for multi-particle quantum holonomies and experimentally realize various two-particle holonomies in integrated photonics. Our results enable particle number to be harnessed as a design parameter, offering increased freedom in constructing holonomies for quantum computation and simulation.</p>

Here we give a complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</p>

            <h2>Fault Tolerance by Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Rodatz, Boldizsár Poór, Aleks Kissinger</p>
            <p>A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic transformations. To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification. To utilise fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We confirm the improved performance of our optimised circuits in simulation. We anticipate that fault equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhruv Devulapalli, T. C. Mooney, James D. Watson</p>
            <p>Thermalization is the process through which a physical system evolves toward a state of thermal equilibrium. Determining whether or not a physical system will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the Gibbs expectation value is PSPACE-complete. We also show that the related problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the microcanonical expectation value is contained in PSPACE and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. In light of recent results demonstrating undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Trisciani, Marco Cattaneo, Zoltán Zimborás</p>
            <p>Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for implementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates are typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for decomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in account. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing, we develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into single- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries generated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices). Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with identity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result also to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit rotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the layers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based implementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited to qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach yields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based implementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the routing challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited connectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss method, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to optimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.</p>

Here, we introduce a new class of non-Hermitian systems exhibiting pure decay modes-eigenstates with pure, smooth exponential decay, devoid of the oscillatory wave patterns typical of traditional NHSE. Modeled as directed graphs with non-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined as the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel topological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling versatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with complicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices. Experimental validation using microwave resonant circuits confirms the predicted pure decay profiles. This discovery paves the way for potential applications in photonics, signal processing, and beyond, harnessing the unique topological properties of non-Hermitian networks</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey H. Shapiro, Clark Embleton, Michael G. Raymer, Brian J. Smith</p>
            <p>Spontaneous parametric down-converters (SPDCs) are the best available entanglement sources for distributing entanglement in a quantum internet. However, their intrinsically probabilistic nature, and their need to operate at low brightness to suppress multipair events, dictate that multiplexed SPDC arrays are required for high-rate distribution in that application. Early SPDC multiplexing proposals involved path switching, whose switching losses significantly degrade performance. The present paper proposes and analyzes a scheme for spectral multiplexing that provides entanglement-distribution rates well in excess of the state of the art. It builds on zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM)~[Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 19}, 054029 (2023)] for high-rate heralded entanglement generation, which does not require a switched array of SPDCs. Our ZALM's SPDCs rely on nonlinear crystals with $N_I$ phase-matched spectral islands, each generating two-mode squeezed-vacuum states. Also, our ZALM's multiplexing protocol uses both same-island and cross-island heralding, which allows the entanglement-delivery rate to approximately scale as $N_I^2$ in the realistic weak-squeezing regime. As a result, our scheme uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels than the original ZALM proposal, which may enable near-term implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <p>In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc.

Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</p>

Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</p>

            <p>Spin-squeezed states constitute a valuable entanglement resource capable of surpassing the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, spin-squeezed states only enable sub-SQL uncertainty within a narrow parametric window near some specific points. Identifying optimal measurement protocols for spin-squeezed states remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present an adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation protocol that achieves optimal measurement precision with spin-squeezed states under noises. Our protocol operates by maintaining measurements near the optimal point and employing Bayesian inference to sequentially perform phase estimation, enabling robust high-precision measurement. To account for realistic experimental conditions, we explicitly incorporate phase noises into the Bayesian likelihood function for more accurate estimation. Our protocol can be applied to various scenarios, such as quantum gravimeters and atomic clocks, achieving precision enhancement over conventional fitting methods under noises. Our approach offers superior precision and enhanced robustness against noises, making it highly promising for squeezing-enhanced quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliška Postavová, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignano, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-limited optical delay sensing across an enhanced dynamic range by frequency-resolving two-photon interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Russell M. J. Brooks, Luca Maggio, Thomas Jaeken, Joseph Ho, Erik Gauger, Vincenzo Tamma, Alessandro Fedrizzi</p>
            <p>Optical sensing schemes that rely on two-photon interference provide a powerful platform for precision metrology, although they are inherently constrained by a trade-off between dynamic range and measurement precision. To overcome this limitation, we sample the frequencies of two interfering photons, which extends the sensitivity in the time domain. This enhances the dynamic range of optical delay estimation by up to twenty times compared to the non-resolved estimates. We demonstrate this approach with independent photon sources and show the behaviour of finite frequency resolving detectors. This technique enables scan-free nanometre resolution depth sensing over a millimetre-scale range, with applications in biological and nanomaterial imaging.</p>

            <h2>Chiral quantum state circulation from photon lattice topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souvik Bandyopadhyay, Anushya Chandran, Philip JD Crowley</p>
            <p>Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</p>

            <h2>The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the asymmetric thermalization of open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Álvaro Tejero</p>
            <p>The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat-current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the hardness required to achieve proofs of quantumness (PoQ), which in turn capture (potentially interactive) quantum advantage. A ``trivial'' PoQ is to simply assume an average-case hard problem for classical computers that is easy for quantum computers. However, there is much interest in ``non-trivial'' PoQ that actually rely on quantum hardness assumptions, as these are often a starting point for more sophisticated protocols such as classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC). We show several lower-bounds for the hardness required to achieve non-trivial PoQ, specifically showing that they likely require cryptographic hardness, with different types of cryptographic hardness being required for different variations of non-trivial PoQ. In particular, our results help explain the challenges in using lattices to build publicly verifiable PoQ and its various extensions such as CVQC.</p>

            <h2>A New Approach to Arguments of Quantum Knowledge</h2>

            <p>We construct a non-interactive zero-knowledge argument system for QMA with the following properties of interest. 1. Transparent setup. Our protocol only requires a uniformly random string (URS) setup. The only prior (publicly-verifiable) NIZK for QMA (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) requires an entire obfuscated program as the common reference string. 2. Extractability. Valid QMA witnesses can be extracted directly from our accepting proofs. That is, we obtain an argument of knowledge, which was previously only known in a secret parameters model (Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang, CRYPTO 2020). At the heart of our construction is a novel application of the coset state authentication scheme from (Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024) to the setting of QMA verification. Along the way, we establish new properties of the authentication scheme, and design a new type of ZX QMA verifier with ``strong completeness.'' The security of our construction rests on the heuristic use of a post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator. However, rather than rely on the full-fledged classical oracle model (i.e. ideal obfuscation), we isolate a particular game-based property of the obfuscator that suffices for our proof, which we dub the evasive composability heuristic. Going a step further, we show how to replace the heuristic use of an obfuscator with the heuristic use of a hash function (plus sub-exponentially secure functional encryption). We accomplish this by establishing security of the ideal obfuscation scheme of Jain, Lin, Luo, and Wichs (CRYPTO 2023) in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model, which can be heuristically instantiated with a hash function. This result is of independent interest, and allows us to translate several quantum-cryptographic results that were only known in the classical oracle model to results in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model.</p>

            <p>Managing city traffic is a complex NP-hard problem where traditional methods often fail to scale. We present a data-driven approach that reformulates traffic optimization as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization, capturing both congestion reduction and travel-time efficiency. The model integrates simulated realistic mobility data, multiple routing alternatives, and analytically derived penalty constraints. To address large networks, we apply Leiden clustering to preserve critical congestion patterns while reducing problem size. Benchmarking on up to 25,000 vehicles shows that hybrid quantum annealing achieves near-optimal solutions within 1% of the classical solver Gurobi while reducing congestion by up to 25%.</p>

            <h2>Krylov spread complexity as holographic complexity beyond JT gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal P. Heller, Jacopo Papalini, Tim Schuhmann</p>
            <p>One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</p>

            <p>We introduce 1P1Q, a novel quantum data encoding scheme for high-energy physics (HEP), where each particle is assigned to an individual qubit, enabling direct representation of collision events without classical compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 1P1Q in quantum machine learning (QML) through two applications: a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection and a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) for supervised classification of top quark jets. Our results show that the QAE successfully distinguishes signal jets from background QCD jets, achieving superior performance compared to a classical autoencoder while utilizing significantly fewer trainable parameters. Similarly, the VQC achieves competitive classification performance, approaching state-of-the-art classical models despite its minimal computational complexity. Furthermore, we validate the QAE on real experimental data from the CMS detector, establishing the robustness of quantum algorithms in practical HEP applications. These results demonstrate that 1P1Q provides an effective and scalable quantum encoding strategy, offering new opportunities for applying quantum computing algorithms in collider data analysis.</p>

The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Bao, Hao Geng, Yikun Jiang</p>
            <p>We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Topological Mixed States: Phases of Matter from Axiomatic Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai-Hsuan Yang, Bowen Shi, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e., a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: mixed-state bootstrap program. From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges; importantly, these data are robust under relaxation of axioms. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical-demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability: weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Since Berry's pioneering 1984 work, the separation of geometric and dynamic contributions in the {\it phase} of an evolving wave has become fundamental in physics, underpinning diverse phenomena in quantum mechanics, optics, and condensed matter. Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in their expectation values between the input and output wave states. We describe this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry and dynamics in wave scattering and can be applied to a broad range of physical systems.</p>

We provide new support for this analogue by analysing the entanglement of a scalar field in a (1 + 1)-dimensional continuum spacetime with a similar quench, and the harvesting of this entanglement by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We present numerical evidence that the concurrence and mutual information harvested by the detectors are qualitatively similar to those in Rindler spacetime, but they exhibit a small yet noticeable variation when the energy pulse created by the quench crosses the detectors.

            <p>It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective. A brief discussion on current exclusion (for the first time) of very-long axion-cloud lifetimes, through comparison of our results with current LIGO data, as well as potential detection of such effects in future interferometers is also given</p>

The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</p>

            <p>Quantum electrodynamics in strong background fields provides an interesting class of problems for classical and quantum simulation. In this paper we formulate simulations of polarization (helicity) flip for a photon colliding with a high-intensity plane wave. Polarization flip is a one loop effect, which requires addressing new issues that do not arise in simulations of tree-level processes. Working in the momentum-space Fock basis, while convenient for the extraction of scattering amplitudes, requires tuning counterterms to cancel large cutoff effects. We compute analytic formulas for the counterterms at one loop. We then construct circuits for quantum simulations of the process, perform noiseless simulations on classical computers to assess discretization errors, and discuss resource estimates for future simulations on quantum hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abijith Krishnan, Ajesh Kumar, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</p>

            <h2>Rényi and Tsallis information entropies for the Darboux III quantum nonlinear oscillator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Baena-Jimenez, Angel Ballesteros, Ivan Gutierrez-Sagredo, Javier Relancio</p>
            <p>The Darboux III oscillator is an exactly solvable $N$-dimensional nonlinear oscillator defined on a radially symmetric space with non-constant negative curvature. Its one-dimensional version can be seen as a position dependent mass system whose mass function $\mu = (1 + \lambda x^2)$ depends on the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$, such that in the limit $\lambda \to 0$ the harmonic oscillator is recovered. In this paper, a detailed study of the entropic moments and of the Rényi and Tsallis information entropies for the quantum version of the one-dimensional Darboux III oscillator is presented. In particular, analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities in position space are obtained. Since the Fourier transform of the Darboux III wave functions does not admit a closed form expression, a numerical analysis of these quantities has been performed. Throughout the paper the interplay between the entropy parameter $\alpha$ and the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$ is analysed, and known results for the Shannon entropy of the Darboux III and for the Rényi and Tsallis entropies of the harmonic oscillator are recovered in the limits $\alpha \to 1$ and $\lambda \to 0$, respectively. Finally, motivated by the strong non-linear effects arising when large values of $\lambda$ and/or highly excited states are considered, an approximation to the probability density function valid in those regimes is presented. From it, an analytical approximation to the probability density in momentum space can be obtained, and some of the previously observed effects arising from the interplay between $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ can be explained.</p>

            <h2>Layerwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Quantum Clients using Quorus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Han, Nicholas S. DiBrita, Daniel Leeds, Jianqiang Li, Jason Ludmir, Tirthak Patel</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning (QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget, qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on average over the state-of-the-art.</p>

            <h2>A Commuting Hamiltonian Framework for Quantum Time Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas R. Allgood</p>
            <p>We develop a mathematical framework for quantum time transfer based on commuting families of Hamiltonians and synchronization observables. The synchronization subspace is defined as the kernel of a difference operator between local clocks, and we show that this subspace is preserved exactly by a commutative $*$-subalgebra of Hamiltonians compatible with the clocks. Our first main result establishes \emph{perturbative stability}: for $\epsilon$-compatible dynamics, where the commutator with the synchronization operator is bounded in norm by $\epsilon$, we prove quantitative drift bounds showing that timing correlations degrade at most linearly in time with slope proportional to $\epsilon$. Our second main result provides a \emph{representation-theoretic classification}: in the presence of a finite group symmetry, the synchronization subspace coincides with the diagonal isotypic component in the tensor product decomposition, and synchronization preservation is characterized by the commutant algebra of the group action. These results identify synchronization as a structural invariant of operator algebras, connecting approximate commutation, kernel-preserving dynamics, and symmetry protection. Beyond quantum time transfer, the framework suggests categorical and resource-theoretic generalizations and contributes to the broader study of operator-algebraic invariants in multipartite quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Toward Uncertainty-Aware and Generalizable Neural Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Mi, Frank Mueller</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet decoding errors via conventional algorithms result in limited accuracy (i.e., suppression of logical errors) and high overheads, both of which can be alleviated by inference-based decoders. To date, such machine-learning (ML) decoders lack two key properties crucial for practical fault tolerance: reliable uncertainty quantification and robust generalization to previously unseen codes. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{QuBA}, a Bayesian graph neural decoder that integrates attention to both dot-product and multi-head, enabling expressive error-pattern recognition alongside calibrated uncertainty estimates. Building on QuBA, we further develop \textbf{SAGU }\textbf{(Sequential Aggregate Generalization under Uncertainty)}, a multi-code training framework with enhanced cross-domain robustness enabling decoding beyond the training set. Experiments on bivariate bicycle (BB) codes and their coprime variants demonstrate that (i) both QuBA and SAGU consistently outperform the classical baseline belief propagation (BP), achieving a reduction of on average \emph{one order of magnitude} in logical error rate (LER), and up to \emph{two orders of magnitude} under confident-decision bounds on the coprime BB code $[[154, 6, 16]]$; (ii) QuBA also surpasses state-of-the-art neural decoders, providing an advantage of roughly \emph{one order of magnitude} (e.g., for the larger BB code $[[756, 16, \leq34]]$) even when considering conservative (safe) decision bounds; (iii) SAGU achieves decoding performance comparable to or even outperforming QuBA's domain-specific training approach.</p>

            <h2>Asymptotic Vanishing of the Success Probability in Shor's Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João P. da Cruz</p>
            <p>Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -> infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</p>

            <h2>Extended validations on photon number resolving detector based Gaussian boson sampling with low noises</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Ji, Yongzheng Wu, Shi Wang, Jie Hou, Zijian Wang, Bo Jiang</p>
            <p>Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a variety of boson sampling overcoming the stable single-photon preparation difficulty of the later. However, like those in the original version, noises in GBS will also result in the deviation of output patterns and the reduction of classical simulation complexity. We extend the pattern recognition validation, together with the correlation approach as a comparison, on GBS using photon number resolving detectors with noises of both photon loss and distinguishability, to quantificationally evaluate noise levels. As for the classical simulation with noises to be used during validations, it is actually a simulation of mixed states where we employ an existing photon-pair strategy to realize polynomial speedup locally. Furthermore, we use an output-binning strategy to realize validation speedup. Our simulation indicates that the pattern recognition protocol is robust on noise evaluations of GBS even when noises are sufficiently low.</p>

            <h2>Quantum matrix arithmetics with Hamiltonian evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Kang, Yuan Su</p>
            <p>The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</p>

            <p>Certifying random number generators is challenging, especially in security-critical fields like cryptography. Here, we demonstrate a measurement-device-independent quantum random number generator (MDI-QRNG) using high-dimensional photonic path states. Our setup extends the standard qubit beam-splitter QRNG to a three-output version with tunable fiber-optic interferometers acting as tunable beam splitters and superconducting detectors. This setup generates over 1.2 bits per round and 1.77 Mbits per second of certifiably secure private randomness without requiring \emph{any} trust in the measurement apparatus, a critical requirement for the security of real-world cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate certifiably secure high-dimensional quantum random-number generation, paving the way for practical, scalable QRNGs without the need for complex devices.</p>

            <h2>An efficient algorithm to compute entanglement in states with low magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ChunJun Cao, Gong Cheng, Tianci Zhou</p>
            <p>A bottleneck for analyzing the interplay between magic and entanglement is the computation of these quantities in highly entangled quantum many-body magic states. Efficient extraction of entanglement can also inform our understanding of dynamical quantum processes such as measurement-induced phase transition and approximate unitary designs. We develop an efficient classical algorithm to compute the von Neumann entropy and entanglement spectrum for such states under the condition that they have low stabilizer nullity. The algorithm exploits the property of stabilizer codes to separate entanglement into two pieces: one generated by the common stabilizer group and the other from the logical state. The low-nullity constraint ensures both pieces can be computed efficiently. Our algorithm can be applied to study the entanglement in sparsely $T$-doped circuits with possible Pauli measurements as well as certain classes of states that have both high entanglement and magic. Combining with stabilizer learning subroutines, it also enables the efficient learning of von Neumann entropies for low-nullity states prepared on quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum advantage from random geometrically-two-local Hamiltonian dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihui Quek</p>
            <p>Classical hardness-of-sampling results are largely established for random quantum circuits, whereas analog simulators natively realize time evolutions under geometrically local Hamiltonians. Does a typical such Hamiltonian already yield classically-intractable dynamics? We answer this question in the affirmative for the ensemble of geometrically-2-local Hamiltonians with Gaussian coefficients, evolved for constant time. This naturally leads to a quantum advantage scheme with clear prospects for experimental realization, necessitating only course-grained control. We give strong evidence of hardness for this physically-relevant ensemble. We develop the first worst-to-average-case reduction for approximating output probabilities of (time-independent) geometrically-2-local Hamiltonian evolutions. Our reduction proceeds by nonstandard means: while we also leverage polynomial interpolation, unlike previous works, we reduce directly to an evaluator for the exact distribution over Hamiltonians, from which we are trying to prove that sampling is hard. Previous works instead sampled from various perturbations of the true distribution, introducing additional constraints meant to keep the perturbation, measured in total variation distance, under control. We dispense with this step. Our reduction consists in a robust multivariate polynomial interpolation, reduced to sequential robust univariate interpolations via the symmetries of the Gaussian. We circumvent the fact that random Hamiltonians lack a hiding symmetry, a key property in previous proofs. We also contribute an algorithmic version of Berlekamp-Welch to deal with errored evaluations, solving an open problem from the RCS literature. We expect the machinery we develop to find use in average-case Hamiltonian complexity, filling in a gap in this literature which has thus far focussed on worst-case hardness results.</p>

            <h2>Blind quantum computing with different qudit resource state architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alena Romanova, Wolfgang Dür</p>
            <p>We discuss how blind quantum computing generalizes to multi-level quantum systems (qudits), which offers advantages compared to the qubit approach. Here, a quantum computing task is delegated to an untrusted server while simultaneously preventing the server from retrieving information about the computation it performs, the input, and the output, enabling secure cloud-based quantum computing. In the standard approach with qubits, measurement-based quantum computing is used: single-qubit measurements on cluster or brickwork states implement the computation, while random rotations of the resource qubits hide the computation from the server. We generalize finite-sized approximately universal gate sets to prime-power-dimensional qudits and show that qudit versions of the cluster and brickwork states enable a similar server-blind execution of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we compare the overheads of different resource state architectures and discuss which hiding strategies apply to alternative qudit resource states beyond graph states.</p>

            <h2>Classically Sampling Noisy Quantum Circuits in Quasi-Polynomial Time under Approximate Markovianity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan F. Zhang, Su-un Lee, Liang Jiang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in $n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits: (1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate. These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>Networks of sensors are a promising scheme to deliver the benefits of quantum technologies in coming years, offering enhanced precision and accuracy for distributed metrology through the use of large entangled states. Recent work has additionally explored the privacy of these schemes, meaning that local parameters can be kept secret while a joint function of these is estimated by the network. In this work, we use the abstract cryptography framework to relate the two proposed definitions of quasi-privacy, showing that both are composable, which enables the protocol to be securely included as a sub-routine to other schemes. We give an explicit example that estimating the mean of a set of parameters using GHZ states is composably fully secure.</p>

            <h2>Classical simulation of noisy random circuits from exponential decay of correlation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Su-un Lee, Soumik Ghosh, Changhun Oh, Kyungjoo Noh, Bill Fefferman, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>We study the classical simulability of noisy random quantum circuits under general noise models. While various classical algorithms for simulating noisy random circuits have been proposed, many of them rely on the anticoncentration property, which can fail when the circuit depth is small or under realistic noise models. We propose a new approach based on the exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), a measure of tripartite correlations. We prove that exponential CMI decay enables a classical algorithm to sample from noisy random circuits -- in polynomial time for one dimension and quasi-polynomial time for higher dimensions -- even when anticoncentration breaks down. To this end, we show that exponential CMI decay makes the circuit depth effectively shallow, and it enables efficient classical simulation for sampling. We further provide extensive numerical evidence that exponential CMI decay is a universal feature of noisy random circuits across a wide range of noise models. Our results establish CMI decay, rather than anticoncentration, as the fundamental criterion for classical simulability, and delineate the boundary of quantum advantage in noisy devices.</p>

            <p>In quantum many-body systems with kinetically constrained dynamics, the Hilbert space can split into exponentially many disconnected subsectors, a phenomenon known as Hilbert-space fragmentation. We study the interplay of such fragmentation with symmetries, focusing on charge conserving systems with charge conjugation and translation symmetries as a concrete example. The non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented subsectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which can be highly entangled. This algebra also provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures of Hilbert-space fragmentation, such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Tuziemski, J. Pawłowski, P. Tarasiuk, Ł. Pawela, B. Gardas</p>
            <p>We (re)evaluate recent claims of quantum advantage in annealing- and gate-based algorithms, testing whether reported speedups survive rigorous end-to-end runtime definitions and comparison against strong classicalbaselines. Conventional analyses often omit substantial overhead (readout, transpilation, thermalization, etc.) yielding biased assessments. While excluding seemingly not important parts of the simulation may seem reasonable, on most current quantum hardware a clean separation between "pure compute" and "overhead" cannot be experimentally justified. This may distort "supremacy" results. In contrast, for most classical hardware total time $\approx$ compute $+$ a weakly varying constant leading to robust claims. We scrutinize two important milestones: (1) quantum annealing for approximate QUBO [this https URL], which uses a sensible time-to-$\epsilon$ metric but proxies runtime by the annealing time (non-measurable); (2) a restricted Simon's problem [this https URL] , whose advantageous scaling in oracle calls is undisputed; yet, as we demonstrate, estimated runtime of the quantum experiment is $\sim 100 \times$ slower than a tuned classical baseline. Finally, we show that recently claimed "runtime advantage" of the BF-DCQO hybrid algorithm (arXiv:2505.08663) does not withstand rigorous benchmarking. Therefore, we conclude that runtime-based supremacy remains elusive on NISQ hardware, and credible claims require a careful time accounting with a proper reference selections, and an adequate metric.</p>

            <h2>Generalised quantum Sanov theorem revisited</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>Given two families of quantum states $A$ and $B$, called the null and the alternative hypotheses, quantum hypothesis testing is the task of determining whether an unknown quantum state belongs to $A$ or $B$. Mistaking $A$ for $B$ is a type I error, and vice versa for the type II error. In quantum Shannon theory, a fundamental role is played by the Stein exponent, i.e. the asymptotic rate of decay of the type II error probability for a given threshold on the type I error probability. Stein exponents have been thoroughly investigated -- and, sometimes, calculated. However, most currently available solutions apply to settings where the hypotheses simple (i.e. composed of a single state), or else the families $A$ and $B$ need to satisfy stringent constraints that exclude physically important sets of states, such as separable states or stabiliser states. In this work, we establish a general formula for the Stein exponent where both hypotheses are allowed to be composite: the alternative hypothesis $B$ is assumed to be either composite i.i.d. or arbitrarily varying, with components taken from a known base set, while the null hypothesis $A$ is fully general, and required to satisfy only weak compatibility assumptions that are met in most physically relevant cases -- for instance, by the sets of separable or stabiliser states. Our result extends and subsumes the findings of [BBH, CMP 385:55, 2021] (that we also simplify), as well as the 'generalised quantum Sanov theorem' of [LBR, arXiv:2408.07067]. The proof relies on a careful quantum-to-classical reduction via measurements, followed by an application of the results on classical Stein exponents obtained in [Lami, arXiv:today]. We also devise new purely quantum techniques to analyse the resulting asymptotic expressions.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of Noisy Geometrically Local Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Nelson, Joel Rajakumar, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>It has been known for almost 30 years that quantum circuits with interspersed depolarizing noise converge to the uniform distribution at $\omega(\log n)$ depth, where $n$ is the number of qubits, making them classically simulable. We show that under the realistic constraint of geometric locality, this bound is loose: these circuits become classically simulable at even shallower depths. Unlike prior work in this regime, we consider sampling from worst-case circuits and noise of any constant strength. First, we prove that the output distribution of any noisy geometrically local quantum circuit can be approximately sampled from in quasipolynomial time, when its depth exceeds a fixed $\Theta(\log n)$ critical threshold which depends on the noise strength. This scaling in $n$ was previously only obtained for noisy random quantum circuits (Aharonov et. al, STOC 2023). We further conjecture that our bound is still loose and that a $\Theta(1)$-depth threshold suffices for simulability due to a percolation effect. To support this, we provide analytical evidence together with a candidate efficient algorithm. Our results rely on new information-theoretic properties of the output states of noisy shallow quantum circuits, which may be of broad interest. On a fundamental level, we demonstrate that unitary quantum processes in constant dimensions are more fragile to noise than previously understood.</p>

In the process, we more generally establish bounds for learning any linear combination of Hamiltonian coefficients for arbitrary, commuting terms. Our results unify and extend existing bounds for non-interacting qubits and multimode interferometers, providing a general framework for distributed sensing and Hamiltonian learning in realistic many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum hardware increasingly relies on energy reserves that can later be converted into useful work; yet, most battery-like proposals demand coherent drives or engineered non-equilibrium resources, limiting practicality in noisy settings. We develop an autonomous charging paradigm in which an ensemble of identical two-level units, collectively coupled to a thermal environment, acquires work capacity without any external control. The common bath mediates interference between emission and absorption pathways, steering the many-body state away from passivity and into a steady regime with nonzero extractable work. The full charging dynamics and closed-form expressions are obtained for the steady-state, showing favorable scaling with the number of cells that approach the many-body optimum. We show that the mechanism is robust to local noise: under a convex mixture of collective and local dissipation, non-zero steady-state ergotropy persists, exhibits counterintuitive finite-temperature optima, and remains operative when the collective channel is comparable to or stronger than the local one. We show that environmental fluctuations can be harnessed to realize drive-free, scalable quantum batteries compatible with circuit- and cavity-QED platforms. Used as local work buffers, such batteries could potentially enable rapid ancilla reset, bias dissipative stabilizer pumps, and reduce syndrome-extraction overhead in fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Fourier Spectrum of Noisy Quantum Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uma Girish</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise. Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$ algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$, $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>We introduce the novel concept of mereological quantum phase transition (m-QPTs). Our framework is based on a variational family of operator algebras defining generalized tensor product structures (g-TPS), a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian, and a quantum scrambling functional. By minimizing the scrambling functional, one selects a g-TPS, enabling a pullback of the natural information-geometric metric on the g-TPS manifold to the parameter space. The singularities of this induced metric -- so-called algebra susceptibility -- in the thermodynamic limit characterize the m-QPTs. We illustrate this framework through analytical examples involving quantum coherence and operator entanglement. Moreover, spin-chains numerical simulations show susceptibility sharp responses at an integrability point and strong growth across disorder-induced localization, suggesting critical reorganizations of emergent subsystem structure aligned with those transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Karlsson Öhman, Daqing Wang, R. Matthias Geilhufe, Christian Schäfer</p>
            <p>Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Optimal filtering and generation of entangled photons for quantum applications in the presence of noise</h2>

            <p>Filtering is commonly used in quantum optics to reject noise photons, and also to enable interference between independent photons. However, filtering the joint spectrum of photon pairs can reduce the inherent coincidence probability or loss-independent heralding efficiency. Here, we investigate filtering for multiphoton applications based on entanglement and interference (e.g., quantum teleportation). We multiplex C-band entangled photons and C-band classical communications into the same long-distance fibers, which enables scalable low-loss quantum networking but requires filtering of spontaneous Raman scattering noise from classical light. Using tunable-bandwidth filters, low-jitter detectors, and polarization filters, we co-propagate time-bin-entangled photons at wavelengths compatible with erbium-ion quantum memories (1536.5 nm) and 10-Gbps C-band classical data over 25 km/25 km of standard fiber. Narrow filtering enables mW-level C-band power, which exceeds comparable studies by roughly an order of magnitude and could feasibly support Tbps classical rates. We evaluate how performance depends on pump and filter bandwidths, multipair emission, filter shapes, loss, phase matching, and how quantum information is measured. We find a trade-off between improving noise impact and single-mode purity and discuss mitigation methods toward optimal multiphoton applications. Importantly, these results apply to noise in free space and in quantum devices (sources, frequency converters, switches, detectors, etc.) and provide insight on filter-induced degradation of single-photon purity and rates even in noise-free environments.</p>

            <p>Accurate prediction of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) underpins mechanistic insight and the rational design of molecules and materials. We present a systematic, reproducible benchmark comparing quantum and classical machine learning models for BDE prediction using a chemically curated feature set encompassing atomic properties (atomic numbers, hybridization), bond characteristics (bond order, type), and local environmental descriptors. Our quantum framework, implemented in Qiskit Aer on six qubits, employs ZZFeatureMap encodings with variational ansatz (RealAmplitudes) across multiple architectures Variational Quantum Regressors (VQR), Quantum Support Vector Regressors (QSVR), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), and Quantum Random Forests (QRF). These are rigorously benchmarked against strong classical baselines, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Comprehensive evaluation spanning absolute and relative error metrics, threshold accuracies, and error distributions shows that top-performing quantum models (QCNN, QRF) match the predictive accuracy and robustness of classical ensembles and deep networks, particularly within the chemically prevalent mid-range BDE regime. These findings establish a transparent baseline for quantum-enhanced molecular property prediction and outline a practical foundation for advancing quantum computational chemistry toward near chemical accuracy.</p>

            <p>Recent research on excitonic insulator has progressed mainly based on narrow bandgap semiconductor or semimetal. Herein, we realize excitonic insulator based on two-dimensional (2D) wide band gap diamond with transition temperature as high as 220K. The resistance rises dramatically by more than three orders, which can be explained by the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons. While cooling down below transition temperature, the wavelength of the bound excitons caused by boron and nitrogen centers becomes highly overlapped, leading to BEC process. Furthermore, the variable range hopping mechanism is used to simulate the resistance as a function of temperature, which reveals the formation of excitonic insulator. When temperature drops down further, a sudden drop of resistance over three orders was observed around 60K, possibly due to the formation of non-equilibrium excitonic superfluid resulting from highly overlap of wavelength of the large density bound excitons at lower temperature. This study provides evidences for excitonic insulator and possible superfluid phase based on wide bandgap semiconductor.</p>

            <p>We study the existence and limitations for hyperinvariant tensor networks incorporating a local SU(2) symmetry. As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Geometry Codes and Decoded Quantum Interferometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andi Gu, Stephen P. Jordan</p>
            <p>Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) defines a duality that pairs decoding problems with optimization problems. The original work on DQI considered Reed-Solomon decoding, whose dual optimization problem, called Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a finite field. Here, we consider a class of algebraic geometry codes called Hermitian codes, which achieve block length $q^3$ using alphabet $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ compared to Reed-Solomon's limitation to block length $q$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, requiring approximately one-third fewer qubits per field element for quantum implementations. We show that the dual optimization problem, which we call Hermitian Optimal Polynomial Intersection (HOPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a Hermitian curve, and because the dual to a Hermitian code is another Hermitian code, the HOPI problem can also be viewed as approximate list recovery for Hermitian codes. By comparing to Prange's algorithm, simulated annealing, and algebraic list recovery algorithms, we find a large parameter regime in which DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation than these classical algorithms, suggesting that the apparent quantum speedup offered by DQI extends beyond Reed-Solomon codes to a broader class of polynomial regression problems on algebraic varieties.</p>

            <p>We apply the combined technique of postselected amplification and photon-recycling to an optical setup of magnetic field precision measurement. We propose two recycling schemes and carry out analytic expressions for the amplified signal and measurement sensitivity. The results show significant improvement of performance over conventional measurement. The underlying reason is twofold. On one aspect, introducing the technique of recycling eliminates the shortcoming of data discarding in postselection, thus maintains similar noise level of conventional measurement (without postselection). On the other aspect, performing intentional postselection within the recycling framework, which was originally proposed in the context of gravitational wave detection, can amplify the signal. Thus, the measurement signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shouzhen Gu, Libor Caha, Shin Ho Choe, Zhiyang He, Aleksander Kubica, Eugene Tang</p>
            <p>We investigate layer codes, a family of three-dimensional stabilizer codes that can achieve optimal scaling of code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier, as candidates for self-correcting quantum memories. First, we introduce two decoding algorithms for layer codes with provable guarantees for local stochastic and adversarial noise, respectively. We then prove that layer codes constitute partially self-correcting quantum memories which outperform previously analyzed models such as the cubic code and the welded solid code. Notably, we argue that partial self-correction without the requirement of efficient decoding is more common than expected, as it arises solely from a diverging energy barrier. This draws a sharp distinction between partially self-correcting systems and partially self-correcting memories. Another novel aspect of our work is an analysis of layer codes constructed from random Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes. We show that these random layer codes have optimal scaling (up to logarithmic corrections) of code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier. Finally, we present numerical studies of their memory times and report behavior consistent with partial self-correction.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the importance of symmetries in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms to prepare the ground or specific low-lying states of quantum Hamiltonians. We examine two spin problems, one with random all-to-all couplings inspired by neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae, and the standard Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian on a $4 \times 3$ lattice. The neutrino Hamiltonian has the total spin $J$ and third component $J_{\rm{z}}$ as its only symmetries. The Heisenberg model has these symmetries plus translational invariance and reflection symmetry. We demonstrate that the convergence of variational methods is dramatically improved by keeping all symmetries. In both cases a nearly exact solution can be obtained in cases where standard unconstrained variational algorithms fail. Since variational algorithms can use standard Trotter steps as part of the optimization, allowing additional correlations that obey all the symmetries of the Hamiltonian will speed convergence of variational algorithms. This will lead to faster convergence than standard projection algorithms.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme to generate holonomies using the Quantum Zeno effect, enabling logical unitary operations on quantum stabilizer codes purely through measurements. The quantum error-correcting code space is adiabatically rotated by measuring a succession of rotated stabilizer generators. When the rotation is sufficiently slow, the state remains confined to the instantaneous code space by the Zeno effect; otherwise, measurement-induced jumps can occur into a rotated orthogonal subspace. If the rotation completes a closed loop, the code state is transformed by a holonomy: a logical unitary transformation. We analytically derive the sequence of rotated stabilizer generators that produce a desired holonomy, and find the total time required to implement this procedure with a given success probability. If a measurement moves the state to the orthogonal subspace, we present a method to alter the path of the rotated observables to return the state either to the original code or the original error space with the desired holonomy; in the latter case, the holonomy is emulated. Finally, we establish conditions on the code and the measured observables that preserve the correctability of a given error set. When a code fails to meet the error-correcting conditions, our protocol remains applicable by augmenting the code with at most two ancilla qubits.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Global Entanglement-Distillation Policies in Quantum Repeater Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iftach Yakar, Michael Ben-Or</p>
            <p>Quantum repeaters are essential for achieving long-distance quantum communication due to photon loss, which grows exponentially with the channel distance. Current quantum repeater generations use entanglement distillation protocols, where the decision of when to perform distillation depends on either local or global knowledge. Recent approaches for quantum repeaters, such as Mantri et al. (arXiv:2409.06152), consider using deterministic local decision policies for entanglement distillation. We ask whether global deterministic policies outperform local ones in terms of communication rate. We simulate equidistant repeater chains, assisted by two-way classical communication, and compare local and global policies for distillation decisions, spanning large distances and varying network and hardware parameters. Our findings show that global deterministic policies consistently outperform these local ones, and in some cases, determine whether secret communication is possible. For large repeater chains ($N>512$), global policies improve SKR by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that local distillation decisions in quantum repeater chains may not be optimal, and may inform future protocol design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong-Xia Shang, Naixu Guo, Patrick Rebentrost, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Tongyang Li, Qi Zhao</p>
            <p>Quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Lindbladian dynamics are both foundational in quantum information science and central to quantum algorithm design. In this work, we bridge these two concepts: certain simple Lindbladian processes can be adapted to perform QPE-type tasks. However, unlike QPE, which achieves Heisenberg-limit scaling, these Lindbladian evolutions are restricted to standard quantum limit complexity. This indicates that, different from Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$ within an error $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost, whose mechanism is fundamentally different from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of dissipative dynamics. We also adopt our fast-forwarding algorithm for efficient Gibbs state preparation and demonstrate the counter-intuitive implication: the allowance of a quadratically accelerated decoherence effect under arbitrary Pauli noise.</p>

            <p>It is a major challenge to perform addressable and parallel logical operations on constant-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes. Indeed, the overhead of targeting specific logical qubits represents a crucial bottleneck in many quantum fault-tolerance schemes. We introduce fault-tolerant protocols for performing various addressable as well as parallel logical operations with constant space-time overhead, on a family of constant-rate and polynomial-distance qLDPC codes. Specifically, we construct gadgets for a large class of permutations of logical qubits. We apply these logical permutations to construct gadgets for applying a targeted Hadamard (or $CNOT$) gate on any chosen logical qubit (pair). We also construct gadgets for preparing logical code states, and for applying Hadamard gates on all logical qubits in a codeblock. All of our gadgets use constant quantum space-time overhead along with polynomially bounded classical computation. Prior protocols for such operations required larger overhead, or else relied on codes with certain symmetries that lack known asymptotic constructions. Our codes are given by tensor products of classical codes constructed from lossless expander graphs. Our core technical contribution is a constant-overhead code-switching procedure between 2- and 3-dimensional product codes, which generalizes Bombin's dimensional jump (arXiv:1412.5079). We prove that all of our gadgets exhibit a constant threshold under locally stochastic noise. Along the way, we develop a small-set flip decoder for high-dimensional product codes from lossless expanders. Our techniques yield additional interesting consequences, such as single-shot state preparation of 2-dimensional product codes with constant space-time overhead. We also propose a method for performing parallel non-Clifford gates by extending our techniques to codes supporting transversal application of such gates.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are prominent candidates for near-term quantum advantage but lack rigorous guarantees of convergence and generalization. By contrast, quantum phase estimation (QPE) provides provable performance under the guiding state assumption, where access to a state with non-trivial overlap with the ground state enables efficient energy estimation. In this work, we ask whether similar guarantees can be obtained for VQAs. We introduce a variational quantum algorithm with guiding states aiming towards predicting ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. We then develop a proof technique-the linearization trick-that maps the training dynamics of the algorithm to those of a kernel model. This connection yields the first theoretical guarantees on both convergence and generalization for the VQA under the guiding state assumption. Our analysis shows that guiding states accelerate convergence, suppress finite-size error terms, and ensure stability across system dimensions. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on 2D random Heisenberg models.</p>

            <p>Classical simulation of quantum circuits is a critical tool for validating quantum hardware and probing the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Existing state-of-the-art methods, notably tensor network approaches, have computational costs governed by the treewidth of the underlying circuit graph, making circuits with large treewidth intractable. This work rigorously analyzes FeynmanDD, a decision diagram-based simulation method proposed in CAV 2025 by a subset of the authors, and shows that the size of the multi-terminal decision diagram used in FeynmanDD is exponential in the linear rank-width of the circuit graph. As linear rank-width can be substantially smaller than treewidth and is at most larger than the treewidth by a logarithmic factor, our analysis demonstrates that FeynmanDD outperforms all tensor network-based methods for certain circuit families. We also show that the method remains efficient if we use the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm to expand arbitrary single-qubit gates to sequences of Hadamard and T gates, essentially removing the gate-set restriction posed by the method.</p>

To this end, we study the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Golowich, Venkatesan Guruswami</p>
            <p>It is a major challenge to construct good quantum codes supporting fault-tolerant (e.g. transversal) non-Clifford gates with low-weight parity-check measurements. In this paper, we construct the first known quantum codes with linear dimension and distance supporting transversal non-Clifford gates that have sublinear locality (i.e. parity-check weight). Specifically, we construct codes with transversal $CCZ$ gates that have dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ denotes the block length. We furthermore design an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes. The alphabet size of these codes is $q=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$, but it can be reduced to a constant (e.g. $q=2$) while incurring a polylogarithmic loss in other parameters. We also show how to decrease the locality to $O(N^{1/3})$, albeit with a larger alphabet size and slightly lower distance. We construct these codes as products of classical codes with appropriate algebraic structure. While our quantum codes are subsystem codes with non-commuting gauge operators, we show they nevertheless permit error correction from noisy syndrome measurements. As byproducts, we prove multiple technical results of independent interest. In particular, our efficient decoder can be viewed as a new multivariate generalization of Prony's method for reconstructing a function from partial access to its Fourier transform. Meanwhile, our distance analysis involves new connections to the classical study of maximally recoverable codes. Our results on product codes also resolve a conjecture of Bravyi & Hastings (2014) in the large-alphabet regime, by providing a new construction of quantum codes with dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $N^\epsilon$ for arbitrary $\epsilon>0$.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic pathway for solving differential equations within the quantum linear systems framework by combining block encoding with Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The approach is demonstrated on a complex tridiagonal linear system and extended to problems in computational fluid dynamics: the heat equation with mixed boundary conditions and the nonlinear Burgers' equation. Our scaling analysis of the heat equation shows how discretization influences the minimum singular value and the polynomial degree required for QSVT, identifying circuit-depth overhead as a key bottleneck. For Burgers' equation, we illustrate how Carleman-linearized nonlinear dynamics can be efficiently block encoded and solved within the QSVT framework. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of current methods, underscoring the need for efficient estimation of minimum singular value, depth-reduction techniques, and benchmarks against classical reachability. This pathway lays a foundation for advancing quantum linear system methods toward large-scale applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Allcock, Joao F. Doriguello, Gábor Ivanyos, Miklos Santha</p>
            <p>Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d > 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$: 1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples; 2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples; 3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples; 4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states; 5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.</p>

            <p>We introduce the first randomized algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework for many quantum algorithms. Standard implementations of QSVT rely on block encodings of the Hamiltonian, which are costly to construct, requiring a logarithmic number of ancilla qubits, intricate multi-qubit control, and circuit depth scaling linearly with the number of Hamiltonian terms. In contrast, our algorithms use only a single ancilla qubit and entirely avoid block encodings. We develop two methods: (i) a direct randomization of QSVT, where block encodings are replaced by importance sampling, and (ii) an approach that integrates qDRIFT into the generalized quantum signal processing framework, with the dependence on precision exponentially improved through classical extrapolation. Both algorithms achieve gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, a hallmark of randomized methods, while incurring only quadratic dependence on the degree of the target polynomial. We identify natural parameter regimes where our methods outperform even standard QSVT, making them promising for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We also establish a fundamental lower bound showing that the quadratic dependence on the polynomial degree is optimal within this framework. We apply our framework to two fundamental tasks: solving quantum linear systems and estimating ground-state properties of Hamiltonians, obtaining polynomial advantages over prior randomized algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our ground-state property estimation algorithm on electronic structure Hamiltonians and the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. In both cases, our approach outperforms prior work by several orders of magnitude in circuit depth, establishing randomized QSVT as a practical and resource-efficient alternative for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Mirrored Entanglement Witnesses for Multipartite and High-Dimensional Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiheon Seong, Anindita Bera, Beatrix C. Hiesmayr, Dariusz Chruscinski, Joonwoo Bae</p>
            <p>Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a versatile tool to detect entangled states and characterize related properties of entanglement in quantum information theory. A witness $W$ corresponds to an observable satisfying $\mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0$ for all separable states $\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}$; entangled states are detected once the inequality is violated. Recently, mirrored EWs have been introduced by showing that there exist non-trivial upper bounds to EWs, \begin{eqnarray} u_W\geq \mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0. \nonumber \end{eqnarray} An upper bound to a witness $W$ signifies the existence of the other one $M$, called a mirrored EW, such that $W+M = u_W I \otimes I$. The framework of mirrored EWs shows that a single EW can be even more useful, as it can detect a larger set of entangled states by lower and upper bounds. In this work, we develop and investigate mirrored EWs for multipartite qubit states and also for high-dimensional systems, to find the efficiency and effectiveness of mirrored EWs in detecting entangled states. We provide mirrored EWs for $n$-partite GHZ states, graph states such as two-colorable states, and tripartite bound entangled states. We also show that optimal EWs can be reflected with each other. For bipartite systems, we present mirrored EWs for existing optimal EWs and also construct a mirrored pair of optimal EWs in dimension three. Finally, we generalize mirrored EWs such that a pair of EWs can be connected by another EW, i.e., $W+M =K$ is also an EW. Our results enhance the capability of EWs to detect a larger set of entangled states in multipartite and high-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>On the emergence of quantum Darwinism and pointer states for non-commuting evolutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana A. Chisholm, G. Massimo Palma, Luca Innocenti</p>
            <p>Quantum systems achieve objectivity by redundantly encoding information about themselves into the surrounding environment, through a mechanism known as quantum Darwinism. When this happens, observes measure the environment and infer the system to be in one of its pointer states. We study the emergence of objectivity whenever the Hamiltonian of the system and the interaction Hamiltonian between system and environment do not commute, a condition which is thought to be incompatible with the presence of pointer states. We show that, not only non-commuting evolutions allow for the emergence of objective states, but it is possible to give a more relaxed definition of pointer states, that is always well defined whenever there is redundancy of information, and coincides with the usual one for commuting evolutions.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing that incorporates strong single-photon nonlinearities into a photonic GHZ-measurement-based architecture. The nonlinearities substantially reduce resource overheads compared to conventional linear-optics-based architectures, which require significant redundancy to accommodate probabilistic photon generation and probabilistic entangling operations. By removing linear-optical failure modes, our nonlinear architecture can also tolerate much higher optical losses than linear approaches, with a baseline loss tolerance of $\sim$12\% using a 32-photon resource state and a foliated surface code. Our results show how introducing a nonlinear primitive enables dramatic improvements in practical implementations of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing LOCC Protocols on Product Stiefel Manifold</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Tong Li, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Local operations and classical communication (LOCC) is a foundational framework in quantum information from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. However, designing and optimizing LOCC protocols is intractable due to their complex structure. Determining achievable bounds and designing practically implementable LOCC protocols remain crucial challenges when the number of communication rounds is finite. In this work, we develop a framework to optimize fixed-round LOCC via Riemannian optimization on the product Stiefel manifold, which not only yields near-optimal objective function values but also produces fully implementable protocols. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework through key tasks in quantum information processing, such as entanglement distillation and state merging. Our results provide new insights into the achievable bounds for entanglement distillation and block entanglement state merging. We obtain improved distillation and state merging protocols, some of which match the upper bounds derived via positive partial transpose relaxations. These results demonstrate that optimizing LOCC via manifold optimization can serve as a powerful tool to advance research on distributed quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulio Malavolta</p>
            <p>Foundational results in theoretical computer science have established that everything provable, is provable in zero knowledge. However, this assertion fundamentally assumes a classical interpretation of computation and many interesting physical statements that one can hope to prove are not characterized. In this work, we consider decision problems, where the problem instance itself is specified by a (pure) quantum state. We discuss several motivating examples for this notion and, as our main technical result, we show that every quantum problem that is provable with an interactive protocol, is also provable in zero-knowledge. Our protocol achieves unconditional soundness and computational zero-knowledge, under standard assumptions in cryptography. In addition, we show how our techniques yield a protocol for the Uhlmann transformation problem that achieves a meaningful notion of zero-knowledge, also in the presence of a malicious verifier.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Sparse Recovery and Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armando Bellante, Stefano Vanerio, Stefano Zanero</p>
            <p>We study quantum sparse recovery in non-orthogonal, overcomplete dictionaries: given coherent quantum access to a state and a dictionary of vectors, the goal is to reconstruct the state up to $\ell_2$ error using as few vectors as possible. We first show that the general recovery problem is NP-hard, ruling out efficient exact algorithms in full generality. To overcome this, we introduce Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QOMP), the first quantum analogue of the classical OMP greedy algorithm. QOMP combines quantum subroutines for inner product estimation, maximum finding, and block-encoded projections with an error-resetting design that avoids iteration-to-iteration error accumulation. Under standard mutual incoherence and well-conditioned sparsity assumptions, QOMP provably recovers the exact support of a $K$-sparse state in polynomial time. As an application, we give the first framework for sparse quantum tomography with non-orthogonal dictionaries in $\ell_2$ norm, achieving query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N}/\epsilon)$ in favorable regimes and reducing tomography to estimating only $K$ coefficients instead of $N$ amplitudes. In particular, for pure-state tomography with $m=O(N)$ dictionary vectors and sparsity $K=\widetilde{O}(1)$ on a well-conditioned subdictionary, this circumvents the $\widetilde{\Omega}(N/\epsilon)$ lower bound that holds in the dense, orthonormal-dictionary setting, without contradiction, by leveraging sparsity together with non-orthogonality. Beyond tomography, we analyze QOMP in the QRAM model, where it yields polynomial speedups over classical OMP implementations, and provide a quantum algorithm to estimate the mutual incoherence of a dictionary of $m$ vectors in $O(m/\epsilon)$ queries, improving over both deterministic and quantum-inspired classical methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandra Colla, Bassano Vacchini, Andrea Smirne</p>
            <p>Understanding how to assign internal energy, heat, and work in quantum systems beyond weak coupling remains a central problem in quantum thermodynamics, particularly as the difference between competing definitions becomes increasingly relevant. We identify two common sets of definitions for first-law quantities that are used to describe the thermodynamics of quantum systems coupled to thermal environments. Both are conceptually non-symmetric, treating one part of the bipartition (the "system") differently from the other (the "bath"). We analyze these in a setting where such roles are not easily assigned - two large (but finite) sets of thermal harmonic oscillators interacting with each other. We further compare them with a third set of definitions based on a local, conceptually symmetric open-system approach ("minimal dissipation") and discuss their quantitative and structural differences. In particular, we observe that all three sets of definitions differ substantially even when the two subsystems are weakly coupled and far detuned, and that the minimal dissipation approach features distinct work peaks that increase with the coupling strength.</p>

            <p>The aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum fusion mechanism for multimodal learning and to establish its theoretical and empirical potential. The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks, with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum information processing in spin-based architectures necessitates the a bility to reliably shuttle quantum states across extended device regions with minimal decoherence. In this work, we present a physics-informed algorithm for optimizing electrostatic bias equences that enable conveyor-mode electron transport in silicon-based quantum dot devices. Our approach combines self-consistent Poisson and Schrodinger solvers to maintain a constant ground state energy and enable near-constant velocity shuttling, with potential applicability to both single-electron and hole transport. We validate the algorithm across three representative technologies: Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FD-SOI), Silicon Metal-Oxide-Seminconductor (SiMOS) and Silicon-Germanium Heterostracture (Si/SiGe), highlighting key limitations and material-specific effects that influence transport fidelity. Our findings underscore the impact of gate geometry, dielectric interfaces, and quantum dot size on the stability of shuttling operations, and offer pathways toward improving coherence preservation in large-scale quantum systems.</p>

We employ the Partitioned Unitary Quantum Cellular Automaton (PUQCA), a number-conserving model, and, via evolutionary search, find solutions to the DCT where the success condition is stipulated in terms of measurement probabilities rather than convergence to fixed-point configurations. Finally, we identify a classically simulable regime of the PUQCA in which we find rules that solve the DCT at fixed system sizes and analyze their performance.</p>

            <p>Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</p>

            <p>We show the existence of an MA-complete homology problem for a certain subclass of simplicial complexes. The problem is defined through a new concept of orientability of simplicial complexes that we call a "uniform orientable filtration", which is related to sign-problem freeness in homology. The containment in MA is achieved through the design of new, higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes associated with the filtration. For the MA-hardness, we design a new gadget with which we can reduce from an MA-hard stoquastic satisfiability problem. Therefore, our result provides the first natural MA-complete problem for higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes, combining the concepts of topology, persistent homology, and quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Duality theorems play a fundamental role in convex optimization. Recently, it was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs, respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al., POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).</p>

Our imaging system achieves a resolution of 1.1 {\mu}m and a field-of-view of 2.5 mm. The system requires no movable parts at cryogenic temperatures and features a large working distance, thereby allowing optical and microwave probe access, as well as direct anchoring of temperature sensitive samples to a cold finger, needed for applications with high thermal load.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takao Tomono, Kazuya Tsujimura</p>
            <p>Maintenance of production equipment is critical in manufacturing. Typically, machine learning models are trained on sensor data closely attached to equipment. However, as the number of machines increases, computational cost grows rapidly. In practice, anomalies are often identified by human operators through auditory perception, relying heavily on experience and intuition. In vibration analysis, especially, AR model coefficients combined with one-class SVMs are used for detecting anomalies. In this work, we explore the effect of substituting the classical kernel in the one-class SVM with a quantum kernel. Two experimental setups were used. The first involved a miniature racing car track, where the car passes over a patch of hook-and-loop fastener to generate abnormal sounds, which are recorded using a microphone. The second involved an open-belt drive, where chopsticks are inserted at specific times to produce crushing sounds, simulating sudden anomalies. Our results show a clear advantage of quantum kernels over classical Gaussian (RBF) kernels. On the miniature car track dataset, the quantum kernel achieved an accuracy and F1-score of 0.82, compared to 0.64 and 0.39 respectively for the RBF kernel. For the crushing device, the quantum kernel achieved perfect accuracy and F1-score (1.00), while the RBF kernel reached only 0.64 accuracy and 0.43 F1-score. These findings suggest that quantum kernels enhance the classification accuracy for diverse types of abnormal sound patterns, including both periodic and impulsive anomalies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Qiao, Zu-Jian Ying</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to implement Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in a hybrid cavity optomechanical-spin system. In our system, $N$ two-level systems are coupled via Tavis-Cummings interactions to a mechanical resonator (MR) in a standard optomechanical setup. Within the dispersive coupling regime, adiabatic elimination of the optical mode induces a squeezing effect on the MR, which, in the squeezed representation, effectively transforms the collective spin operators into a Bogoliubov form. Under large detuning conditions, the phonon mode mediates interactions among the Bogoliubov collective spins, thereby enabling a two-axis twisting squeezing protocol through appropriate parameter tuning. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that in the presence of dephasing and phonon dissipation, the maximum squeezing degree asymptotically converges to a constant as $N$ increases, which implies the metrological precision asymptotically approaches the standard quantum limit without parameter optimization. Nevertheless, in parameter optimization we extract a scaling relation of the optimal squeezing which surpasses existing schemes in the literature. Moreover, the optimization also leads to a considerable reduction of the preparation time for the optimal squeezing. Our work may provide insights into dissipation effects in spin squeezing and offer a potential route for high-precision quantum metrology in many-body systems.</p>

By using this circuit decomposition, we propose a parametrized quantum comb with group symmetry, and derive the optimal quantum comb which transforms an unknown unitary operation $U \in \mathrm{SU}(d)$ to its inverse $U^\dagger$ or transpose $U^\top$. From numerics, we find a deterministic and exact unitary transposition protocol for $d=3$ with $7$ queries to $U$. This protocol improves upon the protocol shown in the previous work, which requires $13$ queries to $U$.</p>

HPQEA includes three main features: a high-performance computing core, an optimized controlled-NOT gate computation strategy, and effective utilization of high-bandwidth memory. Verification and evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error. It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution, supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources. Furthermore, it exceeds the Nvidia A100 in normalized gate speed for systems with up to 20 qubits.

What are the minimal communication resources Alice must use in order to achieve information-theoretic security? In this paper, we consider a single step of the protocol, where Alice conveys to Bob whether or not he should implement a specific gate. We use an entropy-bounding technique to quantify the minimum number of qubits that Alice must send so that Bob cannot learn anything about the gate being implemented. We provide a protocol that saturates this bound. In this optimal protocol, the states that Alice sends may be entangled. For Clifford gates, we prove that it is sufficient for Alice to send separable states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Rippchen, Ludovico Lami, Gerardo Adesso, Mario Berta</p>
            <p>Sending quantum information reliably over long distances is a central challenge in quantum technology in general, and in quantum optics in particular, since most quantum communication relies on optical fibres or free-space links. Here, we address this problem by shifting the focus from the quantity of information sent to the quality of the transmission, i.e. the rate of decay of the transmission error with respect to the number of channel uses. For the general class of teleportation-simulable channels, which includes all channels arising in quantum optical communication, we prove that the single-letter reverse relative entropy of entanglement of the Choi state upper bounds the error exponent of two-way assisted quantum communication - paralleling the celebrated capacity bound of [Pirandola et al., Nat. Comm. (2017)] in terms of the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Remarkably, for Gaussian channels our bound can be computed efficiently through a convex program with simple constraints involving only finite-dimensional covariance matrices. As a prototypical application, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for several one-mode Gaussian channels that are fundamental to optical communication. Extending recent work [Lami et al., arXiv:2408.07067 (2024)] to infinite-dimensional systems, we further endow the reverse relative entropy of entanglement with an exact operational interpretation in entanglement testing, and show that it characterises the rate of entanglement distillation under non-entangling operations. These findings offer a new perspective on entanglement as a resource and sharpen the theoretical benchmarks for future quantum optical networks.</p>

            <p>We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Experimental demonstration of genuine quantum information transmission through completely depolarizing channels in a superposition of cyclic orders</h2>

            <p>A major challenge in quantum communication is addressing the negative effects of noise on channel capacity, especially for completely depolarizing channels, where information transmission is inherently impossible. The concept of indefinite causal order provides a promising solution by allowing control over the sequence in which channels are applied. We experimentally demonstrate the activation of quantum communication through completely depolarizing channels using a programmable silicon photonic quantum chip. By implementing configurations based on the superposition of cyclic orders, a form of indefinite causal order, we report the first experimental realization of genuine quantum information transmission across multiple concatenated completely depolarizing channels. Our results show that when four completely depolarizing channels are combined using the superposition of cyclic orders, the fidelity of the output state is $0.712 \pm 0.013$, significantly exceeding the classical threshold of 2/3. Our work establishes indefinite causal order as a powerful tool for overcoming noise-induced limitations in quantum communication, demonstrating its potential in high-noise environments and opening new possibilities for building robust quantum networks.</p>

            <p>The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated supercon- ducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.</p>

            <p>We study the error correcting properties of Haar random codes, in which a $K$-dimensional code space $\boldsymbol{C} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^N$ is chosen at random from the Haar distribution. Our main result is that Haar random codes can approximately correct errors up to the quantum Hamming bound, meaning that a set of $m$ Pauli errors can be approximately corrected so long as $mK \ll N$. This is the strongest bound known for any family of quantum error correcting codes (QECs), and continues a line of work showing that approximate QECs can significantly outperform exact QECs [LNCY97, CGS05, BGG24]. Our proof relies on a recent matrix concentration result of Bandeira, Boedihardjo, and van Handel.</p>

            <h2>MIPco=coRE</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junqiao Lin</p>
            <p>In 2020, a landmark result by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen showed that MIP*, the class of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier interacting with multiple computationally unbounded provers sharing entanglement in the tensor product model, is equal to RE. We show that the class MIPco, a complexity class defined similarly to MIP* except with provers sharing the commuting operator model of entanglement, is equal to the class coRE. This shows that giving the provers two different models of entanglement leads to two completely different computational powers for interactive proof systems. Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of MIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that the same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property in the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the compression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous framework used by Mousavi et al. [STOC 2022], as well as the improved Pauli basis test introduced by de la Salle [arXiv:2204.07084]. We introduce a new equivalence condition for RE/coRE-complete problems, which we call the weakly compressible condition. We show that both MIP* and MIPco satisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish that the uncomputability for MIP* and MIPco can be proved under a unified framework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this approach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP*=RE theorem, which does not rely on the preservation of the entanglement bound. In addition to non-local games, this new condition could also potentially be applicable to other decision problems.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of Clifford testing, which asks whether a black-box $n$-qubit unitary is a Clifford unitary or at least $\varepsilon$-far from every Clifford unitary. We give the first 4-query Clifford tester, which decides this problem with probability $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$. This contrasts with the minimum of 6 copies required for the closely-related task of stabilizer testing. We show that our tester is tolerant, by adapting techniques from tolerant stabilizer testing to our setting. In doing so, we settle in the positive a conjecture of Bu, Gu and Jaffe, by proving a polynomial inverse theorem for a non-commutative Gowers 3-uniformity norm. We also consider the restricted setting of single-copy access, where we give an $O(n)$-query Clifford tester that requires no auxiliary memory qubits or adaptivity. We complement this with a lower bound, proving that any such, potentially adaptive, single-copy algorithm needs at least $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ queries. To obtain our results, we leverage the structure of the commutant of the Clifford group, obtaining several technical statements that may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya Sriram, Vedika Khemani, Benedikt Placke</p>
            <p>Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Costs of Noise-Robust Quantum Control: Speed Limits and Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junkai Zeng, Xiu-Hao Deng</p>
            <p>Noise is ubiquitous in quantum systems and is a major obstacle for the advancement of quantum information science. Noise-robust quantum control achieves high-fidelity operations by engineering the evolution path so that first-order noise contributions cancel at the final time. Such dynamical error correction typically incurs a time overhead beyond standard quantum speed limits. We derive general lower bounds on control complexity that quantify this overhead for quasi-static coherent noise under bounded control amplitude. For a single noise source, we prove a universal time lower bound for first-order robustness and give a constructive scheme that implements any target gate robustly in time 4T plus a constant time. For robustness against an entire noise space, we show dimension lower bounds on the number M of segments in any mixed-unitary schedule from two mechanism: (i) a coherent dimension bound when the error subspace contains an irreducible block isomorphic to su(q), and (ii) a projection dimension bound when the noise space contains the trace-zero span of orthogonal projectors. Under bounded speed, these bounds on number of segments imply time lower bounds. With only local controls robust against noise space defined on a graph, we obtain a graph-orthogonality time bound scales linear with graph chromatic number. We illustrate the bounds through examples. Collectively, these results establish quantitative limitations on the feasibility of first-order noise-resilient operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Anand, Matthias C. Caro, Ari Karchmer, Saachi Mutreja</p>
            <p>Quantum learning from remotely accessed quantum compute and data must address two key challenges: verifying the correctness of data and ensuring the privacy of the learner's data-collection strategies and resulting conclusions. The covert (verifiable) learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC 2021) provides a framework for endowing classical learning algorithms with such guarantees. In this work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learning theory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remote data access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. We consider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii) target-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the unknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for making quantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms for learning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantum statistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learning from public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and for solving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and private classical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d. ancilla-free eavesdropper. The lattermost results in particular establish that the exponential separation between classical and quantum queries for Forrelation and Simon's problem survives under covertness constraints. Along the way, we design covert verifiable protocols for quantum data acquisition from public quantum queries which may be of independent interest. Overall, our models and corresponding algorithms demonstrate that quantum advantages are privately and verifiably achievable even with untrusted, remote data.</p>

            <p>Fault-tolerant Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) promise to deliver exponential speed-ups in select computational tasks, yet their integration into modern deep learning pipelines remains unclear. In this work, we take a step towards bridging this gap by presenting the first fully-coherent quantum implementation of a multilayer neural network with non-linear activation functions. Our constructions mirror widely used deep learning architectures based on ResNet, and consist of residual blocks with multi-filter 2D convolutions, sigmoid activations, skip-connections, and layer normalizations. We analyse the complexity of inference for networks under three quantum data access regimes. Without any assumptions, we establish a quadratic speedup over classical methods for shallow bilinear-style networks. With efficient quantum access to the weights, we obtain a quartic speedup over classical methods. With efficient quantum access to both the inputs and the network weights, we prove that a network with an $N$-dimensional vectorized input, $k$ residual block layers, and a final residual-linear-pooling layer can be implemented with an error of $\epsilon$ with $O(\text{polylog}(N/\epsilon)^k)$ inference cost.</p>

            <p>Over two decades ago, Bruce Kane proposed that spin-half phosphorus nuclei embedded in a spin-zero silicon substrate could serve as a viable platform for spin-based quantum computing. These nuclear spins exhibit remarkably long coherence times, making them ideal candidates for qubits. Despite this advantage, practical realisation of spin quantum computing remains a challenge. More recently, physicist Matthew Fisher proposed a hypothesis linking nuclear spin dynamics, specifically those of phosphorus nuclei within the spin-zero matrix of calcium phosphate molecules, to neural activation and, potentially, cognition. The theory has generated both interest and scepticism, with some fundamental questions remaining. We review this intersection of quantum computing and quantum biology by outlining the similarities between these models of quantum computing and quantum cognition. We then address some of the open questions and the lessons that might be learned in each context. In doing so, we highlight a promising bidirectional exchange: not only might quantum computing offer tools for understanding quantum biology, but biological models may also inspire novel strategies for quantum information processing.</p>

Applications of our algorithm include validating quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications, where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.</p>

More precisely, the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate can be implemented to within error $\epsilon$ in the diamond distance by a randomly chosen Clifford+$T$ circuit with at most $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ $T$ gates. We also give a matching $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$ lower bound that establishes optimality, and we show that any purely unitary implementation achieving even constant error must use $\Omega(n)$ $T$ gates. We also extend our sampling technique to implement other Boolean functions. Finally, we describe upper and lower bounds on the $T$-count of Boolean functions in terms of non-adaptive parity decision tree complexity and its randomized analogue.</p>

            <p>Efficient learning of quantum state properties is both a fundamental and practical problem in quantum information theory. Classical shadows have emerged as an efficient method for estimating properties of unknown quantum states, with rigorous statistical guarantees, by performing randomized measurement on a few number of copies. With the advent of photonic technologies, formulating efficient learning algorithms for such platforms comes out as a natural problem. Here, we introduce a classical shadow protocol for learning photonic quantum states via randomized passive linear optical transformations and photon-number measurement. We show that this scheme is efficient for a large class of observables of interest. We experimentally demonstrate our findings on a twelve-mode photonic integrated quantum processing unit. Our protocol allows for scalable learning of a wide range of photonic state properties and paves the way to applying the already rich variety of applications of classical shadows to photonic platforms.</p>

            <p>In the present article, we examine the relationship of negative conditional quantum Kaniadakis entropy ($\alpha-$CQKE) with the fully entangled fraction (FEF) which is a substantial yardstick for quantum information processing protocols including teleportation, and quantum steerability, executed over four vital quantum states with maximally mixed marginals, the 2-qubit Werner state, the 2-qubit Weyl state, the 2-qudit Werner state and the isotropic state. We initiate our analysis in 2$\otimes$2 systems where we derive implicit bounds on FEF when the $\alpha-$CQKE takes negative values, i.e. when $\alpha-$CQKE $\in$ $R^{-}$ for 2-qubit Werner state. Consequently, we derive the sufficient implicit bounds for a definitive claim on the non-usefulness of Werner state for quantum teleportation provided its visibility parameter succeeds to elude a critical region, the exception region 1, where the situation becomes inconclusive. Subsequently, we replicate the same for the 2-qubit Weyl state with some constraints augmented by an analogous exception region 2 and the correlation tensor matrix elements. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to d $\otimes$ d states, commencing our analysis with the Isotropic state. We derive implicit bounds on FEF of the Isotropic state and the 2-qudit Werner state resembling the ones in the 2$\otimes$2 analysis. Additionally, we utilize the convoluted relationship between the FEF and quantum steerability to formulate propositions linking negative $\alpha-$CQKE to the k-copy steerability of isotropic states for projective measurements, thereby reducing the intricacy of the study of k-copy steerability directly via FEF. In the appendix section of the article, we provide corroborative calculations and supplementary materials to the theorems presented in the main sections.</p>

            <p>We establish novel connections between magic in quantum circuits and communication complexity. In particular, we show that functions computable with low magic have low communication cost. Our first result shows that the $\mathsf{D}\|$ (deterministic simultaneous message passing) cost of a Boolean function $f$ is at most the number of single-qubit magic gates in a quantum circuit computing $f$ with any quantum advice state. If we allow mid-circuit measurements and adaptive circuits, we obtain an upper bound on the two-way communication complexity of $f$ in terms of the magic + measurement cost of the circuit for $f$. As an application, we obtain magic-count lower bounds of $\Omega(n)$ for the $n$-qubit generalized Toffoli gate as well as the $n$-qubit quantum multiplexer. Our second result gives a general method to transform $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous quantum messages with shared entanglement) into $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous classical messages with shared entanglement) which incurs only a polynomial blowup in the communication and entanglement complexity, provided the referee's action in the $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocol is implementable in constant $T$-depth. The resulting $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols satisfy strong privacy constraints and are $\mathsf{PSM}^*$ protocols (private simultaneous message passing with shared entanglement), where the referee learns almost nothing about the inputs other than the function value. As an application, we demonstrate $n$-bit partial Boolean functions whose $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ complexity is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and whose $\mathsf{R}$ (interactive randomized) complexity is $n^{\Omega(1)}$, establishing the first exponential separations between $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ and $\mathsf{R}$ for Boolean functions.</p>

By exploring the interplay of noise and quantum resources, we identify several computational phase transitions, revealing regimes where even modest noise levels render bosonic circuits efficiently classically simulable. In particular, our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: computational resources usually associated with bosonic quantum advantage, namely non-Gaussianity and symplectic coherence, can make the system easier to classically simulate in presence of noise.</p>

            <p>Despite extensive study, our understanding of quantum Markov chains remains far less complete than that of their classical counterparts. [Temme'13] observed that the Davies Lindbladian, a well-studied model of quantum Markov dynamics, contains an embedded classical Markov generator, raising the natural question of how the convergence properties of the quantum and classical dynamics are related. While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the Davies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical generator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then the two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain techniques to the quantum setting. The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded in terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient. Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full Davies generator.</p>

            <p>We introduce transversal dimension jump, a code-switching protocol for lifted product (LP) quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes across different chain-complex dimensions, enabling universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with low overhead. The construction leverages the product structure of LP codes to implement one-way transversal CNOTs between a 3D code and its 2D component codes, enabling teleportation-based switching. Combined with constant-depth CCZ gates in 3D LP codes and low-overhead transversal Clifford gates in 2D LP codes, this yields universal, high-rate quantum logical computation with high thresholds and low space-time costs. Beyond asymptotic schemes, we identify explicit 3D-2D LP code pairs supporting cup-product CCZ gates, including bivariate tricycle-bicycle families such as the $[[81,3,5]]$-$[[54,2,6]]$ pair, where the 3D tricycle codes admit depth-2 CCZ, weight-6 stabilizers, and pseudo-thresholds $\gtrsim 0.4\%$. As a byproduct, we show that the 3D codes enable highly efficient magic-state preparation: a single round of stabilizer measurements followed by depth-2 CCZ and postselection produces states with error $<10^{-9}$ and success probability $\sim 35\%$. Our results establish a native integration of qLDPC codes with complementary transversal gates-covering nearly all practically relevant families known so far-and open a broad design space for scalable, low-overhead universal quantum computation.</p>

We build upon prior works by Hastings~(\textit{Quantum}, 2020) and Schmidhuber~\textit{et al.}~(\textit{Phys.~Rev.~X.}, 2025), we address key limitations by introducing a native qubit-based encoding for the Kikuchi method, enabling explicit quantum circuit constructions and non-asymptotic resource estimation. Our approach substantially reduces constant overheads through a novel guiding state preparation technique as well as circuit optimizations, reducing the threshold for a quantum advantage. We further extend the algorithmic framework to support recovery in sparse tensor PCA and tensor completion, and generalize detection to asymmetric tensors, demonstrating that the quantum advantage persists in these broader settings. Detailed resource estimates show that 900 logical qubits, $\sim 10^{15}$ gates and $\sim 10^{12}$ gate depth suffice for a problem that classically requires $\sim 10^{23}$ FLOPs. The gate count and depth for the same problem without the improvements presented in this paper would be at least $10^{19}$ and $10^{18}$ respectively. These advances position tensor problems as a candidate for quantum advantage whose resource requirements benefit significantly from algorithmic and compilation improvements; the magnitude of the improvements suggest that further enhancements are possible, which would make the algorithm viable for upcoming fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</p>

We present a universal approach that efficiently maps any polynomial-size superposition of occupation-number configurations to the first-quantized representation on a digital quantum computer.

Operationally, we prepare an encoded superposition of Schur labels via a block-encoded linear combination of unitaries and then apply the inverse quantum Schur transform. The algorithm runs in time $\text{poly}(L, N, d, \log \epsilon^{-1})$ for $L$ configurations of $N$ particles over $d$ modes to accuracy $\epsilon$, and applies universally to fermions, bosons, and Green's paraparticles in arbitrary single-particle bases.

            <h2>End-to-End Quantum Algorithm for Topology Optimization in Structural Mechanics</h2>

            <p>Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space, evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work, we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Replica Exchange</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zherui Chen, Joao Basso, Zhiyan Ding, Lin Lin</p>
            <p>The presence of energy barriers in the state space of a physical system can lead to exponentially slow convergence for sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the classical setting, replica exchange (or parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a similar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time of quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue of the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of two replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of Hamiltonians with local energy barriers. Our main result provides a rigorous lower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which leads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier height. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples, including the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and defected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature. Our work provides a rigorous acceleration mechanism for quantum Gibbs preparation.</p>

            <h2>Fine-Grained Unambiguous Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quentin Buzet, André Chailloux</p>
            <p>Unambiguous measurements play an important role in quantum information, with applications ranging from quantum key distribution to quantum state reconstruction. Recently, such measurements have also been used in quantum algorithms based on Regev's reduction. The key problem for these algorithms is the S-LWE problem for lattice problems, or the Quantum Decoding Problem for code problems. A key idea for addressing this problem is to use unambiguous measurements to recover $k$ coordinates of a code (or lattice) element $x$ from a quantum state $|\psi_x\rangle$, which corresponds to a noisy word $x$ with errors in quantum superposition. However, a general theoretical framework to analyze this approach has been lacking. In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous measurements. Given a family of states $\{\,|\psi_x\rangle\,\}_{x\in\{0,1\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist measurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about $x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally arises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal number of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear program, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results showing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach of arXiv:2310.20651. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the Quantum Decoding Problem.</p>

            <p>Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of continuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical systems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a fundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we efficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the perspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory, characterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of the number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of copies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then extend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies suffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are far. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states necessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a fundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on rotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently introduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds.</p>

            <h2>Modeling amortization systems with vector spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Sebastian Ardenghi</p>
            <p>Amortization systems are used widely in economy to generate payment schedules to repaid an initial debt with its interest. We present a generalization of these amortization systems by introducing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics based on vector spaces. Operators are defined for debt, amortization, interest and periodic payment and their mean values are computed in different orthonormal basis. The vector space of the amortization system will have dimension M, where M is the loan maturity and the vectors will have a SO(M) symmetry, yielding the possibility of rotating the basis of the vector space while preserving the distance among vectors. The results obtained are useful to add degrees of freedom to the usual amortization systems without affecting the interest profits of the lender while also benefitting the borrower who is able to alter the payment schedules. Furthermore, using the tensor product of algebras, we introduce loans entanglement in which two borrowers can correlate the payment schedules without altering the total repaid.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Pricing Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Xin</p>
            <p>Motivated by Heisenberg's observable-only stance, we replace latent "information" (filtrations, hidden diffusions, state variables) with observable transitions between price states. On a discrete price lattice with a Hilbert-space representation, shift operators and the spectral calculus of the price define observable frequency operators and a translation-invariant convolution generator. Combined with jump operators that encode transition intensities, this yields a completely positive, translation-covariant Lindblad semigroup. Under the risk-neutral condition the framework leads to a nonlocal pricing equation that is diagonal in Fourier space; in the small-mesh diffusive limit its generator converges to the classical Black-Scholes-Merton operator. We do not propose another parametric model. We propose a foundation for model construction that is observable, first-principles, and mathematically natural. Noncommutativity emerges from the observable shift algebra rather than being postulated. The jump-intensity ledger determines tail behavior and short-maturity smiles and implies testable links between extreme-event probabilities and implied-volatility wings. Future directions: (i) multi-asset systems on higher-dimensional lattices with vector shifts and block kernels; (ii) state- or flow-dependent kernels as "financial interactions" leading to nonlinear master equations while preserving linear risk-neutral pricing; (iii) empirical tests of the predicted scaling relations between jump intensities and market extremes.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengjie Yang, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>A doubly composite Chernoff-Stein lemma and its applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>Given a sequence of random variables $X^n=X_1,\ldots, X_n$, discriminating between two hypotheses on the underlying probability distribution is a key task in statistics and information theory. Of interest here is the Stein exponent, i.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a vanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and i.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative entropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of this result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings where the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but rather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components taken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that applies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely correlated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both hypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either hypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved using a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2025]. In this refined form, blurring is applied symbol by symbol, which makes it both stronger and applicable also in the absence of permutational symmetry. The second part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter formula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad families of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying alternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction' statement that covers a wide family of convex constraints. Applications to quantum hypothesis testing are explored in a related paper [Lami, arXiv:today].</p>

            <h2>Emergent Mixed States for Baby Universes and Black Holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonah Kudler-Flam, Edward Witten</p>
            <p>We examine the behavior of sequences of states in the large $N$ limit of AdS/CFT duality in cases in which the bulk duals involve baby universes or black holes. Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby universe.</p>

            <h2>Twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, anomaly index, and generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems with anti-unitary symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruizhi Liu, Jinmin Yi, Liujun Zou</p>
            <p>Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices, which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state, as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions, the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general theorems in various concrete examples.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.</p>

            <h2>Noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward McCann</p>
            <p>By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.</p>

            <h2>Towards Nonperturbative Solution of Quantum Dynamics : A Hamiltonian Mean Field Approximation Scheme with Perturbation Theory for Arbitray Strength of Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. P. Mahapatra</p>
            <p>We introduce a non perturbative general approximation scheme (NGAS) that can handle interactions of any strength in quantum theory. This approach starts with an input Hamiltonian that can be solved exactly. The interaction effects are then built into this Hamiltonian through nonlinear feedback enforced by self consistency conditions. While the method itself is nonperturbative it can be systematically improved using a new perturbation method called 'mean field perturbation theory' which does not involve power series expansion in any small parameter. We put this scheme to the test on one dimensional anharmonic interactions using the harmonic approximation. The results are consistently accurate across various cases including quartic, sextic, and octic anharmonic oscillators, as well as the quartic double well oscillator (QDWO) even when the coupling strength varies widely. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated when we swap the input Hamiltonian for that of an infinite square well and still achieve comparable accuracy. When applied to the {\lambda}{\phi}4 quantum field theory this approach aligns with the Gaussian effective potential method under the harmonic approximation. Beyond that it reveals the condensate structure of the effective vacuum and highlights the instability of the perturbative ground state. Notably, our ground-state energy results for the QDWO stand in stark contrast to those from standard perturbation theory where Borel summation fails regardless of coupling strength.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahana Chakraborty, Michele Pini, Martina S. Zündel, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device.

            <p>This work investigates the family of extended tilted-CHSH inequalities in the single-prover cryptographic compiled setting. In particular, we show that a quantum polynomial-time prover can violate these Bell inequalities by at most negligibly more than the violation achieved by two non-communicating quantum provers. To obtain this result, we extend a sum-of-squares technique to monomials with arbitrarily high degree in the Bob operators and degree at most one in the Alice operators. We also introduce a notion of partial self-testing for the compiled setting, which resembles a weaker form of self-testing in the bipartite setting. As opposed to certifying the full model, partial self-testing attempts to certify the reduced states and measurements on separate subsystems. In the compiled setting, this is akin to the states after the first round of interaction and measurements made on that state. Lastly, we show that the extended tilted-CHSH inequalities satisfy this notion of a compiled self-test.</p>

            <p>The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</p>

            <p>Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.</p>

We establish this link by considering a coherent input encoding in conjunction with tunable qubit decay, giving precise control over the fading memory in the quantum reservoir computer.

Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group.

            <p>We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasiconserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing crossover to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the crossover.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Monitoring of Multimode Squeezing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Kalash, Aditya Sudharsanam, M. H. M. Passos, Valentina Parigi, Maria Chekhova</p>
            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enhancing metrological sensitivity, boosting communication security, and enabling parallel processing in computation. Its practical potential, however, remains constrained by the inherent single-mode operation of homodyne detection, necessitating post-processing for multimode characterization. Here, we overcome this long-standing challenge by employing multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA), enabling loss-tolerant direct detection of squeezing in each mode, which in turn permits mode sorting after amplification. As a result, we demonstrate, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the real-time monitoring of multimode squeezing. With a spatial light modulator sorting the modes, we simultaneously measure squeezing in nine spatial modes co-propagating within one beam. Although mode sorting and filtering reduce the detection efficiency to less than $0.3\%$, we observe high-purity squeezing of up to $-7.9 \pm 0.6$ dB -- to the best of our knowledge, the highest squeezing recorded for pulsed light. Furthermore, we demonstrate real-time, loss-tolerant characterization of continuous-variable entanglement and extend it to the detection of cluster states. Similar methods can be applied in the frequency domain, facilitating a crucial capability for scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Finite Size and Large Depth and Equivalence to Quantum Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sami Boulebnane, James Sud, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing are two of the most popular quantum optimization heuristics. While QAOA is known to be able to approximate quantum annealing, the approximation requires QAOA angles to vanish with the problem size $n$, whereas optimized QAOA angles are observed to be size-independent for small $n$ and constant in the infinite-size limit. This fact led to a folklore belief that QAOA has a mechanism that is fundamentally different from quantum annealing. In this work, we provide evidence against this by analytically showing that QAOA energy approximates that of quantum annealing under two conditions, namely that angles vary smoothly from one layer to the next and that the sum is bounded by a constant. These conditions are known to hold for near-optimal QAOA angles empirically. Our proof relies on a series expansion of QAOA energy in sum of angles, which we show converges to quantum annealing limit as QAOA depth grows for constant sum of angles even if angles do not vanish with problem size $n$. A corollary of our results is a quadratic improvement for the bound on depth required to compile Trotterized quantum annealing of the SK model in the average case.</p>

            <h2>From Quantum-Mechanical Acceleration Limits to Upper Bounds on Fluctuation Growth of Observables in Unitary Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Cafaro, Walid Redjem, Paul M. Alsing, Newshaw Bahreyni, Christian Corda</p>
            <p>Quantum Speed Limits (QSLs) are fundamentally linked to the tenets of quantum mechanics, particularly the energy-time uncertainty principle. Notably, the Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) bound and the Margolus-Levitin (ML) bound are prominent examples of QSLs. Recently, the notion of a quantum acceleration limit has been proposed for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems governed by arbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. This limit articulates that the rate of change over time of the standard deviation of the Hamiltonian operator-representing the acceleration of quantum evolution within projective Hilbert space-is constrained by the standard deviation of the time-derivative of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we extend our earlier findings to encompass any observable A within the framework of unitary quantum dynamics. This relationship signifies that the speed of the standard deviation of any observable is limited by the standard deviation of its associated velocity-like observable. Finally, for pedagogical purposes, we illustrate the relevance of our inequality by providing clear examples. We choose suitable observables related to the unitary dynamics of two-level quantum systems, as well as a harmonic oscillator within a finite-dimensional Fock space.</p>

            <p>We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</p>

            <h2>Isoprobability Models of Qubit Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov</p>
            <p>Efficient quantum control is a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum technologies, from computation to sensing and communications. Several approaches in quantum control, e.g. optimal control and inverse engineering, use pulse amplitude and frequency shaping as control tools. Often, these approaches prescribe pulse shapes which are difficult or impossible to implement. To this end, we develop the concept of isoprobability classes of models of qubit dynamics, in which various pairs of time-dependent pulse amplitude and frequency generate the same transition probability profile (albeit different temporal evolutions toward this probability). In this manner, we introduce an additional degree of freedom, and hence flexibility in qubit control. Selection of hardware-aware temporal pulse shapes has the potential to decrease gate duration, overcome platform constraints and increase robustness to noise. We demonstrate this approach with two classes of isoprobability models, which derive from the established Landau-Majorana-Stückelberg-Zener (LMSZ) and Allen-Eberly-Hioe (AEH) classes. We experimentally validate the isoprobability equivalence on an IBM Quantum processor, quantifying agreement with numerical simulations via the mean squared error (MSE). Instead of frequency (i.e. detuning) shaping, which is difficult to implement on this platform, we exploit the time-dependent phase of the driving field to induce an effective detuning. Indeed, the temporal derivative of the phase function emulates a variable detuning, thereby avoiding the need for direct detuning control. The experimental validation of the isoprobability concept with the time-dependent phase control underscores the potential of this robust and accessible method for high-fidelity quantum operations, bringing us one step closer to scalable quantum control in various quantum applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Heightman, Edward Jiang, Ruth Mora-Soto, Maciej Lewenstein, Marcin Płodzień</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present an experimental deployment of a new design for combined quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Novel to our system is the dynamic obfuscation of the QKD-PQC sequence of operations, the number of operations, and parameters related to the operations; coupled to the integration of a GPS-free quantum synchronization protocol within the QKD process. We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption, demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.</p>

            <p>A quantum memory for light is expected to play a crucial role in quantum communication protocols and distributed quantum computing. In addition to storage and buffering, a quantum memory can be used for manipulations of stored states to allow more complex quantum network operations. In this work, we demonstrate an in-memory Fourier transform using a combination of two well-established quantum memory protocols: Gradient Echo Memory and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser cooled in an elongated magneto-optic trap to maximise optical depth. The results of our time-frequency Fourier transform can be understood as a temporal double slit. We show that the interference between time-separated pulses depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring similar capability to quantum optical systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal Precision Limits in General Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tan Van Vu, Ryotaro Honma, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems that interact with their environments at arbitrary coupling strengths and are subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained not only by entropy production but also by this asymmetry. For general observables, we further prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term that characterizes environmental changes. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental limits of precision in a broad class of open quantum systems, beyond the traditional Markovian setting.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We study the emergence of local reminiscence in the PXP model, a constrained spin system realized in Rydberg atom arrays. The spectrum of this model is characterized by a majority of eigenstates that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, alongside a set of nonthermal eigenstates, known as quantum many-body scars, that violate it. While generic initial states lead to thermalization consistent with eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, special configurations generate non-ergodic dynamics and preserve memory of the initial state. In this work, we explore local memory retention using local fidelity and the dynamics of local observables. We find that two specific states, $\theta$-symmetric and blockaded states, exhibit robust local reminiscence, with fidelities near unity and suppressed fluctuations as the system size increases. Our results show that non-ergodic regimes can sustain stable local memory while still allowing for complex global dynamics, providing new insights into quantum many-body scars and constrained dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jucelino Ferreira de Sousa, Diego Paiva Pires</p>
            <p>We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing general physical processes. These QSLs were obtained using two families of entropic measures, namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which in turn defines a faithful distance of quantum states, and the square root of the quantum Jeffreys divergence. The results apply to both closed and open quantum systems, and are evaluated in terms of the Schatten speed of the evolved state, as well as cost functions that depend on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of both initial and instantaneous states of the quantum system. To illustrate our findings, we focus on the unitary and nonunitary dynamics of mixed single-qubit states. In the first case, we obtain speed limits $\textit{à la}$ Mandelstam-Tamm that are inversely proportional to the variance of the Hamiltonian driving the evolution. In the second case, we set the nonunitary dynamics to be described by the noisy operations: depolarizing channel, phase damping channel, and generalized amplitude damping channel. We provide analytical results for the two entropic measures, present numerical simulations to support our results on the speed limits, comment on the tightness of the bounds, and provide a comparison with previous QSLs. Our results may find applications in the study of quantum thermodynamics, entropic uncertainty relations, and also complexity of many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Running quantum circuits on quantum computers does not always generate "clean" results, unlike on a simulator, as noise plays a significant role in any quantum device. To explore this, we experimented with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on quantum simulators and real quantum hardware. QAOA is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and requires hundreds or thousands of independent executions of the quantum circuit for optimization, which typically goes beyond the publicly available resources for quantum computing. We were granted access to the IBM Quantum System One at the Cleveland Clinic, the first on-premises IBM system in the U.S. This paper explores different optimization methods, techniques, and error mitigation methods to observe how they react to quantum noise differently, which is helpful for other researchers to understand the complexities of running QAOA on real quantum hardware and the challenges faced in dealing with noise.</p>

            <p>Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.</p>

PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification.

This aligns with the alternative quantum unique games conjecture on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label cover problem proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25). Our techniques employ a series of reductions from the halting problem to the quantum smooth label cover problem, and include a quantum-sound version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5 (STOC'96), which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Quantum annealing provides a practical realization of adiabatic quantum computation and has emerged as a promising approach for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, current devices remain constrained by sparse hardware connectivity, which requires embedding logical variables into chains of physical qubits. This embedding overhead limits scalability and reduces reliability as longer chains are more prone to noise-induced errors. In this work, building on the known structural result that the average chain length in clique embeddings grows linearly with the problem size, we develop a mathematical framework that connects embedding-induced overhead with hardware noise in D-Wave's Zephyr topology. Our analysis derives closed-form expressions for chain break probability and chain break fraction under a Gaussian control error model, establishing how noise scales with embedding size and how chain strength should be adjusted with chain length to maintain reliability. Experimental results from the Zephyr topology-based quantum processing unit confirm the accuracy of these predictions, demonstrating both the validity of the theoretical noise model and the practical relevance of the derived scaling rule. Beyond validating a theoretical model against hardware data, our findings establish a general embedding-aware noise framework that explains the trade-off between chain stability and logical coupler fidelity. Our framework advances the understanding of noise amplification in current devices and provides quantitative guidance for embedding-aware parameter tuning strategies.</p>

            <p>Post-selection strategies that discard low-confidence computational results can significantly improve the effective fidelity of quantum error correction at the cost of reduced acceptance rates, which can be particularly useful for offline resource state generation. Prior work has primarily relied on the "logical gap" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%). Additionally, we integrate our approach with the sliding-window framework for real-time decoding, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions that eliminate unnecessary overheads. Notably, its performance matches or even surpasses the original strategy for global decoding, while exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds. Our approach provides a practical foundation for efficient post-selection in fault-tolerant quantum computing with QLDPC codes.</p>

            <p>In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout, requiring only two bound spins for its implementation. In conjunction with charge sensing techniques, SB has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect selectively different spin measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin-selective readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1 - 8 $\mu$s. Our method should help perform projective spin measurements with high spin-to-charge conversion fidelity in systems subject to strong SOC, will facilitate state leakage detection and enable complete readout of two-spin states.</p>

We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Attila Szabó</p>
            <p>Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Miao, Linhao Li, Hosho Katsura, Masahito Yamazaki</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Norihiro Iizuka, Akihiro Miyata, Mitsuhiro Nishida</p>
            <p>The Markov gap, defined as the difference between reflected entropy and mutual information, serves as a diagnostic for quantum recoverability and multipartite entanglement. In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</p>

            <h2>A Calibration-Free Fixed Point of Curved Boolean Logic Matching the Fine-Structure Constant</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian R. P. von Liechtenstein</p>
            <p>We show that Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) admits a calibration-free fixed point at which the per-face holonomy theta_0 is the same across independent minimal faces (CHSH, KCBS, SAT_6). Equality is enforced by solving the two-component system F(delta, gamma_4, gamma_5, gamma_6) = (theta_0^(4) - theta_0^(5), theta_0^(5) - theta_0^(6)) = 0 with a Gauss-Newton method (no external scale). A finite-difference Jacobian is full rank at the solution, implying local uniqueness. Working at the coupling level g = |theta_0|/(2*pi*n) removes hidden length factors; at the equality point our normalization audit shows g = alpha (Thomson limit) within numerical tolerance. The SU(1,1) corner words and overlap placements used to compute theta_0 are specified exactly; we also report a variational minimax analysis on g and a pilot non-backtracking spectral density that coincides numerically with the per-edge coupling, suggesting a purely topological formulation. Scope: the match is to the low-energy (Thomson) limit; a full spectral equality on the contextual complex is left as a short conjecture. These results promote the CBL--alpha connection from a calibrated identification to a calibration-free derivation candidate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Sandfuchs, Carla Ferradini, Renato Renner</p>
            <p>We consider a pair of causally independent processes, modelled as the tensor product of two channels, acting on a possibly correlated input to produce random outputs X and Y. We show that, assuming the processes produce a sufficient amount of randomness, one can extract uniform randomness from X and Y. This generalizes prior results, which assumed that X and Y are (conditionally) independent. Note that in contrast to the independence of quantum states, the independence of channels can be enforced through spacelike separation. As a consequence, our results allow for the generation of randomness under more practical and physically justifiable assumptions than previously possible. We illustrate this with the example of device-independent randomness amplification, where we can remove the constraint that the adversary only has access to classical side information about the source.</p>

            <p>Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</p>

            <p>A key issue of current quantum advantage experiments is that their verification requires a full classical simulation of the ideal computation. This limits the regime in which the experiments can be verified to precisely the regime in which they are also simulatable. An important outstanding question is therefore to find quantum advantage schemes that are also classically verifiable. We make progress on this question by designing a new quantum advantage proposal--Hidden Code Sampling--whose output distribution is conditionally peaked. These peaks enable verification in far less time than it takes for full simulation. At the same time, we show that exactly sampling from the output distribution is classically hard unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, and we propose a plausible conjecture regarding average-case hardness. Our scheme is based on ideas from quantum error correction. The required quantum computations are closely related to quantum fault-tolerant circuits and can potentially be implemented transversally. Our proposal may thus give rise to a next generation of quantum advantage experiments en route to full quantum fault tolerance.</p>

Additionally these beams allow trapping of larger particles outside the Rayleigh regime using both bright and dark tweezer trapping with reduced recoil heating. By changing the wavelength of the trapping laser, or the size of the particles, non-linear and repulsive potentials of interest for the creation of non-classical states of motion can also be created.</p>

            <p>The generation of entangled photons through Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a critical resource for many key experiments and technologies in the domain of quantum optics. Historically, SPDC was limited to the generation of photon pairs. However, the use of the strong nonlinearities in circuit quantum electrodynamics has recently enabled the observation of Three-Photon SPDC (3P-SPDC). Despite great interest in the entanglement structure of the resultant states, entanglement between photon triplets produced by a 3P-SPDC source has still has not been confirmed. Here, we report on the observation of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in the steady-state output field of a 3P-SPDC source consisting of a superconducting parametric cavity coupled to a transmission line. We study this non-Gaussian tripartite entanglement using an entanglement witness built from three-mode correlation functions, and observe a maximum violation of the bound by 23 standard deviations of the statistical noise. Furthermore, we find strong agreement between the observed and the analytically predicted scaling of the entanglement witness. We then explore the impact of the temporal function used to define the photon mode on the observed value of the entanglement witness.</p>

These radicals, generated through photoreduction, are optically identifiable and stable on timescales exceeding an hour. We experimentally demonstrate their coherent manipulation and detection using single, shallow NV centers for readout. We observe heterogeneity in the local magnetic environments of the photoactivated spins from site to site, likely due to variations in inter-radical couplings across our measurements. Looking forward, our approach enables correlative nanoscale magnetic and optical imaging, and opens new pathways toward single-molecule magnetic resonance studies.</p>

            <p>Magnetic response measurements in the presence of AC drive fields provide critical insight into the properties of magnetic and conductive materials, such as phase transitions in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets, the heating efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles in biological environments, and the integrity of metals in eddy current testing. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a commonly-used platform for such studies, due to their high spatial resolution and sensitivity, but are typically limited to weak-drive conditions, i.e., AC drive fields well below the NV microwave (MW) pulse Rabi strength. Once the AC drive field grows comparable to or larger than the Rabi strength, the induced MW pulse detuning suppresses NV sensitivity to the out-of-phase magnetic response, which encodes dissipation and conductivity in materials of interest. Here, we introduce a phase modulation protocol that cancels MW pulse detuning to leading order, and extends NV AC magnetometry into the strong drive field regime. The protocol, termed SIPHT (Signal Isolation through PHase Tuning), is experimentally demonstrated using an NV ensemble. By directly comparing SIPHT to the conventional Hahn echo AC sensing protocol, we quantify the preservation of NV magnetometry contrast for an out-of-phase signal. We further showcase SIPHT by detecting eddy current-induced magnetic fields from Cu, Al, and Ti samples, with the measured response field phase delays reflecting their distinct conductivities. SIPHT extends NV AC magnetometry to regimes inaccessible to standard dynamical decoupling measurement protocols, unlocking novel utility, e.g., in the study of magnetic hyperthermia and nondestructive testing of conductors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Regression Theory and Efficient Computation of Response Functions for Non-Markovian Open Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiantao Li, Chunhao Wang</p>
            <p>Linear response functions are a cornerstone concept in physics as they enable efficient estimation of many dynamical properties. In addition to predicting dynamics of observables under perturbations without resimulating the system, these response functions lead to electric conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, dielectric constants, etc. Estimating two-time correlation functions is a key ingredient of measuring linear response functions. However, for open quantum systems, simulating the reduced density operator with a quantum master equation only yields \emph{one-point} observables and is insufficient for this task. In this paper, we develop a memoryless, system-only formulation of two-point correlations for open quantum systems that extends the standard quantum regression theorem (QRT) beyond the Markov limit. We further incorporate the spectral property of the bath and express the time propagators in the response function as the memoryless generators in Lindblad-type forms. The resulting expressions recast the total response function into evolutions generated by time-dependent Hamiltonian and Lindblad primitives together with the more challenging propagation of commutators and anti-commutators. In addition to the derivation of the new QRT, we present quantum algorithms for these primitives and obtain an estimator for two-time correlations whose cost scales poly-logarithmically in the system dimension and $1/\epsilon^{1.25}$ in the target accuracy $\epsilon$. The framework removes the separability (Born-Markov) assumption and offers a pathway to efficient computation of nonequilibrium properties from open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The dark-state effect, caused by destructive quantum interference, is an important physical effect in atomic physics and quantum optics. It not only deepens the understanding of light-atom interactions, but also has wide application in quantum physics and quantum information. Therefore, how to efficiently and conveniently determine the number and form of the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with complex transitions is an important and interesting topic in this field. In this work, we present a general theory for determining the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with any coupling configuration using the arrowhead-matrix method. To confirm the dark states in a multilevel system, we first define the upper- and lower-state subspaces, and then diagonalize the Hamiltonians restricted within the two subspaces to obtain the dressed upper and lower states. By further expressing the transitions between the dressed upper and lower states, we can map the multilevel system to a bipartite-graph network, in which the nodes and links are acted by the dressed states and transitions, respectively. Based on the coupling configurations of the network, we can determine the lower dark states with respect to the upper-state subspace. As examples, we analyze the dark states in three-, four-, and five-level quantum systems, for all possible configurations through the classification of the numbers of upper and lower states. Further, we extend the framework to multilevel quantum systems and discuss the existence of dark states in some typical configurations. We also recover the results of the dark-state polaritons in driven three-level systems with the arrowhead-matrix method. Our theory paves the way for manipulating and utilizing the dark states of multilevel quantum systems in modern quantum science and technology.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum systems play a crucial role in advancing scalable and versatile quantum networks as they combine the strengths of different quantum platforms. An important challenge for the development of hybrid quantum networks lies in interfacing heterogeneous quantum nodes and distributing entanglement among them. Single photons emitted from these dissimilar quantum nodes typically show distinct spectral and temporal properties. Therefore, they necessitate spectral filtering and temporal synchronization, which introduce significant photon losses and require additional resources. In this work, we successfully generate indistinguishable photons from two distinct quantum systems of a warm atomic ensemble and a solid-state quantum dot. Remarkably, quantum interference between dissimilar sources is achieved without additional spectral filtering and time synchronization, which enables autonomous quantum nodes for a hybrid quantum network. 133Cs atomic ensemble can efficiently generate heralded single photons at the wavelength of 917 nm of the 6P_(3/2)-6D_(5/2) transition, while the single photons emitted from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot can be tuned to match the 133Cs transition wavelength. Our dense warm atomic ensemble and cavity-coupled quantum dot can efficiently generate bright and resonant single photons at detection rates approaching MHz, respectively. More importantly, these single photons exhibit inherent spectral similarities not only in the wavelength but also in the spectral linewidth, achieving a high spectral overlap of 0.92. Such intrinsic compatibility between dissimilar quantum sources is essential to leverage the advantages of different quantum platforms, paving the way toward a large-scale and functional hybrid quantum network.</p>

First, we examine the validity of the rotating wave approximation imposed previously on the qubit-reservoir coupling with respect to the disentanglement dynamics. Second, generation of the entanglement as well as destruction are analyzed by monitoring the reduced dynamics during and after application of a $\sqrt{\mbox{iSWAP}^\dagger}$ gate, also focusing on memory effects caused by reservoirs. Finally, the performance of a Hadamard + CNOT sequence is analyzed for different gate decomposition schemes.

The hierarchy includes global nonclassicality, entanglement, asymmetric quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality. We elucidate the interplay between the system physical nonlinearity -- which serves as a source of quantumness -- and the specific dynamics of bosonic PTSSs, which are qualitatively influenced by their damping and amplification characteristics. Using a set of quantifiers -- including local and global nonclassicality depths, negativity, steering parameters, and the Bell parameter -- we demonstrate that the standard PTSS typically exhibits weaker quantumness than its counterparts affected solely by damping or solely by amplification. Both the maximum values attained by these quantifiers and the speed and duration of their generation are generally lower in the standard PTSS. A comparative analysis of three two-mode PTSSs -- standard, passive, and active -- with identical eigenvectors and real parts of eigenfrequencies, but differing in their damping and amplification strengths, reveals the crucial role of quantum fluctuations associated with gain and loss. Among them, the passive PTSS yields the most strongly nonclassical states. Nevertheless, under suitable conditions, the standard PTSS can also generate highly nonclassical states. The supremacy of the passive PTSS is further supported by its fundamental advantages in practical realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongkun Chen, Daohong Xu, Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, Jeff D. Thompson, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</p>

            <h2>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-Huang Chen</p>
            <p>We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations.</p>

            <p>We explore the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of superconducting aluminum thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates at cryogenic temperatures of 6 K and compare their behavior with films synthesized at room temperature. We demonstrate that cryogenic growth increases structural disorder, producing crystalline grains that modify the optical, electrical, and superconducting properties of aluminum. We observe that cryogenic deposition changes the color of aluminum from fully reflective to yellow and correlate the pseudo-dielectric function and reflectance with structural changes in the film. We find that smaller grain sizes enhance the superconductivity of aluminum, increasing its critical temperature and critical field. We then estimate the superconducting gap and coherence length of Cooper pairs in aluminum in the presence of disorder. Finally, we fabricate superconducting microwave resonators on these films and find that, independently of the growth temperature, the system is dominated by two-level system loss with similar quality factors in the high and low power regimes. We further measure a higher kinetic inductance in the cryogenically grown films.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Magic State Cultivation on the Surface Code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yotam Vaknin, Shoham Jacoby, Arne Grimsmo, Alex Retzker</p>
            <p>Magic state cultivation is a newly proposed protocol that represents the state of the art in magic state generation. It uses the transversality of the $H_{XY}$ gate on the 2D triangular color-code, together with a novel grafting mechanism to transform the color-code into a matchable code with minimal overhead. Still, the resulting code has a longer cycle time and some high weight stabilizers. Here, we introduce three new cultivation protocols, each yielding a different magic state. These protocols avoid grafting by exploiting transversal operations on the surface code using non-local connectivity, allowing for a much lower post-selection rates in the expansion process. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our protocol achieves state-of-the-art infidelities and acceptance rates for magic state generation, on par with another recent proposal on the $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code, while still preserving the local geometry of the surface code. Moreover, in platforms such as cold atoms and trapped ions, where idle error rates are lower than two-qubit gate errors, we demonstrate that cultivation exhibits an even greater advantage, yielding an additional order-of-magnitude reduction in resource requirements. Lastly, we analyze the effect of erasure qubits on cultivation and show that \emph{algorithmically-relevant} infidelities can be achieved using only 9 erasure qubits on a distance-2 surface code with a single cultivation round.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Xu Lu, Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yintai Zhang, Aritra Sinha, Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga</p>
            <p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Mechanisms for Quantum Advantage in Global Optimization of Nonconvex Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan Herman, Guneykan Ozgul, Anuj Apte, Junhyung Lyle Kim, Anupam Prakash, Jiayu Shen, Shouvanik Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>We present new theoretical mechanisms for quantum speedup in the global optimization of nonconvex functions, expanding the scope of quantum advantage beyond traditional tunneling-based explanations. As our main building-block, we demonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of Schrödinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion. This correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with unique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original potential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schrödinger operators with a WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these ideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves provably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex functions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains polynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential time and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial runtimes. These results leverage novel non-asymptotic results in semiclassical analysis. Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic hypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately perturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while off-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to prior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the geometry of barriers between local minima. Our theoretical claims about classical algorithm runtimes are supported by rigorous analysis and comprehensive numerical benchmarking. These findings establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for quantum advantage in continuous optimization and open new research directions connecting quantum algorithms, stochastic processes, and semiclassical analysis.</p>

            <h2>Quantum feature-map learning with reduced resource overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Jäger, Philipp Elsässer, Elham Torabian</p>
            <p>Current quantum computers require algorithms that use limited resources economically. In quantum machine learning, success hinges on quantum feature maps, which embed classical data into the state space of qubits. We introduce Quantum Feature-Map Learning via Analytic Iterative Reconstructions (Q-FLAIR), an algorithm that reduces quantum resource overhead in iterative feature-map circuit construction. It shifts workloads to a classical computer via partial analytic reconstructions of the quantum model, using only a few evaluations. For each probed gate addition to the ansatz, the simultaneous selection and optimization of the data feature and weight parameter is then entirely classical. Integrated into quantum neural network and quantum kernel support vector classifiers, Q-FLAIR shows state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Since resource overhead decouples from feature dimension, we train a quantum model on a real IBM device in only four hours, surpassing 90% accuracy on the full-resolution MNIST dataset (784 features, digits 3 vs 5). Such results were previously unattainable, as the feature dimension prohibitively drives hardware demands for fixed and search costs for adaptive ansätze. By rethinking feature-map learning beyond black-box optimization, this work takes a concrete step toward enabling quantum machine learning for real-world problems and near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Precision sensing and imaging of weak static magnetic fields are crucial for a variety of emerging nanoscale applications. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide exceptional AC magnetic field sensitivity with nanoscale spatial resolution, their sensitivity to static (DC) magnetic fields is fundamentally limited by the short dephasing time (T2*) due to spin-spin interactions. In this work, we present a novel hybrid sensing approach that integrates a soft ferromagnetic microwire with a single near-surface NV center to amplify its response to external static magnetic fields. This hybrid configuration achieves a DC magnetic field sensitivity of 63 nT/sqrt(Hz) for a single NV center - about 500 times greater than conventional inhomogeneous broadening- or T2*-limited magnetometry, with potential for further enhancement. The compact and highly sensitive nature of this sensor opens new opportunities for quantum sensing applications involving the detection of static or slowly varying magnetic fields across diverse scientific and technological domains.</p>

Quantum Hamiltonian simulation provides a framework to encode PDEs into unitary time evolution and has potential for scalable electromagnetic analysis.

A key bottleneck is the exponential growth of Hamiltonian terms for complex geometries; we examine this issue and show that logical compression can substantially mitigate it, especially for periodic or symmetric structures. As a proof of concept, we simulate optical wave propagation through a metalens and illustrate that the method can capture wavefront shaping and focusing behavior, suggesting its applicability to design optimization tasks. This work highlights the feasibility of Hamiltonian-based quantum simulation for photonic systems and identifies structural conditions favorable for efficient execution.</p>

            <p>The diamond sensor has emerged as a promising platform for quantum sensing, enabling the estimation of physical quantities -- such as microwave~(MW) field -- with precision unattainable by classical counterpart. However, traditional diamond sensors suffer severe precision degradation when the signal MW is not resonant with the sensor transition frequency. Here, we propose and demonstrate a Floquet diamond sensor~(FDS) for high-precision off-resonant MW amplitude sensing without attenuating the strength of the signal MW. The periodic driven field effectively induces an quasi-energy shift that matches the off-resonant MW frequency. The measurement precision of FDS is characterized by quantum Fisher information, which approaches the ultimate precision -- Heisenberg limit -- within the coherent time. Furthermore, the FDS exhibits robust tolerance to practical control errors and is compatible with dynamical coupling protocol, enabling a robust and high-sensitivity magnetic sensing. Our results confirm the quantum advantage of quantum sensing and provide a practical technology for high-precision off-resonant MW sensing.</p>

            <p>Broadband nonlinear optical devices play a critical role in both classical and quantum optics. Here, we design and fabricate a 6.82-mm-long step-chirped periodically poled lithium niobate~(CPPLN) waveguide on lithium niobate on insulator, which enables quasi-phase matching over a broad bandwidth for second-harmonic generation~(SHG) and spontaneous parametric down-conversion~(SPDC). The SHG achieves an average efficiency of 54.4\%/W/cm$^2$ over the first-harmonic wavelength range of 1510~nm-1620~nm, paving the way for realizing SPDC across a wide range of pump wavelengths. For SPDC, by tuning the pump wavelength to 775~nm, 780~nm, and 785~nm, we achieve broadband photon-pair generation with a maximum full bandwidth and brightness up to 99~THz~(846~nm) and 20~GHz/mW/nm, respectively.

            <p>The polarization-entangled photon source (PEPS) at non-degenerated wavelengths is pivotal to connect quantum systems working at different wavelengths, with the assistance of quantum teleportation. Here, a compact Sagnac-type photon source is designed and demonstrated, in which two photons with wavelengths at 810 and 1550~nm are highly entangled in polarization degree of freedom. The two photons are generated from a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal pumped with a 532~nm continuous-wave laser, via type-0 nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The polarization of three lights is rotated by a single periscope, which makes the Sagnac interferometer compact and stable. The generated two photons are with high brightness of $3\times10^4$ pairs/s/mW, which are highly entangled with fidelity of $0.985\pm0.002$. The entanglement is verified by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with $\mathcal S =2.756\pm0.007$. Finally, teleportation is demonstrated with this nondegenerate source, in which photonic states at 810~nm is teleported to 1550~nm with fidelity of $0.955\pm0.003$.</p>

            <p>Quantum resources exist in a hierarchy of multiple levels. At order zero, quantum states are transformed by linear maps (channels, or gates) in order to perform computations or simulate other states. At order one, gates and channels are transformed by linear maps (superchannels) in order to simulate other gates. To develop a full hierarchy of quantum resources, beyond those first two orders, and to account for the fact that quantum protocols can interconvert resources of different orders, we need a theoretical framework that addresses all orders in a uniform manner. We introduce a framework based on a system of types, which label the different kinds of objects that are present at different orders. We equip the framework with a parallel product operation that modifies and generalizes the tensor product so as to be operationally meaningful for maps of distinct and arbitrary orders. Finally, we introduce a family of convex cones that generalize the notion of complete positivity to all orders, with the aim of characterizing the objects that are physically admissible, facilitating an operational treatment of quantum objects at any order.</p>

            <p>Entanglement witnessing is essential for quantum technologies such as computing, key distribution, and networking. Conventional bulk-optics methods require sequential reconfiguration across multiple polarization bases, limiting efficiency and scalability. We propose a metasurface-based analyzer that performs dual-basis (\sigma_z and \sigma_y) projections simultaneously by mapping them to orthogonal spatial modes. This allows direct access to the commuting two-photon correlators \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle and \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle required for entanglement witnessing. The metasurface design employs meta-atoms engineered to impart independent linear and circular phase delays through anisotropy and geometric control, resulting in polarization-dependent beam deflection that separates H/V and R/L components. This approach halves the measurement overhead compared to sequential analysis while offering a compact, integrable platform for chip-scale quantum photonics. The proposed scheme provides a path toward efficient entanglement verification with applications in quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and scalable quantum networks.</p>

Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors.

            <p>Bosonic codes, leveraging infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for redundancy, offer great potential for encoding quantum information. However, the realization of a practical continuous-variable bosonic code that can simultaneously correct both single-photon loss and dephasing errors remains elusive, primarily due to the absence of exactly orthogonal codewords and the lack of an experiment-friendly state preparation scheme. Here, we propose a code based on the superposition of squeezed Fock states with an error-correcting capability that scales as $\propto\exp(-7r)$, where $r$ is the squeezing level. The codewords remain orthogonal at all squeezing levels. The Pauli-X operator acts as a rotation in phase space is an error-transparent gate, preventing correctable errors from propagating outside the code space during logical operations. In particular, this code achieves high-precision error correction for both single-photon loss and dephasing, even at moderate squeezing levels. Building on this code, we develop quantum error correction schemes that exceed the break-even threshold, supported by analytical derivations of all necessary quantum gates. Our code offers a competitive alternative to previous encodings for quantum computation using continuous bosonic qubits.</p>

The detection is based on balanced homodyne detectors on the same photonic chip with a bandwidth of up to 12.5 GHz, which allows room-temperature operation. A loss-equivalent analysis method compensates for optical losses and system noises.

By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term quantum computers and quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Optomechanical Entanglement and Mechanical Squeezing by the Synergistic Effect of Quadratic Optomechanical Coupling and Coherent Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Feng Jiao, Ruo-Chen Wang, Jing-Xue Liu, Hui-Lai Zhang, Ya-Chuan Liang, Yan Wang, Le-Man Kuang, Hui Jing</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement and squeezing associated with the motions of massive mechanical oscillators play an essential role in both fundamental science and emerging quantum technologies, yet realizing such macroscopic nonclassical states remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve strong optomechanical entanglement and mechanical squeezing in a membrane-embedded cavity optomechanical system incorporating a coherent feedback loop, where the membrane interacts with the cavity mode through both linear and quadratic optomechanical couplings. This hybrid optomechanical architecture offers a flexible tunability of intrinsic system parameters, thus allowing the membrane to be stiffened or softened through tuning the sign of quadratic optomechanical coupling and the cavity decay rate to be reduced via feedback control. Exploiting these unique features, we demonstrate that optomechanical entanglement can be substantially enhanced with positive coupling sign and suitable feedback parameters, while strong mechanical squeezing beyond the 3dB limit is simultaneously achieved over a broad parameter range with negative coupling sign, reaching squeezing degree above 10dB under optimized conditions. Our proposal, establishing an all-optical method for generating highly entangled or squeezed states in cavity optomechanical systems, opens up a new route to explore macroscopic quantum effects and to advance quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Subgradient Estimation for Conditional Value-at-Risk Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasilis Skarlatos, Nikos Konofaos</p>
            <p>Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a leading tail-risk measure in finance, central to both regulatory and portfolio optimization frameworks. Classical estimation of CVaR and its gradients relies on Monte Carlo simulation, incurring $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy. In this work, we design and analyze a quantum subgradient oracle for CVaR minimization based on amplitude estimation. Via a tripartite proposition, we show that CVaR subgradients can be estimated with $O(1/\epsilon)$ quantum queries, even when the Value-at-Risk (VaR) threshold itself must be estimated. We further quantify the propagation of estimation error from the VaR stage to CVaR gradients and derive convergence rates of stochastic projected subgradient descent using this oracle. Our analysis establishes a near-quadratic improvement in query complexity over classical Monte Carlo. Numerical experiments with simulated quantum circuits confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robustness to threshold estimation noise. This constitutes the first rigorous complexity analysis of quantum subgradient methods for tail-risk minimization.</p>

            <h2>Collusion-Resistant Quantum Secure Key Leasing Beyond Decryption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuyuki Kitagawa, Ryo Nishimaki, Nikhil Pappu</p>
            <p>Secure key leasing (SKL) enables the holder of a secret key for a cryptographic function to temporarily lease the key using quantum information. Later, the recipient can produce a deletion certificate, which proves that they no longer have access to the secret key. The security guarantee ensures that even a malicious recipient cannot continue to evaluate the function, after producing a valid deletion certificate. Most prior work considers an adversarial recipient that obtains a single leased key, which is insufficient for many applications. In the more realistic collusion-resistant setting, security must hold even when polynomially many keys are leased (and subsequently deleted). However, achieving collusion-resistant SKL from standard assumptions remains poorly understood, especially for functionalities beyond decryption. We improve upon this situation by introducing new pathways for constructing collusion-resistant SKL. Our main contributions are as follows: - A generalization of quantum-secure collusion-resistant traitor tracing called multi-level traitor tracing (MLTT), and a compiler that transforms an MLTT scheme for a primitive X into a collusion-resistant SKL scheme for primitive X. - The first bounded collusion-resistant SKL scheme for PRFs, assuming LWE. - A compiler that upgrades any single-key secure SKL scheme for digital signatures into one with unbounded collusion-resistance, assuming OWFs. - A compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant SKL schemes with classical certificates to ones having verification-query resilience, assuming OWFs.</p>

            <p>We extend the scheme of neutral atom Rydberg $C_Z$ gate based on double sequence of adiabatic pulses applied symmetrically to both atoms using counterdiabatic driving in the regime of Rydberg blockade. This provides substantial reducing of quantum gate operation times (at least five times) compared to previously proposed adiabatic schemes, which is important for high-fidelity entanglement due to finite Rydberg lifetimes. We analyzed schemes of adiabatic rapid passage with counterdiabatic driving for single-photon, two-photon and three-photon schemes of Rydberg excitation for rubidium and cesium atoms. We designed laser pulse profiles with fully analytical shapes and calculated the Bell fidelity taking into account atomic lifetimes and finite blockade strengths. We show that the upper limit of the Bell fidelity reaches ${\mathcal F}\simeq0.9999$ in a room-temperature environment.</p>

            <p>Noncommutativity of observables is a central feature of quantum physics. It plays a fundamental role in the formulation of the uncertainty principle for complementary variables and strongly affects the laws of thermodynamics for systems with noncommuting, that is, non-Abelian, conserved quantities. We here derive nonequilibrium generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics in the form of fluctuation relations, both for mechanically and thermally driven quantum systems. We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics. These findings demonstrate that noncommutativity maybe a useful thermodynamic resource.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joaquín López-Suárez, Michalis Skotiniotis</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of imaging two partially coherent sources and derive the ultimate quantum limits for estimating all relevant parameters, namely their separation, relative intensity, as well as their coherence factor. We show that the separation of the two sources can be super-resolved over the entire range of all other pertinent parameters (with the exception of fully coherent sources), with anti-correlated sources furnishing the largest possible gain in estimation precision, using a binary spatial mode demultiplexing measurement positioned at the center of intensity of the joint point spread function for the two sources. In the sub-Rayleigh limit, we show that both the relative intensity, as well as the real part of the coherence factor, can be optimally estimated by a simple boson counting measurement, making it possible to optimally estimate the separation, relative intensity and real coherence factor of the sources simultaneously. Within the same limit, we show that the imaging problem can be effectively reduced to one where all relevant parameters are encoded in the Bloch vector of a two-dimensional system. Using such a model we find that indirect estimation schemes, which attempt to extract estimates of the separation of the two sources by measuring the purity of the corresponding state of the two-level system, yield suboptimal estimation precision for all non-zero values of the coherence factor.</p>

            <h2>Information-thermodynamic bounds on precision in interacting quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Honma, Tan Van Vu</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost, indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression.</p>

            <p>A qubit, or quantum bit, is conventionally defined as "a physical system for storing information that is capable of existing in either of two quantum states or in a superposition of both". In this paper, we examine the simple question of whether two distinct levels, each consisting of multiply degenerate sub-states, could serve as a practical quantum bit. We explore this idea using a well-characterized atomic system of the kind employed in several quantum computing implementations. We approximate the atom as a two-level system without degeneracy lifting in the magnetic quantum number while using the angular momentum addition rules to select the desired state transition. We find that, in the continuous presence of the field, the atom still undergoes Rabi oscillations, which are suitable for quantum gate construction. In addition, we compute the average fidelity in quantum gate performance for a single degenerate atom and postulate the required form of two-atom interaction to construct a controlled Z gate.</p>

            <p>The commutative depth model allows gates that commute with each other to be performed in parallel. We show how to compute Clifford operations in constant commutative depth more efficiently than was previously known. Bravyi, Maslov, and Nam [Phys. Rev.

We show that the Prefix Sum problem can be computed in commutative depth 16 and size $O(n \log n)$, improving on the previous depth 18 and size $O(n^2)$ bounds. We also show that, for arbitrary Cliffords, the commutative depth bound can be reduced to 16. Finally, we show some lower bounds: that there exist Cliffords whose commutative depth is at least 4; and that there exist Cliffords for which any constant commutative depth circuit has size $\Omega(n^2)$.</p>

This transform, which maps basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier transform. Our algorithm is based on a method to exponentially fast forward the evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which significantly improves over prior art. We apply this Hermite transform to give examples of provable quantum query advantage in property testing and learning. In particular, we show how to efficiently test the property of being close to a low- degree in the Hermite basis when inputs are sampled from the Gaussian distribution, and how to solve a Gaussian analogue of the Goldreich-Levin learning task efficiently. We also comment on other potential uses of this transform to simulating time dynamics of quantum systems in the continuum.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop new pulse designs and embedding strategies to improve the analog quantum subroutines of hybrid column generation (CG) algorithms based on neutral-atoms quantum computers (NAQCs). These strategies are designed to improve the quality and diversity of the samples generated. We apply these to an important combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in logistics, namely the fleet assignment. Depending on the instance tested, our quantum protocol has a performance that is either comparable or worse than the best classical method tested, both in terms of the number of iterations and final objective value. We identify the cause of these suboptimal solutions as a result of our quantum protocol often generating high-quality but degenerate samples. We address this limitation by introducing a greedy post-processing technique, Make\_Diff, which applies bit-wise modifications to degenerate samples in order to return a non-degenerate set. With this modification, our quantum protocol becomes competitive with an exact solver for the subproblem, all the while being resilient to state preparation and measurements (SPAM) errors. We also compare our CG scheme with a Gurobi solver and find that it performs better on over 50\% of our synthetic instances and that, despite Gurobi having a more extensive runtime. These improvements and benchmarks herald the potential of deploying hybrid CG schemes on NISQ devices for industrially relevant CO problems.</p>

            <p>We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjan Cornelissen</p>
            <p>In this work, we generalize the recently-introduced graph composition framework to the non-boolean setting. A quantum algorithm in this framework is represented by a hypergraph, where each hyperedge is adjacent to multiple vertices. The input and output to the quantum algorithm is represented by a set of boundary vertices, and the hyperedges act like switches, connecting the input vertex to the output that the algorithm computes. Apart from generalizing the graph composition framework, our new proposed framework unifies the quantum divide and conquer framework, the decision-tree framework, and the unified quantum walk search framework. For the decision trees, we additionally construct a quantum algorithm from an improved weighting scheme in the non-boolean case. For quantum walk search, we show how our techniques naturally allow for amortization of the subroutines' costs. Previous work showed how one can speed up ``detection'' of marked vertices by amortizing the costs of the quantum walk. In this work, we extend these results to the setting of ``finding'' such marked vertices, albeit in some restricted settings. Along the way, we provide a novel analysis of irreducible, reversible Markov processes, by linear-algebraically connecting its effective resistance to the random walk operator. This significantly simplifies the algorithmic implementation of the quantum walk search algorithm, achieves an amortization speed-up for quantum walks over Johnson graphs, avoids the need for quantum fast-forwarding, and removes the log-factors from the query complexity statements.</p>

            <p>Quantum cryptographic definitions are often sensitive to the number of copies of the cryptographic states revealed to an adversary. Making definitional changes to the number of copies accessible to an adversary can drastically affect various aspects including the computational hardness, feasibility, and applicability of the resulting cryptographic scheme.

To address this, we present a generic approach to boost single-copy security to multi-copy security and apply this approach to many settings. As a consequence, we obtain the following new results: -One-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators, for any fixed polynomial t. -One-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys, for any fixed polynomial t. -Assuming indistinguishability obfuscation and other standard cryptographic assumptions, there exist identical-copy secure unclonable primitives such as public-key quantum money and quantum copy-protection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tenzan Araki, Joseph F. Goodwin, Zhenyu Cai</p>
            <p>Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates. Through classical post-processing, H-VEC virtually filters the error channel, projecting the noise into pure Y-type errors that are subsequently corrected using the classical code's native decoding algorithm. We demonstrate this by applying H-VEC to the classical repetition code. Under a code-capacity noise model, the resulting protocol not only provides full quantum protection but also achieves an exponentially stronger error suppression (in distance) than the original classical code, and even larger improvements over the surface code while using much fewer qubits, simpler checks and straight-forward decoding. H-VEC comes with a sampling overhead due to its post-processing nature. It represents a new hybrid quantum error correction and mitigation framework that redefines the trade-offs between physical hardware requirements and classical processing for error suppression.</p>

            <p>One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently sampleable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In that case, we can focus on efficient verification with efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verifications of classical/quantum distributions and classical/quantum cryptography, and show the following results: (i) Every quantumly samplable distribution is verifiable with a $\mathbf{P^{PP}}$ algorithm. (ii) If one-way functions exist, then no sufficiently random classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iii) If one-way functions do not exist, then every classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iv) If QEFID pairs exist, then there exists a quantumly samplable distribution which is not efficiently verifiable. (v) If one-way puzzles do not exist, then it is possible to verify sampling-based quantum advantage with a efficient quantum computer.</p>

We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling.

            <p>The quantum control of spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) holds promise for the targeted manipulation of magnetic field effects, with potential applications ranging from the design of noise-resilient quantum information processors to genetically encodable quantum sensors. However, achieving precise handles over the intricate interplay between coherent electron spin dynamics and incoherent relaxation processes in photoexcited radical-pair reactions requires tractable approaches for numerically obtaining controls for large, complex open quantum systems. Employing techniques relying on full Liouville-space propagators becomes computationally infeasible for large spin systems of realistic complexity. Here, we demonstrate how a control engineering approach based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) can offer a viable alternative by reporting on the successful application of PMP-optimal control to steer the coherent and incoherent spin dynamics of noisy radical pairs. This enables controls for prototypical radical-pair models that exhibit robustness in the face of relevant noise sources and paves the way to incoherent control of radical-pair spin dynamics.</p>

Inspired by classical work by Barak, Hardt and Kale, our QuantumBoost algorithm achieves the best known runtime over other boosting methods through two innovations. First, it uses a quantum algorithm to compute approximate Bregman projections faster. Second, it combines this with a lazy projection strategy, a technique from convex optimization where projections are performed infrequently rather than every iteration. To our knowledge, QuantumBoost is the first algorithm, classical or quantum, to successfully adopt a lazy projection strategy in the context of boosting.</p>

            <p>Simulating time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians is a compelling application of quantum computers because it lies at the core of predicting the properties of materials and molecules. Fermions can be simulated on qubit-based quantum computers using a fermion-to-qubit mapping, subject to an overhead -- the circuit depth on a qubit quantum computer divided by that on a quantum computer built from native fermionic modes -- at worst scaling linearly with the number of modes $N$. Existing approaches that lower this depth overhead usually trade it for space, using $O(N)$ ancilla qubits. We exponentially reduce the worst-case overhead of ancilla-free fermion-to-qubit mappings to $O(\log^2 N)$ by constructing circuits that perform any fermionic permutation on qubits in the Jordan-Wigner encoding in depth $O(\log^2 N)$. We also show that our result generalizes to permutations in any product-preserving ternary tree fermionic encoding. When introducing $O(N)$ ancillas and mid-circuit measurement and feedforward, the overhead reduces to $O(\log N)$. Finally, we show that our scheme can be used to implement the fermionic fast Fourier transform, a key subroutine in chemistry simulation, with overhead $\Theta(\log N)$ without ancillas and $\Theta(1)$ with ancillas, improving exponentially over the best previously known ancilla-free algorithm with overhead scaling linearly with $N$. Our results show that simulating fermions with qubit quantum computers comes at a much lower asymptotic overhead than previously thought.</p>

In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an atomtronic transistor composed of a triple-well potential -- source, gate, and drain -- modeled by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We systematically explore the dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling.</p>

            <h2>Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenhaoyue Wang, Carlos J. Garcia-Cervera, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</p>

            <p>The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST) experiment uses superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors to search for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) with recoil spectroscopy of the $\mathbf{^7}$Be EC decay into $\mathbf{^7}$Li. A pulsed UV laser is used to calibrate the STJs throughout the experiment with $\sim$20 meV precision. Phase-III of the BeEST experiment revealed a systematic calibration discrepancy between STJs. We found these artifacts to be caused by resistive crosstalk and by intensity variations of the calibration laser. For phase-IV of the BeEST experiment, we have removed the crosstalk by designing the STJ array so that each pixel has its own ground wire. We now also use a more stable UV laser for calibration. The new STJ arrays were fabricated at STAR Cryoelectronics and tested at LLNL and FRIB. They have the same high energy resolution of $\sim$1\textendash2~eV in the energy range of interest below 100~eV as before, and they no longer exhibit the earlier calibration artifacts. We discuss the design changes and the STJ array performance for the next phase of the BeEST experiment.</p>

            <h2>High-spin magnetic ground states of neutral dopant clusters in semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rhine Samajdar, Haonan Zhou, R. N. Bhatt</p>
            <p>High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.</p>

            <p>A key challenge for quantum photonic technologies based on spin qubits is the creation of optically active defects in photonic resonators. Several of the most promising defects for quantum applications are hosted in diamond, and are commonly created through ion implantation and annealing at high temperatures and high vacuum. However, the impact of annealing on photonic resonator quality factor, a critical parameter governing their coupling to defects, has not been reported. In this work, we characterize the effect of annealing at temperatures >1200°C in high vacuum on the quality factors of diamond microdisk resonators. We investigate the optical losses associated with a non-diamond layer formed during annealing, and use Raman spectroscopy to analyze the resonator surface morphology and demonstrate that tri-acid cleaning can restore their optical quality factors. These results show the viability of creating defects in pre-fabricated diamond resonators without degrading their optical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amanda Gatto Lamas, Jacopo Gliozzi, Taylor L. Hughes</p>
            <p>We extend a recently defined measure of symmetry breaking, the entanglement asymmetry, to higher-form symmetries. In particular, we focus on Abelian topological order in two dimensions, which spontaneously breaks a 1-form symmetry. Using the toric code as a primary example, we compute the entanglement asymmetry and compare it to the topological entanglement entropy. We find that while the two quantities are not strictly equivalent, both are sub-leading corrections to the area law and can serve as order parameters for the topological phase. We generalize our results to non-chiral Abelian topological order and express the maximal entanglement asymmetry in terms of the quantum dimension. Finally, we discuss how the scaling of entanglement asymmetry correctly detects topological order in the deformed toric code, where 1-form symmetry breaking persists even in a trivial phase.</p>

            <p>Single nuclear spins in silicon are a promising resource for quantum technologies due to their long coherence times and excellent control fidelities. Qubits and qudits have been encoded on donor nuclei, with successful demonstrations of Bell states and quantum memories on the spin-1/2 $^{31}$P and cat-qubits on the spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nuclei. Isoelectronic nuclear spins coupled to gate-defined quantum dots, such as the naturally occurring $^{29}$Si isotope, possess no additional charge and allow for the coupled electron to be shuttled without destroying the nuclear spin coherence. Here, we demonstrate the coupling and readout of a spin-9/2 $^{73}$Ge nuclear spin to a gate-defined quantum dot in SiMOS. The $^{73}$Ge nucleus was implanted by isotope-selective ion-implantation. We observe the hyperfine interaction (HFI) to the coupled quantum dot electron and are able to tune it from 180 kHz to 350 kHz, through the voltages applied to the lateral gate electrodes. This work lays the foundation for future spin control experiments on the spin-9/2 qudit as well as more advanced experiments such as entanglement distribution between distant nuclear spins or repeated weak measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhilong Liu, Wentao Liu, Xiaofang Liu, Jieci Wang</p>
            <p>Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Cheng Liu, Lei-Hua Liu, Bichu Li, Hai-Qing Zhang, Peng-Zhang He</p>
            <p>Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daichi Imagawa, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We investigate the phenomenon of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin system, with particular attention to how it depends on the spatial profile and operator content of the applied perturbation, as well as its robustness against increase of amplitude and temporal discretization. Motivated by recent theoretical proposals linking such response patterns to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we numerically analyze the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit. In contrast, perturbations involving other spin components produce conventional propagating excitations without localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the response remains qualitatively robust when the time-dependent perturbation is approximated by a piecewise-linear function, highlighting the practical relevance of our findings for quantum simulation platforms with limited temporal resolution. Our results clarify the operator dependence of emergent bulk-like dynamics in critical spin chains and offer guidance for probing holographic physics in experimental settings.</p>

            <p>Gluing theorem for random unitaries [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] have found numerous applications, including designing low depth random unitaries [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025], random unitaries in ${\sf QAC0}$ [Foxman, Parham, Vasconcelos, Yuen'25] and generically shortening the key length of pseudorandom unitaries [Ananth, Bostanci, Gulati, Lin EUROCRYPT'25]. We present an alternate method of combining Haar random unitaries from the gluing lemma from [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] that is secure against adversaries with inverse query access to the joined unitary. As a consequence, we show for the first time that strong pseudorandom unitaries can generically have their length extended, and can be constructed using only $O(n^{1/c})$ bits of randomness, for any constant $c$, if any family of strong pseudorandom unitaries exists.</p>

            <p>Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.</p>

            <p>In the context of entanglement in relativistic $2\to 2$ scattering described by a perturbative $S$-matrix, we derive analytically the concurrence for a mixed final state of two qubits corresponding to a discrete quantum number of the scattered particles. Given an initial product state, the derived concurrence depends at the leading order on the real part of the inelastic forward amplitude and the initial state only. We also point out that the real part of the forward amplitude provides a subleading correction to the linearized entropy, reducing it by an amount that, for a computational-basis state, is equivalent to the relative entropy of coherence. We illustrate our findings with two examples of phenomenological interest: high-energy scattering of two scalar fields in the two-Higgs doublet model, and high-energy electron-positron annihilation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Chandra, Mahbub Rahaman, Soumyabroto Majumder, Analabha Roy, Sujit Sarkar</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</p>

            <p>Using the gauge-gravity duality, we study the electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in holographic plasma. The model we employ is the D(-1)-D3 brane system in which the D(-1)-branes correspond to the instantons in holography. To take into account the flavored quarks, the coincident probe D7-branes as flavors are embedded into the bulk geometry so that the effective electromagnetic Lagrangian with flavors corresponds to the action of the D7-branes according to gauge-gravity duality. We numerically evaluate the vacuum decay rate, the critical electric field and the V-A curve of the vacuum by using the D7-brane action with various values of the electromagnetic field. It implies the particles in the plasma acquire an effective mass in the presence of instantons as it is expected in the quantum field theory, and the plasma trends to become insulating when the electric field is small. This work reveals the relation between electromagnetic and instantonic properties of the vacuum in the plasma.</p>

            <p>We present the first construction of a computational Certified Deletion Property (CDP) achievable with classical communication, derived from the compilation of the non-local Magic Square Game (MSG). We leverage the KLVY compiler to transform the non-local MSG into a 2-round interactive protocol, rigorously demonstrating that this compilation preserves the game-specific CDP. Previously, the quantum value and rigidity of the compiled game were investigated. We emphasize that we are the first to investigate CDP (local randomness in [Fu and Miller, Phys. Rev. A 97, 032324 (2018)]) for the compiled game. Then, we combine this CDP with the framework [Kitagawa, Morimae, and Yamakawa, Eurocrypt 2025] to construct Secure Key Leasing with classical Lessor (cSKL). SKL enables the Lessor to lease the secret key to the Lessee and verify that a quantum Lessee has indeed deleted the key. In this paper, we realize cSKL for PKE, PRF, and digital signature. Compared to prior works for cSKL, we realize cSKL for PRF and digital signature for the first time. In addition, we succeed in weakening the assumption needed to construct cSKL.</p>

            <p>The simplest, algebraic quantum-electrodynamical corrections, due to the double-negative energy subspace and instantaneous interactions, are computed to the no-pair Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) energy of two-spin-1/2-fermion systems. Numerical results are reported for two-electron atoms with a clamped nucleus and positronium-like genuine two-particle systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian. The numerical results have an $\alpha$ fine-structure constant dependence that is in excellent agreement with the known $\alpha^3E_\mathrm{h}\$-order double-pair correction of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics.</p>

The crucial influence of electron correlation on the validity of these approximations is discussed, and we review how PPP model exact calculations have enabled a deeper understanding of conjugated polymer systems. More recent usage of the PPP Hamiltonian includes its application in high-throughput screening activities to the inverse design problem, which we illustrate here for two specific fields of technological interest: singlet fission and singlet-triplet inverted energy gap molecules.

            <p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p>

            <p>Horn's problem is concerned with characterizing the eigenvalues $(a,b,c)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C)$ satisfying the constraint $A+B=C$ and forming the edges of a triangle in the space of Hermitian matrices. It has deep connections to tensor product invariants, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, geometric invariant theory and the intersection theory of Schubert varieties. This paper concerns the tetrahedral Horn problem which aims to characterize the tuples of eigenvalues $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ forming the edges of a tetrahedron, and thus satisfying the constraints $A+B=C$, $B+D=F$, $D+C=E$ and $A+F=E$. Here we derive new inequalities satisfied by the Schur-polynomials of such eigenvalues and, using eigenvalue estimation techniques from quantum information theory, prove their satisfaction up to degree $k$ implies the existence of approximate solutions with error $O(\ln k / k)$. Moreover, the existence of these tetrahedra is related to the semiclassical asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the unitary group $U(n)$, which are maps between multiplicity spaces that encode the associativity relation for tensor products of irreducible representations. Using our techniques, we prove the asymptotics of norms of these $6j$-symbols are either inverse-polynomial or exponential depending on whether there exists such tetrahedra of Hermitian matrices.</p>

            <p>We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Folkers, A. van Rossum, A. Brinkman, H. K. E. Stadermann</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is difficult to teach because it is microscopic and non classical. We present interactive electronic dice that simulate core quantum ideas through haptic interaction and visual feedback. Each die represents a six state system with a superposition display and basis dependent measurement. A pair of dice can be prepared in an entangled mode that yields anti correlated outcomes which sum to seven when measured in the same colour basis while remaining uncorrelated across different bases. The platform supports classroom demonstrations from basic superposition and measurement to simplified quantum key distribution with single die and entanglement based protocols. The design uses standard components, two custom PCBs, orientation sensing, cryptographic quality randomness, and low power wireless proximity detection. All hardware files and code are open source to enable adoption. Initial implementations with university and secondary school audiences suggest that the tangible and visual nature of the dice helps learners form intuitive models of superposition, measurement, and entanglement correlations.</p>

            <h2>Casimir Stabilization of Fluctuating Electronic Nematic Order</h2>

            <p>Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.</p>

            <p>The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach can describe the reduced dynamics of a system simultaneously coupled to multiple bosonic and fermionic environments. The complexity of exactly describing the system-environment interaction with the HEOM method usually results in time-consuming calculations and a large memory cost. Here, we introduce an open-source software package called HierarchicalEOM$.$jl: a Julia framework integrating the HEOM approach. HierarchicalEOM$.$jl features a collection of methods to compute bosonic and fermionic spectra, stationary states, and the full dynamics in the extended space of all auxiliary density operators (ADOs). The required handling of the ADOs multi-indexes is achieved through a user-friendly interface. We exemplify the functionalities of the package by analyzing a single impurity Anderson model, and an ultra-strongly coupled charge-cavity system interacting with bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. HierarchicalEOM$.$jl achieves a significant speedup with respect to the corresponding method in the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), upon which this package is founded.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Nagaoka, Akio Fujiwara</p>
            <p>In this paper we study the autoparallelity w.r.t. the e-connection for an information-geometric structure called the SLD structure, which consists of a Riemannian metric and mutually dual e- and m-connections, induced on the manifold of strictly positive density operators. Unlike the classical information geometry, the e-connection has non-vanishing torsion, which brings various mathematical difficulties. The notion of e-autoparallel submanifolds is regarded as a quantum version of exponential families in classical statistics, which is known to be characterized as statistical models having efficient estimators (unbiased estimators uniformly achieving the equality in the Cramer-Rao inequality). As quantum extensions of this classical result, we present two different forms of estimation-theoretical characterizations of the e-autoparallel submanifolds. We also give several results on the e-autoparallelity, some of which are valid for the autoparallelity w.r.t. an affine connection in a more general geometrical situation.</p>

            <p>Theoretically understanding and experimentally characterizing and modifying the underlying Hamiltonian of a quantum system is of utmost importance in achieving high-fidelity quantum gates for quantum computing. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical decoupling (DD) in characterizing and suppressing undesired two-qubit couplings as well as the underlying single-qubit decoherence, both significant hurdles to achieving precise quantum control and realizing quantum computing on many hardware prototypes. Through discrete search of dynamical decoupling sequences, we identify sequences that protect against decoherence and selectively target unwanted two-qubit interactions of general form. On a transmon-qubit-based superconducting quantum device, we identify separate white and 1/f noise components underlying the single-qubit decoherence and a static ZZ coupling between pairs of qubits. A family of syncopated dynamical decoupling sequences is found and their efficiency demonstrated in two-qubit benchmarking experiments. The syncopated decoupling technique significantly boosts performance in a realistic algorithmic quantum circuit.</p>

            <h2>Quantum State Preparation for Probability Distributions with Reflection Symmetry Using Matrix Product States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuichi Sano, Ikko Hamamura</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits for loading probability distributions into quantum states are essential subroutines in quantum algorithms used in physics, finance engineering, and machine learning. The ability to implement these with high accuracy in low-depth quantum circuits is a critical issue. We propose a novel quantum state preparation method for probability distribution with reflection symmetry using matrix product states. By considering reflection symmetry, our method reduces the entanglement of probability distributions and improves the accuracy of approximations by matrix product states. As a result, we improved the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix product states. Our approach, characterized by linear scalability with qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices. Also, our demonstration results reveal that the approximation accuracy in tensor networks depends heavily on the bond dimension, with minimal reliance on the number of qubits. Our method is demonstrated for a normal distribution encoded into 10 and 20 qubits on a real quantum processor.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, harnessing the power of qubits' superposition and entanglement for computational advantages over classical systems. However, scalability poses a primary challenge for these machines. By implementing a hybrid workflow between classical and quantum computing instances, D-Wave has succeeded in pushing this boundary to the realm of industrial use. Furthermore, they have recently opened up to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, expanding their applicability to many relevant problems in the field of optimisation. However, the extent of their suitability for diverse problem categories and their computational advantages remains unclear. This study conducts a comprehensive examination by applying a selection of diverse case studies to benchmark the performance of D-Wave's hybrid solver against that of industry-leading solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and IPOPT. The findings indicate that D-Wave's hybrid solver is currently most advantageous for integer quadratic objective functions and shows potential for quadratic constraints. To illustrate this, we applied it to a real-world energy problem, specifically the MILP unit commitment problem. While D-Wave can solve such problems, its performance has not yet matched that of its classical counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nilotpal Chakraborty, Roderich Moessner, Benoit Doucot</p>
            <p>A crucial ingredient for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is the construction of logical qubits with low error rates and intrinsic noise protection. We propose a cross-platform construction for such hardware-level noise-protection in which the qubits are protected from depolarizing (relaxation) and dephasing errors induced by local noise. These logical qubits arise from the entanglement between two internal degrees of freedom, hence - entanglemons. Our construction is based on the emergence of collective degrees of freedom from a generalized coherent state construction, similar in spirit to spin coherent states, of a set of such internally entangled units. These degrees of freedom, for a finite number of units, parametrize the quantized version of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}$P(3). The noise protection of the entanglemon qubit is then a consequence of a weakly coupled emergent degree of freedom arising due to the non-linear geometry of complex projective space. We present two simple models for entanglemons which are platform agnostic, provide varying levels of protection and in which the qubit basis states are the two lowest energy states with a higher energy gap to other states. We end by commenting on how entanglemons could be realized in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits and trapped ion platforms to possibly also quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene and quantum dots in semiconductors. The inherent noise protection in our models combined with the platform agnosticism highlights the potential of encoding information in additional weakly coupled emergent degrees of freedom arising in non-linear geometrical spaces and curved phase spaces, thereby proposing a different route to achieve scalable fault-tolerance.</p>

            <p>We construct a unitary oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QCMA}$ but quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) commitments and QCCC multiparty non-interactive key exchange exist. We also construct a unitary oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QMA}$, but quantum lightning (a stronger variant of quantum money) exists. This extends previous work by Kretschmer [Kretschmer, TQC22], which showed that there is a quantum oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QMA}$ but pseudorandm unitaries exist. We also show that (poly-round) QCCC key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution can all be used to build one-way puzzles. One-way puzzles are a version of ``quantum samplable'' one-wayness and are an intermediate primitive between pseudorandom state generators and EFI pairs, the minimal quantum primitive. In particular, one-way puzzles cannot exist if $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{PP}$. Our results together imply that aside from pseudorandom state generators, there is a large class of quantum cryptographic primitives which can exist even if $\mathbf{BQP} = \mathbf{QCMA}$, but are broken if $\mathbf{BQP} = \mathbf{PP}$. Furthermore, one-way puzzles are a minimal primitive for this class. We denote this class ``CountCrypt''.</p>

Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations through geometric rotations of surfaces in real space, opening a new approach to logical quantum computation. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups.

            <p>Aaronson, Atia, and Susskind (2020) established that efficiently mapping between quantum states $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\phi\rangle$ is computationally equivalent to distinguishing their superpositions $|\psi\rangle \pm |\phi\rangle$. We generalize this insight into a broader duality principle, wherein manipulating quantum states in one basis is equivalent to extracting their value in a complementary basis. This general duality principle states that the ability to implement a unitary representation of a group is computationally equivalent to the ability to perform a Fourier subspace extraction from its irreducible representations. Building on our duality principle, we present the following applications: * We extend the construction of publicly-key quantum money of Zhandry (2024) from Abelian group actions to a construction of quantum lightning from non-Abelian group actions, and eliminate Zhandry's reliance on a black-box model for justifying security. Instead, we prove a direct reduction to a computational assumption -- the pre-action security of cryptographic group actions. Our construction is realizable with symmetric group actions, including those implicit in the McEliece cryptosystem. * We provide an alternative quantum lightning construction from one-way homomorphisms, with security holding under certain conditions. This scheme shows equivalence among four security notions: quantum lightning security, worst-case and average-case cloning security, and security against preparing a canonical state. * We formalize the notion of quantum fire, states that are efficiently clonable, but not efficiently telegraphable. These states can be spread like fire, provided they are kept alive quantumly and do not decohere. The only previously known construction relied on a unitary quantum oracle, whereas we present the first candidate construction of quantum fire using a classical oracle.</p>

This model is well-adapted for studying the role of symmetry in quantum speedups, extending a central notion of symmetric computation studied in the classical setting. Our results establish that symmetric quantum circuits are fundamentally more powerful than their classical counterparts. First, we give efficient symmetric circuits for key quantum techniques such as amplitude amplification, phase estimation and linear combination of unitaries. In addition, we show how the task of symmetric state preparation can be performed efficiently in several natural cases. Finally, we demonstrate an exponential separation in the symmetric setting for the problem XOR-SAT, which requires exponential-size symmetric classical circuits but can be solved by polynomial-size symmetric quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>The efficient optimization of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is critical for their successful application in quantum computing. The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method, which leverages the geometry of quantum state space, has demonstrated improved convergence compared to standard gradient descent [Quantum 4, 269 (2020)]. In this work, we introduce the Modified Conjugate Quantum Natural Gradient (CQNG), an optimization algorithm that integrates QNG with principles from the nonlinear conjugate-gradient method. Unlike QNG, which employs a fixed learning rate, CQNG dynamically adjusts its hyperparameters at each step, enhancing both efficiency and flexibility. Numerical simulations show that CQNG achieves faster convergence and reduces quantum-resource requirements compared to QNG across various optimization scenarios, even when strict conjugacy conditions are not fully satisfied--hence the term ``Modified Conjugate.'' These results highlight CQNG as a promising optimization technique for improving the performance of VQAs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony Micciche, Feroz Ahmed Mian, Anasua Chatterjee, Andrew McGregor, Stefan Krastanov</p>
            <p>The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error-correction codes, which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. It is therefore timely to explore error correction architectures consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. Upon such an architecture, we develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a reduced number of shuttling operations. We demonstrate how column-regular qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that is exactly equal to the column weight of the code when Shor-style syndrome extraction is used. We provide tables stating the number of required shuttles for many contemporary codes of interest. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for general codes, even when using Shor syndrome extraction. We also discuss how one could get around this by placing blanks in the ancilla array to achieve minimal shuttles with Shor syndrome extraction on any CSS code, at the cost of longer ancilla arrays</p>

            <p>Understanding the effects of noise on quantum computations is fundamental to the development of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. Simulation tools are essential for quantitatively modelling these effects, yet unless artificial restrictions are placed on the circuit or noise model, accurately modelling noisy quantum computations is an extremely challenging task due to unfavourable scaling of required computational resources. Tensor network methods offer a viable solution for simulating computations that generate limited entanglement or that have noise models which yield low gate fidelities. However, in the most interesting regime of entangling circuits (with high gate fidelities) relevant for error correction and mitigation tensor network simulations often achieve poor accuracy. In this work we develop and numerically test a method for significantly improving the accuracy of tensor network simulations of noisy quantum circuits in the low-noise (i.e. high gate-fidelity) regime. Our method comes with the advantages that it (i) allows for the simulation of quantum circuits under generic types of noise model, (ii) is especially tailored to the low-noise regime, and (iii) retains the benefits of tensor network scaling, enabling efficient simulations of large numbers of qubits. We build upon the observations that adding extra noise to a quantum circuit makes it easier to simulate with tensor networks, and that the results can later be reliably extrapolated back to the low-noise regime of interest. These observations form the basis for a novel emulation technique that we call non-zero noise extrapolation, in analogy to the quantum error mitigation technique of zero-noise extrapolation.</p>

            <p>We present EHands, a quantum-native protocol for implementing multivariable polynomial transformations on quantum processors. The protocol introduces four fundamental, reversible operators: multiplication, addition, negation, and parity flip, and employs the Expectation Value ENcoding (EVEN) scheme to represent real numbers as quantum states. Unlike discretization or binary encoding methods, EHands operates directly on vectorized real-valued inputs prepared in the initial state and applies a shallow quantum circuit that depends only on the polynomial coefficients. The result is obtained from the expectation value measured on a single qubit, enabling efficient parallel evaluation of a polynomial across multiple data points using a single circuit. We introduce both a reversible implementation for degree-$d$ polynomials, requiring $3d$ qubits, and a non-reversible variant that uses qubit resets to reduce the requirements to $d+1$ qubits. Both implementations exhibit linear depth scaling in $d$ and are explicitly decomposed into one- and two-qubit gates for direct execution on current quantum processing units. The protocol's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental validation on IBM's Heron-class quantum processors, showing reliable polynomial approximations of functions like ReLU and arctan.</p>

            <p>Retrieving classical information from quantum systems is central to quantum information processing. As a more general task than quantum state discrimination, which focuses on identifying the exact state, quantum state exclusion only requires ruling out options, revealing fundamental limits of information extraction from quantum systems. In this work, we study the conclusive exclusion of quantum states generated by group actions, establishing explicit criteria for when such exclusion is possible. For systems with complex symmetries, including finite and compact Lie groups, we derive a sufficient condition for conclusive exclusion based on the initial state's amplitudes and the group's structure. As applications to special groups such as Abelian groups, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for conclusive state exclusion and generalize the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph result to a wider range of scenarios. Finally, we explore zero-error communication via conclusive exclusion of quantum states and derive a lower bound on the feedback-assisted and non-signalling-assisted zero-error capacity of classical-quantum channels generated by group actions.</p>

            <p>Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.</p>

            <p>Infinity is central to deriving macroscopic irreversibility from reversible microscopic laws across mathematics, theoretical computer science and physics. In analysis, infinite processes - such as Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences - construct real numbers as equivalence classes of rational approximations, bridging discrete rationals to the continuous real line. In quantum mechanics, infinite tensor products model nested measurements, where sectorization partitions the Hilbert space into equivalence classes, reconciling unitary evolution with wavefunction collapse. In statistical mechanics, macrostates emerge as equivalence classes of microstates sharing identical macroscopic properties, providing the statistical basis for thermodynamic irreversibility despite reversible dynamics. Equivalence relations formalize For-All-Practical-Purposes (FAPP) indistinguishability, reflecting operational limits on precision and observation. Together, these examples reveal a unified framework where infinity and equivalence underpin emergent macroscopic behavior from microscopic reversibility.</p>

This paper investigates the algebraic structure of a higher-dimensional analog of the QMC problem for systems of qudits. The Quantum Max d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a graph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb C^d)^{\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is identified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and a single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored hierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC problem. For a large class of complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem are derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Lastly, the paper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest eigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph Hamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian distinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d, low-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling adaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest eigenvalue in each isotypic component.</p>

            <p>Out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) are crucial tools for studying quantum chaos as they show distinct scrambling behavior for chaotic Hamiltonians. We calculate OTOC and analyze the quantum information scrambling in atom-field and spin-spin interaction models, which are open-system models and exhibit non-Markovian behavior. We also examine the Loschmidt echo for these models and comment on their chaotic nature. The commutator growth of two local operators, which is upper bounded by the Lieb-Robinson bound, is studied for these models, and the patterns of scrambling are investigated.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Floquet states facilitating coherent subharmonic response of periodically driven many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steffen Seligmann, Hamed Koochaki Kelardeh, Martin Holthaus</p>
            <p>We demonstrate longtime coherent subharmonic motion of a many-boson system subjected to an external time-periodic driving force. The underlying mechanism is exemplified numerically through analysis of a periodically driven Bose-Hubbard dimer, and clarified conceptually by semiclassical requantization of invariant tubes pertaining to the system's mean-field description. In this way, one arrives at pre-Floquet states that relate to the actual many-body Floquet states in a manner similar to the relation of site-localized Wannier states to lattice-extended Bloch states in solid-state physics. It is argued that even high-order subharmonic response can be systematically engineered, and be observed experimentally, with weakly interacting Floquet condensates comprising a sufficiently large number of particles.</p>

            <p>Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.</p>

Our approach is to map an $N$-qubit symmetric state onto a bipartite symmetric state of higher local dimension. We show that this mapping preserves separability and allows to characterize the entanglement of the original multipartite state. In particular, we establish a connection between the border rank and the Schmidt rank, and derive lower bounds on entanglement measures. Finally, we reveal the existence of entangled symmetric subspaces, where all bipartite states are entangled.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Atom in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj</p>
            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the primary methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an emitter in a doubly resonant cavity. The system is modeled by the Lindblad Master Equation, and an approximate analytical solution is derived to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. Additionally, the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits are also identified. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency is approximately $35\%$, which is several times larger than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Mandel Q parameter, revealing highly bunched two-photon emission and super-Poissonian statistics. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and its spectrum consists of three prominent peaks corresponding to transitions between the dressed states of the system.</p>

This is always the case with a continuous onsite symmetry or with a local energy conservation law. (ii) We explain a simple algorithm for a formulation of the shallow unitary circuit learning problem and relate it to an open question on strictly locality-preserving unitaries (quantum cellular automata). (iii) We show that any translation-invariant quantum cellular automaton in $D$-dimensional lattice of volume $V$ can be implemented using only $O(V)$ local gates in a staircase fashion using invertible subalgebra pumping.</p>

            <h2>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk</p>
            <p>The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.</p>

            <h2>Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Tang, Yimu Bao</p>
            <p>Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and perfect measurements and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</p>

Both the odd and even instanton sectors are summed to all orders. The double well is same-level asymmetric in the sense that the potentials at neighboring wells have the same bottom level but can have different Hessians/curvatures/frequencies, which modify Coleman's original formulas. This for instance implies that the reference model used to calculate the functional determinant of quantum fluctuations must now interpolate between simple harmonic oscillators of different frequencies. Examples of symmetric double and triple wells are worked out.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach to leverage Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. However, choosing optimal quantum circuits that efficiently solve a given VQA problem is a non-trivial task. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms enable automatic generation of quantum circuits tailored to the provided problem. Existing QAS approaches typically adapt classical neural architecture search techniques, training machine learning models to sample relevant circuits, but often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By reformulating QAS from a quantum perspective, we propose a sampling-free differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, which emerges from the search space of quantum circuits. The mixed state formulation also enables our method to incorporate generic noise models, for example the depolarizing channel, which cannot be modeled by state vector simulation. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization and Hamiltonian optimization tasks, namely the variational quantum eigensolver and the unweighted max-cut problems. We show our approach to be comparable to, if not outperform, existing QAS techniques while requiring significantly fewer quantum simulations during training, and also show improved robustness levels to noise.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermalization and average entropy of a subsystem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smitarani Mishra, Shaon Sahoo</p>
            <p>Page's seminal result on the average von Neumann (VN) entropy does not immediately apply to realistic many-body systems which are restricted to physically relevant smaller subspaces. We investigate here the VN entropy averaged over the pure states in the subspace $\mathcal{H}_E$ corresponding to a narrow energy shell centered at energy $E$. We find that the average entropy is $\overline{S}_{1} \simeq \ln d_1$, where $d_1$ represents first subsystem's effective number of states relevant to the energy scale $E$. If $d_E = \dim{(\mathcal{H}_E)}$ and $D$ ($D_1$) is the Hilbert space dimension of the full system (first subsystem), we estimate that $d_1 \simeq D_1^\gamma$, where $\gamma = \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$ for nonintegrable (chaotic) systems and $\gamma < \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$ for integrable systems. This result can be reinterpreted as a volume-law of entropy, where the volume-law coefficient depends on the density-of-states for nonintegrable systems, and remains below the maximal possible value for integrable systems. We numerically analyze a spin model to substantiate our main results.</p>

Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent control of spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium disulfide ($\beta$-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear spin density. The observed spin defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their spin dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the spin coherence time (T$_2$) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate the structure and spin densities of two possible spin defect candidates. This work will help expand the field of quantum sensing with spin defects in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>We present an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating nonlinear dynamics described by a system of stochastic dissipative differential equations with a quadratic nonlinearity. The stochastic part of the system is modeled by a Gaussian noise in the equation of motion and in the initial conditions. Our algorithm can approximate the expected value of any correlation function that depends on $O(1)$ variables with rigorous bounds on the approximation error. The runtime scales polynomially with $\log{N}$, $t$, $J$, and $\lambda_1^{-1}$, where $N$ is the total number of variables, $t$ is the evolution time, $J$ is the nonlinearity strength, and $\lambda_1$ is the smallest dissipation rate. However, the runtime scales exponentially with a parameter quantifying inverse relative error in the initial conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous quantum algorithm capable of simulating strongly nonlinear systems with $J\gg \lambda_1$ at the cost poly-logarithmic in $N$ and polynomial in $t$. The considered simulation problem is shown to be BQP-complete, providing a strong evidence for a quantum advantage. We benchmark the quantum algorithm via numerical experiments by simulating a vortex flow in the 2D Navier Stokes equation.</p>

The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at this https URL, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.</p>

            <p>We introduce a certified pruning framework that consolidates the principles of counterfactual consistency and their networked extensions into a single operational model, with consequences for both quantum foundations and cryptographic hardness. First, we formalize epsilon-counterfactual instrumentation and epsilon-stability, capturing noisy but testable constraints in laboratory contextuality experiments. Second, we extend these constraints to networks of contexts, yielding contextuality-type inequalities that apply globally across a CNF-SAT instance. Third, we implement a propagate-and-prune solver in which every learned clause is certified by a dual Farkas certificate verified in exact arithmetic. This guarantees soundness while enabling sub-exponential pruning: if the induced network provides a per-variable pruning rate rho in (0,1) under epsilon-stable propagation, the search runs in time (2-rho)^n. These bounds do not contradict ETH or SETH: the worst case remains exponential, but structured families admit provable speedups. In cryptography, the results highlight how such reductions could affect hardness margins in idealized primitives; in foundations, they motivate laboratory tests of counterfactual bounds as potential probes of computational complexity. We explicitly distinguish experimental epsilon, which quantifies laboratory visibility, from numerical epsilon, which is a solver tolerance. This builds directly on our earlier framework for epsilon-instrumentation, here integrated into certified pruning with dual certificates.</p>

            <p>Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.</p>

            <h2>Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aayush Vijayvargia, Ezra Day-Roberts, Onur Erten</p>
            <p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p>

            <h2>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Batin Tank</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Fischbach, Pierre Talbot, Pascal Bouvry</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreemayee Aditya, Alessandro Summer, Piotr Sierant, Xhek Turkeshi</p>
            <p>The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate efficient interfacing of a large number of atoms to an optical nanofiber using an optical lattice with tunable spacing ($0.88-1.5~\mu$m) projected onto the nanofiber. The lattice beam and reflections from the nanofiber yield trap potentials that provide tight confinement in all motional degrees of freedom $\approx 220$ nm above the nanofiber surface, enabling efficient atom-photon coupling. We achieve trapping of $\approx1300$ atoms in periodic trap sites with a trap lifetime of $\approx15$ ms. We also observe the effect of varied lattice periods on the atomic motional frequencies. Our new scheme is adaptable to other nanophotonic cold-atom systems and provides a versatile and scalable platform for studying photon-mediated long-range collective interactions.</p>

            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyi Li, Yu Gan, Zeguan Wu, Xueyue Zhang, Zheshen Zhang, Junyu Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates (e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By applying König's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero $T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck, eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive tasks on emerging quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher information matrices from Rényi relative entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the Rényi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric Rényi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean Rényi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric Rényi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ Rényi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</p>

An increase of the Gibbs-Shannon-von Neumann entropy results without the usual coarse-graining.

            <h2>Quantum steering for different types of Bell-like states in gravitational background</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Han Li, Si-Han Shang, Shu-Min Wu</p>
            <p>In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</p>

            <h2>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet states in laser-dressed crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Tiwari, Roman Korol, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</p>

            <h2>QuIC: Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snehal Raj, Brian Coyle</p>
            <p>Scaling full finetuning of large foundation models strains GPU memory and training time. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue via adapter modules which update only a small subset of model parameters. In this work, we introduce Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters (QuIC Adapters), a PEFT approach inspired from Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits that can effectively finetune a model using less than 0.02\% memory footprint of the base model. QuIC adapters preserve pretrained representations by enforcing orthogonality in weight parameters, and have native deployment mechanisms on quantum computers. We test QuIC adapters by finetuning large language models like LLaMA and vision transformers on language, math, reasoning and vision benchmarks. In its first-order configuration, QuIC recovers the performance of existing orthogonal methods, while higher-order configurations enable substantial parameter compression (over 40x smaller than LoRA) for a modest performance trade-off, unlocking applications in highly resource-constrained environments. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant finetuning. Our findings suggest that QuIC adapters offers a promising direction for efficient finetuning of foundation models in resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</p>

            <p>Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) are at the forefront of precision metrology, operating near a standard quantum limit (SQL) set by quantum noise. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit, yet there remain practical roadblocks concerning scalability and measurement resolution requirements. Here, we adapt the holonomic quantum-gate concept to develop a novel Rabi-type "global-phase spectroscopy" (GPS) that utilizes the detuning-sensitive global Aharanov-Anandan phase. With this approach, we are able to demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy in an OLC that achieves 2.4(7) dB metrological gain without subtracting the laser noise, and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the SQL. We further introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light-atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-canceling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily owing to the global nature of entangling interaction, and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikolaj Roguski, Aleksandr Shlykov, Ziv Meir, Stefan Willitsch</p>
            <p>Quantum-logic spectroscopy has become an increasingly important tool for the state detection and readout of trapped atomic and molecular ions which do not possess easily accessible closed-cycling optical transitions. In this approach, the internal state of the target ion is mapped onto a co-trapped auxiliary ion. This mapping is typically mediated by normal modes of motion of the two-ion Coulomb crystal in the trap. The present study investigates the role of spectator modes not directly involved in a measurement protocol relying on a state-dependent optical-dipole force. We identify a Debye-Waller-type effect that modifies the response of the two-ion string to the force. We show that cooling the spectator modes of the string allows for the detection of the rovibrational ground state of an N$_2^+$ molecular ion with a computed statistical fidelity exceeding 99.99%, improving on previous experiments by more than an order of magnitude while also halving the experimental time. This enhanced sensitivity enables the simultaneous identification of multiple rotational states with markedly weaker signals.</p>

            <p>Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</p>

            <p>We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent curved space gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. The lensing effect can appear in systems without (emergent) magnetic fields, such as those with coplanar spin textures. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.</p>
