            <h2>QDCNN: Quantum Deep Learning for Enhancing Safety and Reliability in Autonomous Transportation Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashtakala Meghanath, Subham Das, Bikash K.Behera, Muhammad Attique Khan, Saif Al-Kuwari, Ahmed Farouk</p>
            <p>In transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring safety and reliability in real-time decision-making is essential for successfully deploying autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation networks. However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU† method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate the key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.</p>

            <h2>QCS-ADME: Quantum Circuit Search for Drug Property Prediction with Imbalanced Data and Regression Adaptation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kangyu Zheng, Tianfan Fu, Zhiding Liang</p>
            <p>The biomedical field is beginning to explore the use of quantum machine learning (QML) for tasks traditionally handled by classical machine learning, especially in predicting ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties, which are essential in drug evaluation. However, ADME tasks pose unique challenges for existing quantum computing systems (QCS) frameworks, as they involve both classification with unbalanced dataset and regression problems. These dual requirements make it necessary to adapt and refine current QCS frameworks to effectively address the complexities of ADME predictions. We propose a novel training-free scoring mechanism to evaluate QML circuit performance on imbalanced classification and regression tasks. Our mechanism demonstrates significant correlation between scoring metrics and test performance on imbalanced classification tasks. Additionally, we develop methods to quantify continuous similarity relationships between quantum states, enabling performance prediction for regression tasks. This represents the first comprehensive approach to searching and evaluating QCS circuits specifically for regression applications. Validation on representative ADME tasks-one imbalanced classification and one regression-demonstrates moderate positive correlation between our scoring metrics and circuit performance, significantly outperforming baseline scoring methods that show negligible correlation.</p>

            <h2>Universal Counterdiabatic Driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stewart Morawetz, Anatoli Polkovnikov</p>
            <p>Local counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a systematic way of constructing a control protocol to approximately suppress the excitations resulting from changing some parameter(s) of a quantum system at a finite rate. However, designing CD protocols typically requires knowledge of the original Hamiltonian a priori. In this work, we design local CD driving protocols in Krylov space using only the characteristic local time scales of the system set by e.g. phonon frequencies in materials or Rabi frequencies in superconducting qubit arrays. Surprisingly, we find that convergence of these universal protocols is controlled by the asymptotic high frequency tails of the response functions. This finding hints at a deep connection between the long-time, low frequency response of the system controlling non-adiabatic effects, and the high-frequency response determined by the short-time operator growth and the Krylov complexity, which has been elusive until now.</p>

            <h2>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jernej Rudi Finzgar, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin Mikhail, Dries Sels</p>
            <p>Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced quantum frequency estimation by nonlinear scrambling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor Montenegro, Sara Dornetti, Alessandro Ferraro, Matteo G. A. Paris</p>
            <p>Frequency estimation, a cornerstone of basic and applied sciences, has been significantly enhanced by quantum sensing strategies. Despite breakthroughs in quantum-enhanced frequency estimation, key challenges remain: static probes limit flexibility, and the interplay between resource efficiency, sensing precision, and potential enhancements from nonlinear probes remains not fully understood. In this work, we show that dynamically encoding an unknown frequency in a nonlinear quantum electromagnetic field can significantly improve frequency estimation. To provide a fair comparison of resources, we define the energy cost as the figure of merit for our sensing strategy. We further show that specific higher-order nonlinear processes lead to nonlinear-enhanced frequency estimation. This enhancement results from quantum scrambling, where local quantum information spreads across a larger portion of the Hilbert space. We quantify this effect using the Wigner-Yanase skew information, which measures the degree of noncommutativity in the Hamiltonian structure. Our work sheds light on the connection between Wigner-Yanase skew information and quantum sensing, providing a direct method to optimize nonlinear quantum probes.</p>

            <h2>Towards Heisenberg limit without critical slowing down via quantum reinforcement learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Xu, Tailong Xiao, Jingzheng Huang, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Guihua Zeng</p>
            <p>Critical ground states of quantum many-body systems have emerged as vital resources for quantum-enhanced sensing. Traditional methods to prepare these states often rely on adiabatic evolution, which may diminish the quantum sensing advantage. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL)-enhanced critical sensing protocol for quantum many-body systems with exotic phase diagrams. Starting from product states and utilizing QRL-discovered gate sequences, we explore sensing accuracy in the presence of unknown external magnetic fields, covering both local and global regimes. Our results demonstrate that QRL-learned sequences reach the finite quantum speed limit and generalize effectively across systems of arbitrary size, ensuring accuracy regardless of preparation time. This method can robustly achieve Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg limits, even in noisy environments with practical Pauli measurements. Our study highlights the efficacy of QRL in enabling precise quantum state preparation, thereby advancing scalable, high-accuracy quantum critical sensing.</p>

            <h2>Variety of Superradiant Phase Transition in Bose-Fermi System with Tight-Binding Model in the weak-coupling regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Su, Jian-Jian Cheng, Lin Zhang</p>
            <p>We present a full exploration of the dynamic diversity inherent in superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intricately coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing a quantized electromagnetic vector potential via the Peierls substitution, this gauge-coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions. These transitions are characterized by the displacement of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum, thereby circumventing the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, the single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and varied spontaneous symmetry breaking. This configuration enables the precise manipulation of superradiant phases in weak coupling regimes, devoid of the quantum fluctuation divergence. Our findings advance the understanding of tunable quantum devices and highlight potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum memristor with vacuum--one-photon qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Di Micco, Beatrice Polacchi, Taira Giordani, Fabio Sciarrino</p>
            <p>Quantum memristors represent a promising interface between quantum and neuromorphic computing, combining the nonlinear, memory-dependent behavior of classical memristors with the properties of quantum states. An optical quantum memristor can be realized with a vacuum--one-photon qubit entering a tunable beam splitter whose reflectivity is adapted according to the mean number of photons in the device. In this work, we report on the experimental implementation of a bulk quantum-optical memristor, working with single-rail coherent superposition states in the Fock basis, generated via a resonantly excited quantum dot single-photon source. We demonstrate that the coherence of the input state is preserved by the quantum memristor. Moreover, our modular platform allows investigating the nonlinear behavior arising from a cascade of two quantum memristors, a building block for larger networks of such devices towards the realization of complex neuromorphic quantum architectures.</p>

            <h2>Generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs from two interacting quantum emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrián Juan-Delgado, Geza Giedke, Javier Aizpurua, Ruben Esteban</p>
            <p>Entangled photon pairs are key elements in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. State-of-the-art sources of entangled photons are mainly based on parametric-down conversion from nonlinear crystals, which is probabilistic in nature, and on cascade emission from biexciton quantum dots, which finds difficulties in generating entangled photons in the visible regime. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that polarization-entangled photon pairs can be emitted from two interacting quantum emitters with two-level-system behaviour and perpendicular transition dipole moments. These emitters can represent a large variety of systems (e.g., organic molecules, quantum dots and diamond-color centers) offering a large technological versatility, for example in the spectral regime of the emission. We show that a highly entangled photon pair can be post-selected from this system by including optical filters. Additionally, we verify that the photon entanglement is not significantly affected by small changes in the detection directions and in the orientation between the dipole moments.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Quantum Chemistry Calculations on Noisy Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nora Bauer, Kübra Yeter-Aydeniz, George Siopsis</p>
            <p>We present a hardware-efficient optimization scheme for quantum chemistry calculations, utilizing the Sampled Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) method. Our algorithm, optimized SQD (SQDOpt), combines the classical Davidson method technique with added multi-basis measurements to optimize a quantum Ansatz on hardware using a fixed number of measurements per optimization step. This addresses the key challenge associated with other quantum chemistry optimization protocols, namely Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which must measure in hundreds to thousands of bases to estimate energy on hardware, even for molecules with less than 20 qubits. Numerical results for various molecules, including hydrogen chains, water, and methane, demonstrate the efficacy of our method compared to classical and quantum variational approaches, and we confirm the performance on the IBM-Cleveland quantum hardware, where we find instances where SQDOpt either matches or exceeds the solution quality of noiseless VQE. A runtime scaling indicates that SQDOpt on quantum hardware is competitive with classical state-of-the-art methods, with a crossover point of 1.5 seconds/iteration for the SQDOpt on quantum hardware and classically simulated VQE with the 20-qubit H$_{12}$ molecule. Our findings suggest that the proposed SQDOpt framework offers a scalable and robust pathway for quantum chemistry simulations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.</p>

            <p>Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behaviour of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200ns for such a qubit. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.</p>

            <h2>Melting of devil's staircases in the long-range Dicke-Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Alexander Koziol, Anja Langheld, Kai Phillip Schmidt</p>
            <p>We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.</p>

            <h2>Diverging entanglement of critical magnons in easy-axis antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jongjun M. Lee, Hyun-Woo Lee, Myung-Joong Hwang</p>
            <p>We study the instability of antiferromagnets with easy-axis anisotropy under a magnetic field, uncovering single or even multiple phase transitions at the boundary between non-collinear and collinear spin orderings. Near the phase boundary, the entanglement between the sublattice magnons diverges due to the interplay among antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, anisotropy, and magnetic field. Furthermore, our study reveals that this magnetic criticality extends to a superradiant phase transition within cavity magnonics systems. The magnon-photon interaction results in diverging cavity photon numbers and squeezing in the ground state at the transition points between spin orderings. This investigation not only elucidates the criticality of multi-component squeezed magnons in antiferromagnets, but also proposes cavity photon measurements as a viable method for detecting magnetic phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Fanucchi, G. Forghieri, A. Secchi, P. Bordone, F. Troiani</p>
            <p>Holes in Si quantum dots are being investigated for the implementation of electrically addressable spin qubits. In this perspective, the attention has been focused on the electric-field induced transitions between the eigenstates belonging to the ground doublet. Here we theoretically extend the analysis to the first excited doublet. We show that - in a prototypical quantum dot structure - transitions involving the lowest excited states display Rabi frequencies that are several orders of magnitude larger than those occurring in the ground doublet. A clear relation with the symmetries of the eigenstates emerges, as well as a wide tunability of the Rabi frequencies by means of the applied bias. A preliminary discussion on the possible implications of the present results for multilevel manipulation schemes and for multi-hole qubit encodings is provided.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational entanglement witness through Einstein ring image</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youka Kaku, Yasusada Nambu</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between quantum theory and gravity by exploring gravitational lensing and Einstein ring images in a weak gravitational field induced by a mass source in spatial quantum superposition. We analyze a quantum massless scalar field propagating in two distinct models of gravity: the first quantized Newtonian gravity (QG) model, which generates quantum entanglement between the mass source and other systems, and the Schrödinger-Newton (SN) gravity model, which does not produce entanglement. Visualizing the two-point correlation function of the scalar field, we find that the QG model produces a composition of multiple Einstein rings, reflecting the spatial superposition of the mass source. By contrast, the SN model yields a single deformed ring image, representing a classical spacetime configuration. Furthermore, we introduce a specific quantity named the which-path information indicator and visualize its image. The QG model again reveals multiple Einstein rings, while the image intensity in the SN model notably vanishes. Our findings provide a visual approach to witness gravity-induced entanglement through distinct features in Einstein ring images. This study advances our understanding of quantum effects in general relativistic contexts and establishes a foundation for future studies of other relativistic phenomena.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Ratio</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenichi Konishi, Hans-Thomas Elze</p>
            <p>The concept of the Quantum Ratio was born out of the efforts to find a simple but universal criterion if the center of mass (CM) of an isolated (microscopic or macroscopic) body behaves quantum mechanically or classically, and under which conditions. It is defined as the ratio between the quantum fluctuation range, which is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, and the linear size of the body (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases where the ratio is smaller than unity or much larger than unity, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. An important notion following from the introduction of quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical. This is so even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence (mixed state) and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation is further elaborated, by analyzing some atomic or molecular processes. It may have far-reaching implications on the way quantum mechanics works, e.g., in biological systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Goksu Can Toga, Abhishek Samlodia, Alexander F. Kemper</p>
            <p>We investigate many-body chaos and scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising model, a mixed-field Ising model living in the background of AdS2. The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arman Sauliere, Beatrice Magni, Guglielmo Lami, Xhek Turkeshi, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We establish universal behavior in the anticoncentration properties of random quantum circuits, demonstrating its broad independence from the circuit architecture. Specifically, universality emerges in a certain scaling limit and extends beyond the leading order, incorporating subleading corrections arising from the finite system size $N$. We compute these corrections through exact calculations on ensembles of random tensor network states and corroborate the results with analytical findings in the random phase model. We then identify a heuristic framework for generic brickwork circuits, conjecturing the universality of these corrections. We further support our claim of anticoncentration universality through extensive numerical simulations, capturing the distribution of overlaps for systems up to $N = 64$ qudits and computing collision probabilities for systems up to $N \leq 1024$. Collectively, our results highlight the critical role of finite-size corrections and lead to a thorough understanding of the core phenomenology governing anticoncentration in quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Quantum illumination via frequency-mode-based correlation-to-displacement conversion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Zhibin Ye</p>
            <p>Quantum illumination leverages entanglement to surpass classical target detection, even in high-noise environments. Remarkably, its quantum advantage persists despite entanglement degradation caused by environmental decoherence. A central challenge lies in designing optimal receivers to exploit this advantage, with the correlation-to-displacement conversion module emerging as a promising candidate. However, the practical implementation of the conversion module faces technical hurdles, primarily due to the vast number of modes involved. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a frequency-mode entangled source with matched photon numbers, a heterodyne detection scheme for the returned signals across vast modes, and a cavity-enhanced quantum pulse gate for programmable mode processing. This integrated framework paves the way for the realization of practical quantum illumination systems.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimisation of Traveling Salesperson Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christos Lytrosyngounis, Ioannis Lytrosyngounis</p>
            <p>The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimisation challenge with widespread applications in logistics, operations research, and network design. While classical algorithms effectively solve small to medium-sized instances, they struggle with scalability due to exponential complexity. In this work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages IBM's Qiskit Runtime to integrate quantum optimisation techniques with classical machine learning methods, specifically K-Means clustering and Random Forest classifiers. These machine learning components aid in problem decomposition and noise mitigation, improving the quality of quantum solutions. Experimental results for TSP instances ranging from 4 to 8 cities reveal that the quantum-only approach produces solutions up to 21.7% worse than the classical baseline, while the hybrid method reduces this cost increase to 11.3% for 8 cities. This demonstrates that hybrid approaches improve solution quality compared to purely quantum methods but remain suboptimal compared to classical solvers. Despite current hardware limitations, these results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced methods for combinatorial optimisation, paving the way for future advancements in scalable quantum computing frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Variational Quantum Algorithm with Many-qubit for Optimization Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seongmin Kim, In-Saeng Suh</p>
            <p>Optimization problems are critical across various domains, yet existing quantum algorithms, despite their great potential, struggle with scalability and accuracy due to excessive reliance on entanglement. To address these limitations, we propose variational quantum optimization algorithm (VQOA), which leverages many-qubit (MQ) operations in an ansatz solely employing quantum superposition, completely avoiding entanglement. This ansatz significantly reduces circuit complexity, enhances noise robustness, mitigates Barren Plateau issues, and enables efficient partitioning for highly complex large-scale optimization. Furthermore, we introduce distributed VQOA (DVQOA), which integrates high-performance computing with quantum computing to achieve superior performance across MQ systems and classical nodes. These features enable a significant acceleration of material optimization tasks (e.g., metamaterial design), achieving more than 50$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Additionally, DVQOA efficiently solves quantum chemistry problems and $\textit{N}$-ary $(N \geq 2)$ optimization problems involving higher-order interactions. These advantages establish DVQOA as a highly promising and versatile solver for real-world problems, demonstrating the practical utility of the quantum-classical approach.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement dynamics via Geometric phases in Trapped-ions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dharmaraj Ramachandran, Ganesh H, Radhika Vathsan</p>
            <p>Trapped-ion systems are a leading platform for quantum computing. The Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate is a widely used method for implementing controlled interactions in multipartite systems. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the environment, quantum states undergo non-unitary evolution, leading to significant deviations from ideal dynamics. Common techniques such as Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) and Bell State Tomography (BST) are typically employed to evaluate MS gate performance and to characterize noise in the system. In this letter, we propose leveraging the geometric phase as a tool for performance assessment and noise identification in the MS gate. Our findings indicate that the geometric phase is particularly sensitive to environmental noise occurring around twice the clock pulse time. Given that geometric phase measurements do not require full-state tomography, this approach offers a practical and experimentally feasible method to detect entanglement and classify the nature of noise affecting the system.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Variational Quantum Regressor for Enhancing QSPR Modeling of CO2-Capturing Amine</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyein Cho, Jeonghoon Kim, Hocheol Lim</p>
            <p>Accurate amine property prediction is essential for optimizing CO2 capture efficiency in post-combustion processes. Quantum machine learning (QML) can enhance predictive modeling by leveraging superposition, entanglement, and interference to capture complex correlations. In this study, we developed hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNN) to improve quantitative structure-property relationship modeling for CO2-capturing amines. By integrating variational quantum regressors with classical multi-layer perceptrons and graph neural networks, quantum advantages were explored in physicochemical property prediction under noiseless conditions and robustness was evaluated against quantum hardware noise using IBM quantum systems. Our results showed that HQNNs improve predictive accuracy for key solvent properties, including basicity, viscosity, boiling point, melting point, and vapor pressure. The fine-tuned and frozen pre-trained HQNN models with 9 qubits consistently achieved the highest rankings, highlighting the benefits of integrating quantum layers with pre-trained classical models. Furthermore, simulations under hardware noise confirmed the robustness of HQNNs, maintaining predictive performance. Overall, these findings emphasize the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in molecular modeling. As quantum hardware and QML algorithms continue to advance, practical quantum benefits in QSPR modeling and materials discovery are expected to become increasingly attainable, driven by improvements in quantum circuit design, noise mitigation, and scalable architectures.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic high-rate entanglement distillation with neutral atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas A. Hahn, Ryan White, Hannes Bernien, Rotem Arnon-Friedman</p>
            <p>The goal of an entanglement distillation protocol is to convert large quantities of noisy entangled states into a smaller number of high-fidelity Bell pairs. The celebrated one-way hashing method is one such protocol, and it is known for being able to efficiently and deterministically distill entanglement in the asymptotic limit, i.e., when the size of the quantum system is very large. In this work, we consider setups with finite resources, e.g., a small fixed number of atoms in an atom array, and derive lower bounds on the distillation rate for the one-way hashing method. We provide analytical as well as numerical bounds on its entanglement distillation rate -- both significantly tighter than previously known bounds. We then show how the one-way hashing method can be efficiently implemented with neutral atom arrays. The combination of our theoretical results and the experimental blueprint we provide indicate that a full coherent implementation of the one-way hashing method is within reach with state-of-the-art quantum technology.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Lamb model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis P. Clougherty, Nam H. Dinh</p>
            <p>H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We show that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and we find that it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory for coupling strength below a critical value. The model is found to break down for coupling strength above the critical value where the lowest Bogoliubov frequency vanishes. We show that the addition of an anharmonic elastic term is sufficient to stabilize the system in this strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Torino device for qubits and AQT device for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.</p>

            <p>Levitated systems have great potential in quantum sensing and exploring quantum effects at the macroscopic scale. Of particular interest are recent works suggesting that a levitated ferromagnet can beat the standard quantum limit of magnetometry. This work offers a theoretical model to analyze and understand critical features of the precessing dynamics of a levitated ferromagnetic needle, indeed much like a macrospin, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. The dynamics from the atomic scale reveals how the standard quantum limit is surpassed, thus verifying sensing advantages when compared with a collection of independent spins. Our theory further takes us to two additional experimental designs of immediate interest: measurement of the celebrated Berry phase with a precessing ferromagnetic needle and the use of its nutation motion to sense a low-frequency oscillating magnetic field. With a microscopic theory established for levitated ferromagnetic needles, future studies of macroscopic quantum effects and the associated quantum-classical transition also become possible.</p>

            <p>The incompatibility between quantum measurements is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics with profound implications for uncertainty relations and quantum information processing. In this paper, we realized that the $s$-order incompatibility of measurements by Xu (inspired by De Bièvre's "complete incompatibility" ), can be equivalently characterized by spark of the associated measurement matrix. This provides a new linear algebraic perspective on measurement incompatibility. Leveraging this insight, we extend $s$-order incompatibility to rank-one POVMs and establish novel uncertainty relations. Furthermore, we explore the incompatibility of multiple bases and its connection to support uncertainty relations. These results may have applications in quantum cryptography, quantum state reconstruction, and quantum compressed sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Sun, Geng-Bin Cao, Xi-Dan Hu, Dan-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum operator scrambling describes the spreading of local operators into the whole system in the picture of Heisenberg evolution, which is often quantified by the operator size growth. Here we propose a measure of quantum operator scrambling via Holevo information of operators, by taking its capacity to distinguish operator information locally. We show that the operator size is closely related to a special kind of Holevo information of operators. Moreover, we propose a feasible protocol for measuring Holevo information of operators on digital quantum simulators based on random states. Our numerical simulations show that the integrable system can be told apart from the chaotic system by measuring the spatial-temporal patterns of Holevo information. Furthermore, we find that error mitigation is required to restore the time-oscillation behavior of Holevo information for the integrable system, a crucial feature distinct from the chaotic one. Our work provides a new perspective to understand the information scrambling and quantum chaos from aspects of Holevo information of operators.</p>

            <h2>Nonadiabatic braiding of Majorana modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Yu, P. Z. Zhao, Jiangbin Gong</p>
            <p>The realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes have drawn significant attention for their crucial role in enabling topological quantum computation. Conventional approaches to the braiding of Majorana zero modes rely on adiabatic processes. In this work, using a composite 2-Kitaev-chain system accommodating Majorana zero modes as a working example, we propose a nonadiabatic and non-Abelian geometry phase-based protocol to execute operations on these Majorana zero modes. This is possible by locally coupling the edge sites of both quantum chains with an embedded lattice defect, successfully simulating the braiding operation of two Majorana modes in a highly nonadiabatic fashion. To further enhance the robustness against control imperfections, we apply a multiple-pulse composite strategy to our quantum chain setting for second-order protection of the braiding operations. Our proposal can also support the fast and robust realization of the {\pi}/8 gate, an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. This work hence offers a potential pathway towards the nonadiabatic and fault-tolerant control of Majorana zero modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shishir Khandelwal, Armin Tavakoli</p>
            <p>Quantum instruments describe both the classical outcome and the updated state associated with a quantum measurement. We ask whether these processes can be simulated using only a natural subset of resources, namely projective measurements on the system and quantum processing of the post-measurement states. We show that the simulability of instruments can be connected to an entanglement classification problem. This leads to a computationally efficient necessary condition for simulation of generic instruments and to a complete characterisation for qubits. We use this to address relevant quantum information tasks, namely (i) the noise-tolerance of standard qubit unsharp measurements, (ii) non-projective advantages in information-disturbance trade-offs, and (iii) increased sequential Bell inequality violations under projective measurements. Moreover, we consider also $d$-dimensional Lüders instruments that correspond to weak versions of standard basis measurements and show that for large $d$ these can permit scalable noise-advantages over projective implementations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum nonlocal double slit interference with partially coherent qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sakshi Rao, Bhaskar Kanseri</p>
            <p>Partially coherent quantum-entangled beams combine quantum entanglement with partial coherence, allowing them to maintain quantum characteristics while being more resistant to distortions caused by random media during propagation. In this study, we investigate the effect of coherence variation of such beams on non-local double-slit quantum interference. The spatial coherence variation is achieved by controlling the spot size and transverse coherence length of the Gaussian Schell model pump in the spontaneous parametric down conversion process. For a fixed beam size, the momentum correlation width of partially coherent biphotons increases with the decreases in the transverse coherence length. This results in a biphoton beam exhibiting multiple spatial modes, making it more suitable for studying the non-local features of quantum states in imaging, interference, and diffraction experiments. Our findings infer both high-quality and near-unity visibility of nonlocal interference using the partially coherent twin beams, even with the substantial decrease in the coherence of the pump. We believe these results can enhance robustness against the deleterious effects of the medium during propagation and can have potential applications in optical image cryptography, biomedical imaging, quantum lithography, and quantum holography.</p>

            <p>The ability to control light-matter interfaces with solid-state photon emitters is a major requirement for the development of quantum photonic integrated circuits. We demonstrate controllable coupling between a quantum dot and an optical mode in a dielectric waveguide using a nano-opto-electro-mechanical phase shifter and a photonic crystal mirror. By controlling the phase, we induce a virtual displacement of the mirror that modifies the local density of states at the position of the emitter, thereby enhancing or suppressing spontaneous emission without an optical cavity. We observe a broadband tuning of the spontaneous emission rate and a modulation of the intensity emitted by the quantum dot in the waveguide. The method reported here could be employed to optimize the emitter-field interaction between quantum dots in-operando, by maximizing a single-photon source generation rate or adjusting its lifetime, as well as a characterization tool for the direct measurement of emitter-photon cooperativity.</p>

            <p>Quantum memory plays a pivotal role in the construction of quantum repeaters, which are essential devices for establishing long-distance quantum communications and large-scale quantum networks. To boost information capacity and signal processing speed, the implementation of high-efficiency multiplexed quantum memories is essential for the development of multiplexed quantum repeaters. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient multiplexed quantum memory by consolidating photons carrying high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) state from 4 individual channels into an elongated cold $^{87}$Rb atomic ensemble. Benefiting from the cold atomic ensemble with high optical depth, we obtain a storage efficiency exceeding 70% for the 4-channel multiplexed beam. The storage fidelities surpass 83% when all channels are operated in a 4-dimensional Hilbert space, which is far above the classical benchmark and validates the quantum functionality of our memory system. The achieved high-efficiency OAM multiplexed quantum memory opens up an avenue for efficient quantum information processing over multiple parallel channels, promising significant advances in the field of quantum communication and networking.</p>

            <p>Quantum communication at microwave frequencies has been fundamentally constrained by the susceptibility of microwave photons to thermal noise, hindering their application in scalable quantum networks. Here we demonstrate a thermal-noise-resilient microwave quantum network that establishes coherent coupling between two superconducting qubits through a 4 K thermalized niobium-titanium transmission line. By overcoupling the communication channel to a cold load at 10 mK, we suppress the effective thermal occupancy of the channel to 0.06 photons through radiative cooling -- a two-order-of-magnitude reduction below ambient thermal noise. We then decouple the cold load and rapidly transfer microwave quantum states through the channel while it rethermalizes, achieving a 58.5% state transfer fidelity and a 52.3% Bell entanglement fidelity, both exceeding the classical communication threshold. Our architecture overcomes the temperature-compatibility barrier for microwave quantum systems, providing a scalable framework for distributed quantum computing and enabling hybrid quantum networks with higher-temperature semiconductor or photonic platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum memories based on emitters with optically addressable spins rely on efficient photonic interfaces, often implemented as nanophotonic cavities with ideally narrow spectral linewidths and small mode volumes. However, these approaches require nearly perfect spectral and spatial overlap between the cavity mode and quantum emitter, which can be challenging. This is especially true in the case of solid-state quantum emitters that are often randomly positioned and can suffer from significant inhomogeneous broadening. An alternative approach to mitigate these challenges is to use slow-light waveguides that can enhance light-matter interaction across large optical bandwidths and large areas. Here, we demonstrate diamond slow light photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides that enable broadband optical coupling to embedded silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers. We take advantage of the recently demonstrated thin-film diamond photonic platform to fabricate fully suspended two-dimensional PhC waveguides. Using this approach, we demonstrate waveguide modes with high group indices up to 70 and observe Purcell-enhanced emissions of the SiVs coupled to the waveguide mode. Our approach represents a practical diamond platform for robust spin-photon interfaces with color centers.</p>

            <h2>Magic State Distillation under Imperfect Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunzhe Zheng, Yuanchen Zhao, Dong E. Liu</p>
            <p>We examine the impact of imperfect measurement on magic state distillation (MSD) process by employing the framework of stabilizer reduction, which characterizes MSD protocols using stabilizer codes. We show the existence of thresholds for measurement strength in MSD protocols, below which there doesn't exist non-trivial target states and no input states can be distilled into better states. We prove that for MSD protocols based on CSS codes with transversal non-Clifford gates, the first-order effect of imperfect measurement will at most cause biased Pauli noise on the target states. Furthermore, we prove that we can minimize the effect of imperfect measurement noise on the asymptotically distilled states by measuring stabilizer generators in the standard form. We numerically demonstrate our theoretical results by simulating the $[[15, 1, 3]]$ and $[[14, 2, 2]]$ MSD protocols using the mapping from MSD protocols to dynamical systems. Our numerical results imply that the existence of imperfect measurement degrades the order of convergence rate to linear, regardless of the original order in the noiseless case. Our work will therefore contribute to understanding fault-tolerant quantum computing under imperfect measurement noise.</p>

            <h2>Noise effects on the diagnostics of quantum chaos</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingfei Li</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the effects of noise on the diagnostics of quantum chaos, focusing on three primary tools: the spectral form factor (SFF), Krylov complexity, and out-of-time correlators (OTOCs). Utilizing a closed quantum system model with white noise, we demonstrate that increasing noise strength leads to an exponential suppression of these diagnostic measures. Specifically, our findings reveal that in the strong noise limit, the SFF, two-point correlation function, and OTOCs become ineffective in distinguishing chaotic behavior. The SFF is particularly impacted, exhibiting a significant decay that obscures its ability to identify quantum chaos. This study highlights the challenges posed by environmental noise in accurately diagnosing quantum chaotic systems and suggests that traditional methods may require adaptation to remain effective in realistic open quantum systems. Our results underscore the need for further research into robust diagnostic techniques that can account for noise-induced effects in quantum chaotic systems.</p>

            <p>The Meissner effect, a signature feature of superconductors, involves circular surface currents that cancel an external field. In this study, we present our findings on Meissner-like currents of photons in highly tunable light-matter interaction systems. In a quantum Rabi zigzag chain exposed to a staggered magnetic field, we identify a Meissner superradiant phase, manifesting persistent chiral edge currents in the ground state. Counter-flowing edge currents arise in each species of cavities,leading to complete cancellation of net currents throughout the entire chain. This phenomenon is analogous to surface currents in the Meissner effect. The Meissner phase is signaled by the unusual scaling exponents of the lowest excitation energy, which exhibit anomalous criticality with and without geometric frustration in each species. Intriguingly, adjusting the staggered flux induces transitions from the Meissner phase to either the even-chiral or odd-chiral superradiant phases, where the chiral edge currents flow exclusively in even or odd cavities, respectively. Additionally, by enhancing interspecies interactions, chiral currents vanish in a ferromagnetic superradiant phase. Our realization of Meissner-like currents of photons opens avenues for exploring edge state interferometry and quantum Hall effects within light-matter coupling platforms.</p>

            <p>The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a cornerstone in the study of light-matter interactions within cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). It effectively captures the dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a single-mode resonator, serving as a foundation for understanding quantum optical phenomena in a great variety of systems. However, this model may produce inaccurate results for large coupling strengths, even in systems with high anharmonicity. Moreover, issues of gauge invariance further undermine its reliability. In this work, we introduce a renormalized QRM that incorporates the effective influence of higher atomic energy levels, providing a significantly more accurate representation of the system while still maintaining a two-level description. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we present two different examples: an atom in a double-well potential and a superconducting artificial atom (fluxonium qubit). This procedure opens new possibilities for precisely engineering and understanding cavity and circuit QED systems, which are highly sought-after, especially for quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Cavities have driven significant advances in optical physics and quantum science, with applications ranging from lasers and spectroscopy to quantum information processing, simulation and metrology. For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-Pérot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $>$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.</p>

First, we describe various first order topological insulator phases and their characterizations while explaining various anomalous quantum Hall effects and quantum spin Hall effects in the extended Haldane model. Second, we demonstrate the concepts of higher order topological insulator phases along with the topological invariants in the anisotropic limit of the extended Haldane model.

            <p>Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</p>

            <p>We consider quantum field theoretic many-body Green's function approach to solve the Coulomb many-body problem. The earlier beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories are absolute in nature and are based on the non-reduced Hamiltonian. Motivated by the issues following this approach we have developed a reduced Green's function theory which is relational in nature. The central differences between these approaches trace back to the relational-absolute debate, which has continued for over two thousand years since the time of Aristotle and still persists today. We highlight that these aspects of the theories are connected to several areas of modern physics, including relational quantum mechanics, quantum reference frames, superselection rules, the separation of different types of motion and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The starting point of any such exact theory must be absolute, given that the global conservation laws hold. However, for the observables to be meaningful, they must be defined with respect to the relative space. Approximations, such as the one introduced by Born and Oppenheimer, can break global symmetries and make certain parts of the absolute description well-defined. We highlight that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not necessary to explain the existence of solids, but entities such as phonons can be naturally explained within the relational theory.</p>

The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution.

This continuous scale invariance starts to dominate the behavior of the system at the dimension $\overline{D}<D_c$, below which the trimers momentum distribution tails exhibit a power-law behavior signaling the unatomic regime. To illustrate our findings, we studied compounds of the forms $^{7}$Li$-^{23}$Na$_{2}$, $^{7}$Li$-^{87}$Rb$_{2}$ and $^{7}$Li$-^{133}$Cs$_{2}$. The increase in the mass-imbalance of the trimers reduces the interval between $D_c$ and $\overline{D}$. The emergence of unatomic states can be experimentally verified by observing the two-body contact parameter, which is a quantity directly related to the thermodynamic properties of the gas.</p>

            <h2>Unconditionally stable time discretization of Lindblad master equations in infinite dimension using quantum channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rémi Robin, Pierre Rouchon, Lev-Arcady Sellem</p>
            <p>We examine the time discretization of Lindblad master equations in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our study is motivated by the fact that, with unbounded Lindbladian, projecting the evolution onto a finite-dimensional subspace using a Galerkin approximation inherently introduces stiffness, leading to a Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy type condition for explicit integration schemes. We propose and establish the convergence of a family of explicit numerical schemes for time discretization adapted to infinite dimension. These schemes correspond to quantum channels and thus preserve the physical properties of quantum evolutions on the set of density operators: linearity, complete positivity and trace. Numerical experiments inspired by bosonic quantum codes illustrate the practical interest of this approach when approximating the solution of infinite dimensional problems by that of finite dimensional problems of increasing dimension.</p>

            <h2>Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin D. Woods</p>
            <p>The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</p>

            <h2>A projected complex Langevin sampling method for bosons in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan C. McGarrigle, Hector D. Ceniceros, Glenn H. Fredrickson</p>
            <p>We introduce a projected complex Langevin (CL) numerical sampling method -- a fictitious Langevin dynamics scheme that uses numerical projection to sample a constrained stationary distribution with highly oscillatory character. Despite the complex-valued degrees of freedom and associated sign-problem, the projected CL method succeeds as a natural extension of real-valued projected Langevin processes. In the new proposed method, complex-valued Lagrange multipliers are determined to enforce constraints to machine precision at each iteration. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we adapt the projected CL method to sample coherent state quantum field theories describing interacting Bose gases, which are realized in modern cold-atom experiments. We apply projected CL to two scenarios with holomorphic constraints, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, and show that projected CL reproduces the correct thermodynamic observables. We further observe improved numerical stability and accuracy at larger timesteps when compared to the previous state-of-the-art method for performing constrained CL sampling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Árpád Lukács, Róbert Trényi, Tamás Vértesi, Géza Tóth</p>
            <p>We discuss efficient methods to optimize the metrological performance over local Hamiltonians in a bipartite quantum system. For a given quantum state, our methods find the best local Hamiltonian for which the state outperforms separable states the most from the point of view of quantum metrology. We show that this problem can be reduced to maximize the quantum Fisher information over a certain set of Hamiltonians. We present the quantum Fisher information in a bilinear form and maximize it by an iterative see-saw (ISS) method, in which each step is based on semidefinite programming. We also solve the problem with the method of moments that works very well for smaller systems. We consider a number of other problems in quantum information theory that can be solved in a similar manner. For instance, we determine the bound entangled quantum states that maximally violate the Computable Cross Norm-Realignment (CCNR) criterion. Our approach is one of the efficient methods that can be applied for an optimization of the unitary dynamics in quantum metrology, the other methods being, for example, machine learning, variational quantum circuits, or neural networks. The advantage of our method is the fast and robust convergence due to the simple mathematical structure of the approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liubov A. Markovich, Attaallah Almasi, Sina Zeytinoğlu, Johannes Borregaard</p>
            <p>The estimation of many-qubit observables is an essential task of quantum information processing. The generally applicable approach is to decompose the observables into weighted sums of multi-qubit Pauli strings, i.e., tensor products of single-qubit Pauli matrices, which can readily be measured with single qubit rotations. The accumulation of shot noise in this approach, however, severely limits the achievable variance for a finite number of measurements. We introduce a novel method, dubbed Coherent Pauli Summation (CPS) that circumvents this limitation by exploiting access to a single-qubit quantum memory in which measurement information can be stored and accumulated. Our algorithm offers a reduction in the required number of measurements for a given variance that scales linearly with the number of Pauli strings of the decomposed observable. Our work demonstrates how a single long-coherence qubit memory can assist the operation of noisy many-qubit quantum devices in a cardinal task.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Junayed Hasan, M.R.C.Mahdy</p>
            <p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs), harnessing superposition and entanglement, have shown potential to surpass classical methods in complex learning tasks but remain limited by hardware constraints and noisy conditions. In this work, we present a novel framework for transferring knowledge from classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to QNNs via knowledge distillation, thereby reducing the need for resource intensive quantum training and error mitigation. We conduct extensive experiments using two parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with 4 and 8 qubits on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. The approach demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements attributed to distilled knowledge from larger classical networks. Through ablation studies, we systematically compare the effect of state of the art dimensionality reduction techniques fully connected layers, center cropping, principal component analysis, and pooling to compress high-dimensional image data prior to quantum encoding. Our findings reveal that fully connected layers retain the most salient features for QNN inference, thereby surpassing other down sampling approaches. Additionally, we examine state of the art data encoding methods (amplitude, angle, and qubit encoding) and identify amplitude encoding as the optimal strategy, yielding superior accuracy across all tested datasets and qubit configurations. Through computational analyses, we show that our distilled 4-qubit and 8-qubit QNNs achieve competitive performance while utilizing significantly fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. Our results establish a promising paradigm for bridging classical deep learning and emerging quantum computing, paving the way for more powerful, resource conscious models in quantum machine intelligence.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with >99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Zhi Wu, Marko Toroš, Sougato Bose, Anupam Mazumdar</p>
            <p>Matter-wave interferometry is susceptible to non-inertial noise sources, which can induce dephasing and a resulting loss of interferometric visibility. Here, we focus on inertial torsion noise (ITN), which arises from the rotational motion of the experimental apparatus suspended by a thin wire and subject to random external torques. We provide analytical expressions for the ITN noise starting from generalized Langevin equations describing the experimental box which can then be used together with the transfer function to obtain the dephasing factor. We verify the theoretical modelling and the validity of the approximations using Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining good agreement between theory and numerics. As an application, we estimate the size of the effects for the next generation of interferometry experiments with femtogram particles, which could be used as the building block for entanglement-based tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We find that the ambient gas is a weak source of ITN, posing mild restrictions on the ambient pressure and temperature. We discuss the general ITN constraints by assuming a Langevin equation parameterized by three phenomenological parameters.</p>

            <h2>Conservation Laws For Every Quantum Measurement Outcome</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Collins, Sandu Popescu</p>
            <p>In the paradigmatic example of quantum measurements, whenever one measures a system which starts in a superposition of two states of a conserved quantity, it jumps to one of the two states, implying different final values for the quantity that should have been conserved. The standard law of conservation for quantum mechanics handles this jump by stating only that the total distribution of the conserved quantity over repeated measurements is unchanged, but states nothing about individual cases. Here however we show that one can go beyond this and have conservation in each individual instance. We made our arguments in the case of angular momentum of a particle on a circle, where many technicalities simplify, and bring arguments to show that this holds in full generality. Hence we argue that the conservation law in quantum mechanics should be rewritten, to go beyond its hitherto statistical formulation, to state that the total of a conserved quantity is unchanged in every individual measurement outcome. As a further crucial element, we show that conservation can be localised at the level of the system of interest and its relevant frame of reference, and is independent on any assumptions on the distribution of the conserved quantity over the entire universe.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Federico Garcia-Gaitan, David J. Strachan, Petr Plechac, Stephen R. Clark, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renato M. S. Farias, Raghavendra D. Peddinti, Ingo Roth, Leandro Aolita</p>
            <p>We present a robust shadow estimation protocol for wide classes of low-depth measurement circuits that mitigates noise as long as the effective measurement map including noise is locally unitarily invariant. This is in practice an excellent approximation, encompassing for instance the case of ideal single-qubit Clifford gates composing the first circuit layer of an otherwise arbitrary circuit architecture and even non-Markovian, gate-dependent noise in the rest of the circuit. We argue that for weakly-correlated local noise, the measurement channel has an efficient matrix-product representation, and show how to estimate this directly from experimental data using tensor-network tools, eliminating the need for analytical or numeric calculations. We illustrate the relevance of our method with both numerics and proof-of-principle experiments on an IBM Quantum device. Numerically, we show that unmitigated shallow shadows with noisy circuits become more biased as the depth increases. In contrast, using the same number of samples, robust ultra-shallow shadows become more precise with increasing depth for relevant parameter regimes. The gain in sample efficiency is still limited by the noise per gate, resulting in an optimal circuit depth per noise level. Experimentally, we observe improved precision in two simple fidelity estimation tasks using five-qubit circuits with up to two layers of entangling gates, by about an order of magnitude. Under the practical constraints of current and near-term noisy quantum devices, our method maximally realizes the potential of shadow estimation with global rotations and identifies its fundamental limitations in the presence of noise.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masashi Wakamatsu</p>
            <p>The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integrals of the time-dependent vector potential along paths in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Owing to the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, this closed line-integral of the vector potential can be related to the integral of the electric and magnetic fields over the 2-dimensional area, the boundary of which is given by the above-mentioned closed path. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In the present paper, we carefully reanalyze their cancellation argument by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of the time-dependent external electromagnetic potential combined with more careful treatment of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. Careful analysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem shows that the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is partially correct but their central claim that only the time-independent part of the magnetic field contributes to the AB-phase shift so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect is not justified, thereby supporting likely existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.</p>

            <p>Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.</p>

To this end we introduce coherence (auto-concordance) of ensembles of quantum trajectories in the space-time. The coherence condition accounts phases proportional to classical action, which are in foundation of the Feynman path integral technique. Therefore, our interpretation is entirely based on well-known and tested concepts and methods of wave mechanics. Similarly to other ensemble interpretations our approach allows us to avoid all problems and paradoxes related to wave function collapse during a measurement process. Another consequence is that no quantum computation or quantum cryptography method will ever work if it assumes that a particular q-bit represents the entire wave function.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional systems are an important frontier for photonic quantum correlation experiments. These correlation tests commonly prescribe measurements with many possible outcomes but they are often implemented through many individual binary-outcome measurements that use only a single-detector. Here, we discuss how this binarisation procedure for multi-outcome measurements can open a loophole, unless specific device-characterisation assumptions are satisfied. We highlight that correlation tests designed for multi-outcome measurements can be trivialised in binarised implementations and we then show how to accurately analyse binarised data to reveal its quantum features. For seminal types of correlation experiments, such as Bell inequality tests, steering tests and prepare-and-measure experiments, we find that binarisation may incur a sizable cost in the magnitude of quantum advantages. This emphasizes the importance of both accurate data analysis and implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements in high-dimensional correlation experiments.</p>

            <p>We present a scheme for speeding up quantum measurement. The scheme builds on previous protocols that entangle the system to be measured with ancillary systems. In the idealised situation of perfect entangling operations and no decoherence, it gives an exact space-time trade-off meaning the readout speed increases linearly with the number of ancilla. We verify this scheme is robust against experimental imperfections through numerical modelling of gate noise and readout errors, and under certain circumstances our scheme can even lead to better than linear improvement in the speed of measurement with the number of systems measured. This hardware-agnostic approach is broadly applicable to a range of quantum technology platforms and offers a route to accelerate mid-circuit measurement as required for effective quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</p>

            <h2>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaromír Mika, Stuti Joshi, Robin Kaiser, Lukáš Slodička</p>
            <p>The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. Presented interferometry promises direct applications in Doppler-free atomic and molecular spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhdin Abdo Wodedo, Tesfay Gebremariam Tesfahannes, Tewodros Yirgashewa Darge, Berihu Teklu</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme that optimizes entanglement in nanomechanical resonators through quantum state transfer of squeezed fields assisted by radiation pressure. The system is driven by red-detuned laser fields, which enable simultaneous cooling of the mechanical resonators while facilitating the transfer of quantum states in a weak coupling, sideband-resolved regime. The mechanical entanglement is quantified using logarithmic negativity within the bipartite Gaussian states of the two mechanical modes. Our results show that the degree of mechanical entanglement is strongly influenced by several key parameters, including the parametric phase and nonlinear gain of the non-degenerate OPA, the squeezing strength of the injected squeezed vacuum reservoir, optomechanical cooperativity (controlled by laser drive power), and the mechanical bath temperature (phonon thermal excitation). Additionally, our results indicate that careful tuning of these parameters can enhance entanglement robustness, suggesting that this optomechanical scheme holds promise for applications in quantum sensing and information processing.</p>

            <h2>New random compiler for Hamiltonians via Markov Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benoît Dubus (Université libre de Bruxelles), Joseph Cunningham (Université libre de Bruxelles), Jérémie Roland (Université libre de Bruxelles)</p>
            <p>Many quantum algorithms, such as adiabatic algorithms (e.g. AQC) and phase randomisation, require simulating Hamiltonian evolution. In addition, the simulation of physical systems is an important objective in its own right. In many cases, the Hamiltonian is complex at first sight, but can be decomposed as a linear combination of simple ones; for instance, a sum of local Hamiltonians for Ising models or a sum of time-independent Hamiltonians with time-dependent coefficients (which is typically the case for adiabatic algorithms). In this paper we develop a new compiler, similar to the first order randomized Trotter, or qDRIFT, but with an arguably simpler framework. It is more versatile as it supports a large class of randomisation schemes and as well as time-dependent weights. We first present the model and derive its governing equations. We then define and analyze the simulation error for a sum of two Hamiltonians, and generalize it to a sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians. We prove that the number of gates necessary to simulate the weighted sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians of magnitude $C$ during a time $T$ with an error less than $\epsilon_0$ grows as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(C^2T^2\epsilon_0^{-1}\right)$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeniy O. Kiktenko, Andrey Tayduganov, Aleksey K. Fedorov</p>
            <p>We develop a novel key routing algorithm for quantum key distribution (QKD) networks that utilizes a distribution of keys between remote, i.e., not directly connected by a QKD link, nodes through multiple non-overlapping paths. This approach enchases the security of QKD network by minimizing potential vulnerabilities associated with individual trusted nodes. The algorithm ensures a balanced allocation of the workload across the QKD network links, while aiming for the target key generation rate between directly connected and remote nodes. We present the results of testing the algorithm on two QKD network models consisting of 6 and 10 nodes. The testing demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to distribute secure keys among the nodes of the network in an all-to-all manner, ensuring that the information-theoretic security of the keys between remote nodes is maintained even when one of the trusted nodes is compromised. These results highlight the potential of the algorithm to improve the performance of QKD networks.</p>

            <h2>A Classical Analogue of Entanglement for a Kicked Top</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bilal Khalid, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>It is widely believed that quantum mechanics cannot exhibit chaos, since unitarity of time evolution ensures that distances between quantum states are preserved. However, a parallel argument can be constructed in classical mechanics that would seem to deny the existence of classical chaos too. The argument works by describing classical states as probability distributions in phase space and showing that the inner product between distributions on phase space is preserved under Liouvillian dynamics. Thus, the more faithful classical analogy of a quantum state is not a single phase space trajectory but is instead a phase space distribution, and chaos in such states must be identified by some statistical signatures instead of exponential separation of nearby states. The search for these signatures is the primary goal in quantum chaos research. However, this perspective also naturally motivates the search for classical analogues of these signatures, to reveal the inner machinery of chaos in quantum systems. One widely recognized signature of chaos in quantum systems is the dynamical generation of entanglement. Chaos in the classical system is correlated with a greater entanglement production in the corresponding quantum system. One of the most well-studied examples of this is the kicked top model. In this paper, we construct a classical analogue of bipartite entanglement in terms of the mutual information between phase space distributions of subsystems and find completely analogous signatures of chaos as those found in entanglement for the kicked top Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Color centers in diamond provide a possible hardware for quantum computation, where the most basic quantum information processing unit are nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, each in contact with adjacent carbon nuclear spins. With specifically tailored dynamical decoupling sequences, it is possible to execute selective, high-fidelity two-body gates between the electron spin of the NV center and a targeted nuclear spin. In this work, we present a method to determine the optimal execution time that balances the trade-off between fidelity and execution speed for gates generated by adaptive XY sequences. With these optimized gates, we use the nuclear spin environment as a code space for quantum error correction within a color center register.</p>

            <p>Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</p>

            <p>Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</p>

            <p>A finite-dimensional Hilbert space is usually described by using an orthonormal basis, but a more general description can be obtained by using a tight frame. The frame-dependent coherence, defined by following the analogy with the basis-dependent coherence, allows us to define the coherence with respect to several orthogonal bases considered simultaneously or with respect to a discrete system of coherent states. By using this more general definition, we can investigate how the basis-dependent coherence changes when we go from a basis to another one, from a basis to a complementary one. Frame-dependent coherence of a quantum state coincides with the basis-dependent coherence of the corresponding state in a Neumark extension.</p>

            <p>Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) is a crucial architectural component for querying classical or quantum data in superposition, enabling algorithms with wide-ranging applications in quantum arithmetic, quantum chemistry, machine learning, and quantum cryptography. In this work, we introduce Fat-Tree QRAM, a novel query architecture capable of pipelining multiple quantum queries simultaneously while maintaining desirable scalings in query speed and fidelity. Specifically, Fat-Tree QRAM performs $O(\log (N))$ independent queries in $O(\log (N))$ time using $O(N)$ qubits, offering immense parallelism benefits over traditional QRAM architectures. To demonstrate its experimental feasibility, we propose modular and on-chip implementations of Fat-Tree QRAM based on superconducting circuits and analyze their performance and fidelity under realistic parameters. Furthermore, a query scheduling protocol is presented to maximize hardware utilization and access the underlying data at an optimal rate. These results suggest that Fat-Tree QRAM is an attractive architecture in a shared memory system for practical quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</p>

Here we demonstrate the precision measurement of the microwave electric field by cavity-enhanced critical behavior. We show that the equivalent measurement sensitivity of the microwave electric field can be enhanced by an order of magnitude compared with that in free space. The obtained sensitivity can be enhanced to 2.6 nV/cm/Hz$^{1/2}$.</p>

This integration not only facilitates the exploration of potential applications in quantum information processing but also enables the study of material's fundamental properties using microwave techniques. While most studies employ 2D coplanar architectures with scalability potential, 3D cavity based c-QED devices, due to their simpler design, offer the advantage of a quicker turnaround to probe the composite Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, we construct the first flux-tunable, 3D cavity-compatible superconducting quantum circuit based on 2D materials, featuring a graphene superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) shunted by a capacitor that is accessible by both DC and microwave probes. We have shown how flux-modulated cavity frequency can be linked to the SQUID critical current under the influence of Fraunhofer pattern. In addition, we extracted the symmetry information of the SQUIDs based on DC analysis, and correlated this with the flux-modulated cavity frequency observed in microwave measurements. Our platform can extend to topological materials, holding the prospect of establishing valid topological JJs with DC probe while allowing fast microwave probe to avoid quasiparticle poisoning.</p>

            <p>In this work, we combine the many-body formulation of the internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC) method with Evangelista's multireference formulation of the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). The DSRG method can be viewed as a unitary multireference coupled cluster theory, which renormalizes the amplitudes based on a flow equation approach to eliminate numerical instabilities. We extend this approach by demonstrating that the unitary flow equation approach can be adapted for nonunitary transformations, rationalizing the renormalization of ic-MRCC amplitudes. We denote the new approach, the renormalized ic-MRCC (ric-MRCC) method. To achieve high accuracy with a reasonable computational cost, we introduce a new approximation to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We fully consider the linear commutator while approximating the quadratic commutator, for which we neglect specific contractions involving amplitudes with active indices. Moreover, we introduce approximate perturbative triples to obtain the ric-MRCCSD[T] method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approaches in comparison to advanced multireference methods for the potential energy curves of H8, F2, H2O, N2, and Cr2. Additionally, we show that ric-MRCCSD and ric-MRCSSD[T] match the accuracy of CCSD(T) for evaluating spectroscopic constants and of full configuration interaction energies for a set of small molecules.</p>

            <p>The quantum anomaly of a global symmetry is known to strongly constrain the allowed low-energy physics in a clean and isolated quantum system. However, the effect of quantum anomalies in disordered systems is much less understood, especially when the global symmetry is only preserved on average by the disorder. In this work, we focus on disordered systems with both average and exact symmetries $A\times K$, where the exact symmetry $K$ is respected in every disorder configuration, and the average $A$ is only preserved on average by the disorder ensemble. When there is a mixed quantum anomaly between the average and exact symmetries, we argue that the mixed state representing the ensemble of disordered ground states cannot be featureless. While disordered mixed states smoothly connected to the anomaly-compatible phases in clean limit are certainly allowed, we also found disordered phases that have no clean-limit counterparts, including the glassy states with strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and average topological orders for certain anomalies. We construct solvable lattice models to demonstrate each of these possibilities. We also provide a field-theoretic argument to provide a criterion for whether a given average-exact mixed anomaly admits a compatible average topological order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhajit Barman, Pradeep Kumawat, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi</p>
            <p>We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the future-past light cone regions of a Minkowski spacetime as well as in the region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the light cone regions, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a static mirror is synchronized with Minkowski time while the static atom is using a frame in the light cone, $(ii)$ a static atom is using Minkowski time, and the mirror is using the light cone frame. Analogous scenarios in the black hole spacetime are -- the static mirror uses future Kruskal frame while the static atom uses the Schwarzschild coordinates, defined inside the black hole, and vice-versa. The calculations, depending upon the frame of the atom, are respectively done within the light cone, Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and Kruskal time-interaction pictures. In all of these scenarios, we observe that the excitation probabilities contain a thermal factor and are periodic on the separation between the atom and the mirror, contrasting the uniform acceleration scenario. The above two scenarios in $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone regions appear to be the same when we equate the field and atomic frequencies. However, the same is not true when we consider the $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone or the Schwarzschild interior regions. We also estimate the de-excitation probabilities and encounter similar situations. However, we observe that the ratio between the excitation and corresponding de-excitation probabilities resembles the classical equivalence in motion at the quantum level. The excitation to de-excitation ratios (EDRs) corresponding to analogous scenarios are equal for equal atomic and field frequencies. This bolsters our earlier proposal on the relevance of EDRs in the context of the equivalence principle.</p>

            <p>We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions-periodic for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations, which induce large impurity-impurity correlations that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information, respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to impurity clusters delocalized along the system. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.</p>

            <p>We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a multi-loop nested structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation integrated single-photon emitters (SPEs). However, significant variability in the emission energies of 2D SPEs presents a major challenge in producing identical single photons from different SPEs, which may become crucial for various quantum applications including quantum information processing. Although various approaches to dynamically tuning the emission energies of 2D SPEs have been developed to address the issue, the practical solution to matching multiple individual SPEs in a single 2D flake is still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate a precise emission energy tuning of individual SPEs in a WSe2 monolayer. Our approach utilizes localized strain fields near individual SPEs, which we control independently by adjusting the physical volume of an SU-8-based stressor layer via focused laser annealing. This technique allows continuous emission energy tuning of up to 15 meV while maintaining the qualities of SPEs. Additionally, we showcase the precise spectral alignment of three distinct SPEs in a single WSe2 monolayer to the same wavelength. The tunability of 2D SPEs represents a solid step towards the on-chip integrated photonics with 2D materials for quantum technologies.</p>

However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge so far. In this work, we propose an Ansatz for the critical state, and argue that critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both dual spaces. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we demonstrate that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, also exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces. Subsequent numerical simulations verify the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</p>

Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that interactions could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into an intermediate mobility edge phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <h2>Asymptotic Freedom of Two Heavy Impurities in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong-Chen Zheng, Lin Wen, Renyuan Liao</p>
            <p>We consider two heavy impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, and calculate the self-energy using the Wilsonian renormalization. The polaron energy, quasiparticle residue and damping rate are extracted from the self-energy. We demonstrate that various effective potentials emerge from the polaron energy under the specific conditions. In the limit of large separation between the impurities, the polaron spectrum converges to the results for a single impurity, exhibiting an attractive-repulsive crossover across the Feshbach resonance. The boundary of this crossover is identified through the analysis of the damping rate. We highlight that repulsive-dominant polarons can exist as long as the impurities are sufficiently close, even when the impurity-boson interactions are attractive. Additionally, we observe that the two impurities become asymptotically free in the repulsive polaron regime. These results are verifiable and offer a fresh perspective on the interaction dynamics between two polarons.</p>

            <h2>From Staging to Insight: An Educational Path to Understanding Bell's Inequalities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentina De Renzi, Matteo G. A. Paris, Maria Bondani</p>
            <p>Quantum Physics is a cornerstone of modern science and technology, yet a comprehensive approach to integrating it into school curricula and communicating its foundations to policymakers, industrial stakeholders, and the general public has yet to be established. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for introducing entanglement and Bell's inequalities to a non-expert audience, and how these topics have been presented in the exhibit "Dire l'indicibile" ("Speaking the Unspeakable"), as a part of the Italian Quantum Weeks project. This initiative aims to make quantum mechanics accessible to all, bridging the gap between complex scientific principles and public understanding. Our approach meets the challenge of simplifying quantum concepts without sacrificing their core meaning, specifically avoiding the risks of oversimplification and inaccuracy. Through interactive activities, including a card game demonstration and the staging of CHSH experiments, participants explore the fundamental differences between classical and quantum probabilistic predictions. They gain insights into the significance of Bell inequality verification experiments and the implications of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Preliminary results from both informal and formal assessment sessions are encouraging, suggesting the effectiveness of this approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mayank, K. Hari, Subhajit Barman, Dawood Kothawala</p>
            <p>We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate an unambiguous quantum state discrimination of two qubit states under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity-time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry in a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. We show that any two non-orthogonal states can become orthogonal subjected to time evolution of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian in both the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry preserving and broken regimes, thus can be discriminated deterministically. For a given pair of candidate states, we show that the parameters of the Hamiltonian must be confined in a proper range, within which there exists an optimal choice to realize quantum brachistochrone for the fastest orthogonalization. Besides, we provide a clear geometric picture and some analytic results to understand the main conclusions.

We found that optical dipole traps with higher-order spatial forms inherently offer lower decoherence rates compared to those with lower-order spatial forms. We formulated the decoherence rate caused by the variance of the differential energy shift and photon jumping rate. Then, we constructed blue-detuned harmonic and quartic optical dipole traps, and experimentally investigated the coherence time of a trapped single cesium atom. The experimental results qualitatively verified our theory. Our approach provides a novel method to enhance the coherence time of optically trapped neutral atoms.</p>

            <h2>The iSWAP gate with polar molecules: Robustness criteria for entangling operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Bergonzoni, Sven Jandura, Guido Pupillo</p>
            <p>Ultracold polar molecules trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays are an emerging platform for quantum information processing and quantum simulation, thanks to their rich internal structure and long-range dipolar interactions. Recent experimental breakthroughs have enabled precise control over individual molecules, paving the way for implementing two-qubit quantum gates, based on the iSWAP gate. A key challenge is however the sensitivity to variations of the dipole-dipole interaction strength - stemming from motion of the molecules and uncertainty on the precise positioning of external confining potentials - that limits current gate fidelities. To address this, we develop a quantum optimal control framework, based on a perturbative approach, to design gates that are robust with respect to quasi-static deviations of either system Hamiltonian parameters, external control parameters, or both, and provide criteria to evaluate a priori whether a gate can be made robust for a given control Hamiltonian. By applying these criteria to exchange-coupled qubits, as polar molecules, we demonstrate that robustness cannot be achieved with global controls only, but can be attained by breaking the exchange symmetry through local controls, such as a local detuning. We determine the robust time-optimal solution for realizing an iSWAP gate, show that the control pulses can be designed to be smooth functions, and achieve theoretical gate fidelities compatible with error correction using reasonable experimental parameters. Additionally, we show that certain entangled state preparations, such as Bell states, can be made robust even with global controls only.</p>

            <h2>Realizing quantum optics in structured environments with giant atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wang, Huai-Bing Zhu, Tao Liu, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>To go beyond quantum optics in free-space setups, atom-light interfaces with structured photonic environments are often employed to realize unconventional quantum electrodynamics (QED) phenomena. However, when employed as quantum buses, those long-distance nanostructures are limited by fabrication disorders. In this work, we alternatively propose to realize structured lightmatter interactions by engineering multiple coupling points of hybrid giant atom-conventionalenvironments without any periodic structure. We present a generic optimization method to obtain the real-space coupling sequence for multiple coupling points. We report a broadband chiral emission in a very wide frequency regime, with no analog in other quantum setups. Moreover, we show that the QED phenomena in the band gap environment, such as fractional atomic decay and dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a bound state, can be observed in our setup. Numerical results indicate that our proposal is robust against fabrication disorders of the coupling sequence. Our work opens up a new route for realizing unconventional light-matter interactions.</p>

            <p>Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. Yet, it remains experimentally challenging to investigate such dynamics with high spectroscopic resolution in both frequency and momentum space, particularly in two-dimensional correlated systems. Here, we leverage Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a powerful and non-invasive tool to study thin-film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO), revealing several distinct dynamical phenomena across the superconducting phase diagram. At zero magnetic field and low temperatures, NV depolarization ($T_1$) noise spectroscopy captures the low-frequency (GHz-scale) magnetic noise generated by nodal superconducting quasiparticle excitations, in agreement with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory. Near the critical temperature $T_c \approx 90$ K, supercurrent-fluctuation-induced noise leads to a sharp reduction of the NV $T_1$. By carefully analyzing the temperature-scaling of $T_1$, we observe clear deviations from the BCS prediction, reflecting the importance of order parameter fluctuations and enabling the determination of both static and dynamical critical exponents. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of NV $T_1$ near $T_c$; the field-induced smearing of the transition unveils the presence of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, NV decoherence ($T_2$) noise spectroscopy allows us to characterize magnetic noise at even lower MHz-scale frequencies and obtain evidence for complex vortex-solid fluctuations well below $T_c$. Our results establish quantum noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dihang Sun, Zhigang Hu, Biao Wu</p>
            <p>We investigate the mixed-state entanglement between two spins embedded in the XXZ Heisenberg chain under thermal equilibrium. By deriving an analytical expression for the entanglement of two-spin thermal states and extending this analysis to larger spin chains, we demonstrate that mixed-state entanglement is profoundly shaped by both disorder and temperature. Our results reveal a sharp distinction between many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic phases, with entanglement vanishing above different finite temperature thresholds. Furthermore, by analyzing non-adjacent spins, we uncover an approximate exponential decay of entanglement with separation. This work advances the understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition by linking the entanglement properties of small subsystems to the broader thermal environment, offering a explanation for the absence of entanglement in macroscopic systems. These findings provide critical insights into quantum many-body physics, bridging concepts from thermalization, localization, and quantum information theory.</p>

            <h2>Quantum natural gradient with thermal-state initialization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are central to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), yet their performance is hindered by complex loss landscapes that make their trainability challenging. Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parameterized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed in [Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020)], by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid Measurement Scheme for Generating nonGaussian Spin States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Kolmer Forbes, Ivan H. Deutsch</p>
            <p>We present a protocol for generating nonclassical states of atomic spin ensembles through the backaction induced by a hybrid measurement of light that is entangled with atoms, combining both homodyne and single photon detection. In phase-I of the protocol we create a spin squeezed state by measuring the light's polarization rotation due to the Faraday effect in a balanced polarimeter, equivalent to a homodyne measurement. In phase-II we send a second probe beam through the sample and detect single photons scattered into the signal mode. Before doing so, we rotate the uncertainty bubble to increase the projection fluctuations of the measured spin component. This increases the coupling strength between the atoms and photons and thus the rate of scattering of single photons into the signal mode. In the ideal case, the result is a squeezed Dicke state, with substantial quantum advantage for sensing spin rotations. We benchmark the protocol's utility in the presence of inevitable decoherence due to optical pumping using the Fisher information as a measure of quantum advantage. We show that in the presence of decoherence, the quantum Fisher information associated with the nonGaussian mixed state we prepare is substantially larger than the classical Fisher information obtained from the standard measurement of spin rotations. We deduce a measurement basis that is close to optimal for achieving the quantum Cramér Rao bound in the presence of decoherence.</p>

These distinct regimes, manifesting themselves in single-photon scattering, allow flexible reflection control due to their analogy to those of a small- and giant-atom interactions with the waveguide. We also derive scattering criteria for Rydberg blockade and Rydberg antiblockade, corresponding to specific single-photon reflection spectrum. Based on these criteria, the blockade and antiblockade distances can be estimated.</p>

            <p>A fully connected quantum network with a wavelength division multiplexing architecture plays an increasingly pivotal role in quantum information technology. With such architecture, an entanglement-based network has been demonstrated in which an entangled photon-pair source distributes quantum entanglement resources to many users. Despite these remarkable advances, the scalability of the architecture could be constrained by the finite spectrum resource, where O(N^2)wavelength channels are needed to connect N users, thus impeding further progress in real-world scenarios. Here, we propose an optimized scheme for the wavelength division multiplexing entanglement-based network using a state-multiplexing quantum light source. With a dual-pump configuration, the feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by generating state-multiplexing photon pairs at multiple wavelength channels with a silicon nitride microring resonator chip. In our demonstration, we establish a fully connected graph between four users with six wavelength channels - saving half of which without sacrificing functionality and performance of the secure communication. A total asymptotic secure key rate of 1946.9 bps is obtained by performing the BBM92 protocol with the distributed state.

            <p>We experimentally realize a new cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) platform with defect-free single-atom array strongly coupled to an optical cavity. The defect-free single-atom array is obtained by rearranging a probabilistically loaded one-dimensional (1D) optical tweezer array with dimensions of $1 \times 40$. The atom array is enclosed with two cavity mirrors, which compose a miniature optical Fabry-P{é}rot cavity with cavity length of 1.15 mm. By precisely controlling the position of the atom array, we demonstrate uniform and strong coupling of all atoms in the array with the optical cavity. The average coupling strength between the single atom and the cavity is 2.62 MHz. The vacuum Rabi splitting spectra for single-atom arrays with atom number $N$ changing from 3 to 26 are measured. Thus, the collective enhancement of the coupling strength with ${\sqrt N}$-dependence for multiple atoms is validated at the single atom level.

            <p>Photon indistinguishability, entanglement, and antibunching are key ingredients in quantum optics and photonics. Decay cascades in quantum emitters offer a simple method to create entangled photon-pairs with negligible multi-pair generation probability. However, the degree of indistinguishability of the photons emitted in a cascade is intrinsically limited by the lifetime ratio of the involved transitions. Here we show that, for the biexciton-exciton cascade in a quantum dot, this ratio can be widely tuned by an applied electric field. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements of two subsequently emitted biexciton photons show that their indistinguishability increases with increasing field, following the theoretically predicted behavior. At the same time, the emission linewidth stays close to the transform-limit, favoring applications relying on the interference among photons emitted by different sources.</p>

            <p>This paper uncovers the formation of topological edge polaritons that are protected by the presence of quantum vacuum. Such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons could be achieved in a system of neutral atomic lattice under appropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the light-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which consequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the system is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit, i.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On the other hand, by treating both the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full (atomic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of topological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge and with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons against spatial disorder and counterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.</p>

            <p>While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.</p>

Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. S. Araujo, K. Khan, G.H. Aguilar, A. S. Coelho</p>
            <p>Quantum optics plays a crucial role in developing quantum computers on different platforms. In photonics, precise control over light's degrees of freedom, including discrete variables (polarization, photon number, orbital angular momentum) and continuous variables (phase, amplitude quadratures, frequency), is fundamental. Our model manipulates photonic systems to encode and process quantum information via the photon's spatial degree of freedom, employing polarization as an auxiliary qubit. We propose a programmable photonic circuit that simulates quantum channels, including phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and bit-flip channels, through adjustable interferometric parameters. Furthermore, the interferometer extends to complex channels, such as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping. This work contributes to advancing quantum simulation techniques and serves as a foundation for exploring quantum computing applications, while highlighting pathways for their practical implementation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Zhang, Neil Lambert, Xin-Qi Li, Mauro Cirio, Pengfei Liang</p>
            <p>The theory of purified pseudomodes [arXiv:2412.04264 (2024)] was recently developed to provide a numerical tool for the analysis of the properties of a quantum system and the environment it couples to via linear system-bath interactions. Here we extend this theory to allow for the description of general nonlinear system-bath interactions. We demonstrate the validity of our method by considering the spontaneous decay of a two-level atom placed inside a single-mode lossy cavity and furthermore, its potential application to nanophotonics by calculating the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a quantum dot in the presence of a phonon environment. Our method provides a useful tool for the study of phonon-assisted emission in quantum dots and holds the the promise for broad applications in fields like quantum biology, nonlinear phononics, and nanophotonics.</p>

            <h2>Highly nondegenerate polarization-entangled photon pairs produced through noncritical phasematching in single-domain KTiOPO$_4$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Boon Chin, Diane Prato, Alexander Ling</p>
            <p>Photon-pair sources are useful for entanglement distribution. The most mature of these are spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) sources, most of which achieve phasematching via engineering the domains in poled crystals or the angle between the optic axis and the pump beam. For multi-channel entanglement distribution of photon pairs, where one photon is transmitted through free-space and the other photon is transmitted through fiber, it is beneficial to use highly nondegenerate photon-pair sources. The currently accepted approach in such sources is quasi-phasematching. In this paper, a simpler, more stable alternative is presented for producing highly nondegenerate photon pairs. A source of polarization-entangled photon pairs with low temperature sensitivity based on noncritical phasematched (NCPM) SPDC in single-domain potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) was demonstrated. Over a crystal temperature range of $75^\circ$C, the center wavelength of the idler photons was observed to change by $10.8$nm while the average entanglement visibility was maintained above $98\%$. With the signal photons detected locally, the idler photons were transmitted through 62km and 93km of deployed telecom fibers with average raw visibilities of $98.2(1)\%$ and $95.6(3)\%$ respectively.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation of quantum entanglement state between photoelectron spin and emitted photon polarization in spin and polarization resolved XEPECS of $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo B. Tanaka, Goro Oohata, Takayuki Uozumi</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigated the mechanism of quantum entanglement between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ XEPECS process for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$. In the calculation, we used a realistic $\rm TiO_{6}$-type cluster model with the full multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between the Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. We found that quantum entanglement occurs between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons and that it depends on the angular geometry in the XEPECS process. In addition, we found that the degree of spin and polarization entanglement decreases as the Ti 3$d\ $- O 2$p$ hybridization becomes stronger and as the crystal field modifies the electronic states in terms of the tangle, an index for the degree of entanglement. These results highlight the crucial role of the charge transfer and crystal field effects in determining entanglement properties in real material systems.</p>

The dependence of the efficiency and transfer of the scenario on the number of donor cavities, the number of atoms in them, and the bandwidth of the waveguides is investigated.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum Rabi model (QRM) in the deep strong coupling (DSC) regime. To capture the full dynamics of the QRM in the DSC regime, we implemented single-qubit rotations combined with integrated digital steps and qubit-bosonic blocks. This approach leads to a paradigm known as digital analog quantum simulations (DAQSs). In this work, we review the encoding of QRM in the DSC regime through emerging paradigms of digital and analog techniques. Using DAQSs encoding, an efficient simulation can be performed on state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms. Finally, we provide detailed information on the dynamics of the QRM in varity of parameter regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAQS paradigms in achieving prolonged coherent measurements during time evolution, even in the case of perturbative DSC regime dynamics. This proposal lays the groundwork for simulating complex many-body dynamics that involve bosonic modes.</p>

            <p>Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is a powerful method for label-free imaging and spectroscopy of materials. Recent experiments have shown that quantum-enhanced Raman scattering can surpass the shot noise limit and improve the sensitivity substantially. Here, we introduce a full theory of quantum-enhanced SRS based on the framework of quantum metrology. Our results enable the assessment of quantum-enhancements of arbitrary measurement strategies and identify optimal measurement observables that extract maximal information about the signal. We use this to identify the optimal employment of squeezed states in SRS, highlighting the potential to improve quantum gains beyond those observed in recent experiments. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding and approaching the quantum limits of precision in SRS, and provide a tool to discuss nonlinear spectroscopy and imaging more broadly.</p>

            <p>The key features of density-functional theory (DFT) within a minimalistic implementation of quantum electrodynamics are demonstrated, thus allowing to study elementary properties of quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT). We primarily employ the quantum Rabi model, that describes a two-level system coupled to a single photon mode, and also discuss the Dicke model, where multiple two-level systems couple to the same photon mode. In these settings, the density variables of the system are the polarization and the displacement of the photon field. We give analytical expressions for the constrained-search functional and the exchange-correlation potential and compare to established results from QEDFT. We further derive a form for the adiabatic connection that is almost explicit in the density variables, up to only a non-explicit correlation term that gets bounded both analytically and numerically. This allows several key features of DFT to be studied without approximations.</p>

            <p>Learning quantum states is a crucial task for realizing quantum information technology. Recently, neural approaches have emerged as promising methods for learning quantum states. We propose a meta-learning model that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the process of learning quantum states. To improve the data efficiency of the RL, we introduce an action repetition strategy inspired by curriculum learning. The RL agent significantly improves the sample efficiency of learning random quantum states, and achieves infidelity scaling close to the Heisenberg limit. We also show that the RL agent trained using 3-qubit states can generalize to learning up to 5-qubit states. These results highlight the utility of RL-driven meta-learning to enhance the efficiency and generalizability of learning quantum states. Our approach can be applied to improve quantum control, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning.</p>

            <p>Applying quantum chemistry algorithms to large-scale systems requires substantial computational resources scaled with the system size and the desired accuracy. To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at this https URL, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms. Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as Møller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level. All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for Møller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions. For the advanced quantum embedding feature, two representative examples are demonstrated: the water cluster problem (2,752 orbitals) and a water monomer adsorbed on a boron nitride surface (3,929 orbitals), achieving the gold-standard accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin</p>
            <p>Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</p>

            <p>We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered resonant version of resonant Förster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.</p>

            <p>We introduce a computational framework for simulating non-adiabatic vibronic dynamics on circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms. Our approach leverages hybrid oscillator-qubit quantum hardware with mid-circuit measurements and resets, enabling the incorporation of environmental effects such as dissipation and dephasing. To demonstrate its capabilities, we simulate energy transfer dynamics in a triad model of photosynthetic chromophores inspired by natural antenna systems. We specifically investigate the role of dissipation during the relaxation dynamics following photoexcitation, where electronic transitions are coupled to the evolution of quantum vibrational modes. Our results indicate that hybrid oscillator-qubit devices, operating with noise levels below the intrinsic dissipation rates of typical molecular antenna systems, can achieve the simulation fidelity required for practical computations on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms.</p>

Assuming a quantum version of the light bending interaction, we show that it leads to decoherence of the mass if the light is not observed. Using the extreme weakness of the gravitational coupling, we derive explicitly the decoherence lengthscales for general states of the central mass and for both thermal and coherent light. Predictably, the effect is very faint for anything but hugely energetic light, however from the fundamental point of view of co-existence of both gravitation and quantum theories, it is there. Since effectively the studied system is a quantum optomechanical system, we hope our results, properly rescaled, will be also useful in optomechanics.</p>

            <p>Strong coupling between single qubits is crucial for quantum information science and quantum computation. However, it is still challenged, especially for single solid-state qubit. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system, consisting of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator weakly coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy spin in diamond and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) nanosphere holding Kerr magnons, to realize strong long-distance spin-spin coupling. With a strong driving field on magnons, the Kerr effect can squeeze magnons, and {thus the coupling between the CPW resonator and the sequeezed magnons is exponentially enhanced}, which produces two cavity-magnon polaritons, i.e., the high-frequency polariton (HP) and low-frequency polariton (LP). When the enhanced cavity-magnon coupling {approaches} the critical value (i.e., the frequency of the LP becomes zero), the spin is fully decoupled from the HP, while the coupling between the spin and the LP is significantly improved. In the dispersive regime, a strong spin-spin coupling mediated by the LP is achieved with accessible parameters. Our proposal indicates that the critical cavity-magnon polarition is a potential interface to realize strong spin-spin coupling and manipulates remote solid spins.</p>

            <p>Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</p>

            <p>The most advanced techniques using fault-tolerant quantum computers to estimate the ground-state energy of a chemical Hamiltonian involve compression of the Coulomb operator through tensor factorizations, enabling efficient block-encodings of the Hamiltonian. A natural challenge of these methods is the degree to which block-encoding costs can be reduced. We address this challenge through the technique of spectrum amplification, which magnifies the spectrum of the low-energy states of Hamiltonians that can be expressed as sums of squares. Spectrum amplification enables estimating ground-state energies with significantly improved cost scaling in the block encoding normalization factor $\Lambda$ to just $\sqrt{2\Lambda E_{\text{gap}}}$, where $E_{\text{gap}} \ll \Lambda$ is the lowest energy of the sum-of-squares Hamiltonian. To achieve this, we show that sum-of-squares representations of the electronic structure Hamiltonian are efficiently computable by a family of classical simulation techniques that approximate the ground-state energy from below. In order to further optimize, we also develop a novel factorization that provides a trade-off between the two leading Coulomb integral factorization schemes -- namely, double factorization and tensor hypercontraction -- that when combined with spectrum amplification yields a factor of 4 to 195 speedup over the state of the art in ground-state energy estimation for models of Iron-Sulfur complexes and a CO$_{2}$-fixation catalyst.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He Zheng, Daniel A. Steck</p>
            <p>The worldline path-integral method, developed thus far for scalar fields, offers promising computational efficiency in general geometries, However, it relies so far on the scalar approximation that decomposes electromagnetic waves into two independent polarizations. In this work, we investigate different theoretical frameworks of fluctuation-induced effects and analyze the limitations of the worldline path-integral method in modeling multiple-atom Casimir-Polder interactions. In particular, we ask the question: how accurate is the scalar approximation? Using the worldline approach, it appears that a simple sum of the contributions from the two polarizations agrees with the exact Casimir-Polder force for two-atom systems. However, it turns out that this agreement is fortuitous. To enable calculations beyond two atoms via worldlines, we develop general $N$-atom expressions for the Casimir-Polder force within the scalar approximation. For three-body systems, the scalar worldline method fails drastically, predicting significant discrepancies in both magnitude and sign due to strong polarization mixing. Furthermore, we show that the TE/TM decomposition in the worldline method differs from that of the Green-tensor formalism, and we discuss why this is. This study highlights the inadequacy of scalar worldline models that rely on the polarization-decomposition approximation in general geometries.</p>

            <p>Rare earth ions (REI) in solid materials are among the leading systems for quantum technology applications. However, developing practical REI quantum devices with long-lived coherent states remains challenging due to great growth difficulties of high-quality REI materials and a lack of comprehensive understanding of REI's decoherence mechanisms. Here we realize a record optical coherence time of 421.5 $\pm$ 10.5 $\mu$s for the $^7$F$_0\rightarrow^5$D$_0$ transition and more than 30 hours lifetime for the $^7$F$_0$ hyperfine spin states in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ optical ceramics. We report the elimination of two-level-system induced optical decoherence in short-range ordered crystals. Meanwhile, a new decoherence mechanism caused by new kinds of perturbing magnetic centers is identified below 1.5 K. We further demonstrate the coherent light storage over 5 $\mu$s by using the atomic frequency comb protocol. These results open up prospects for the realization of practical quantum memories and large scale quantum communications with REI optical ceramics.</p>

            <p>Squeezed light constitutes a key resource for quantum optical technologies including quantum sensing, computing, communication and metrology. For many applications, however, the generation of squeezed light typically requires at least two nonlinear optical stages involving careful phase and frequency matching to achieve the required mixing of squeezed and coherent light. In our work, we introduce an on-chip system that simplifies the generation of coherent-squeezed light, utilizing only a single squeezing stage. We achieved this by pumping a silicon nitride ($\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$) microring resonator to produce single-mode squeezed light through four-wave mixing at the same frequency as the pump mode, leveraging the inherent $\chi^{(3)}$-nonlinearity of the $\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$ resonator. Our on-chip system demonstrates a squeezing of -4.7 dB, and we provide a theoretical model that describes the straightforward yet robust generation of single-mode squeezing at the injection locking point of the ring resonator. Overall, our findings highlight an approach which drastically simplifies the generation of squeezed light in photonic integrated circuits.</p>

            <p>A microwave-optical photon converter with high efficiency ($>50$ %) and low added noise ($\ll 1$ photon) could enable the creation of scalable quantum networks where quantum information is distributed optically and processed in the microwave regime. However, integrated converters demonstrated to date lack sufficient co-operativity or are too lossy to provide the required performance. Here we propose a bi-directional microwave-optical converter employing an ensemble of spin-bearing color centers hosted within a high-Q Si photonic resonator and coupled magnetically to a high-Q superconducting microwave resonator. We develop a theory for microwave-optical conversion when the ensemble of centers is strongly hybridized with one or both cavities, and find a counterintuitive operating point where microwave and optical photons are tuned to bare center/cavity resonances. Compared to the perturbative coupling regime, we find a substantially enhanced nonlinearity, making it possible to obtain the required co-operativity with reduced pump- and center-induced losses, and improved robustness to optical inhomogeneous broadening. Taking color center and optical pump-induced losses into account in both the Si photonic and superconducting resonators, we find that $\sim 95$ % total efficiency and added noise $\ll 1$ quanta is possible at low ($\mu$W) pump powers for both Er- and T-centers in Si. Our results open new pathways towards quantum networks using microwave-optical converters.</p>

            <h2>Measurement Uncertainty in Infrared Spectroscopy with Entangled Photon Pairs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue Zhang, Zhucheng Zhang, Hui Dong</p>
            <p>Spectroscopy with entanglement has shown great potential to break limitations of traditional spectroscopic measurements, yet the role of entanglement in spectroscopic multi-parameter joint measurement, particularly in the infrared optical range, remains elusive. Here, we find an uncertain relation that constrains the precision of infrared spectroscopic multi-parameter measurements using entangled photon pairs. Under such a relation, we demonstrate a trade-off between the measurement precisions of the refractive index and absorption coefficient of the medium in the infrared range, and also illustrate how to balance their respective estimation errors. Our work shall provide guidance towards the future experimental designs and applications in entanglement-assisted spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Existence and Characterisation of Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jasper Johannes Postema, Servaas J.J.M.F. Kokkelmans</p>
            <p>Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code offers protection against decoherence and enhances the fidelity of qubits and gate operations. One of the holy grails of QEC is to construct codes with asymptotically good parameters, i.e. a non-vanishing rate and relative minimum distance. Such codes provide compact quantum memory with low overhead and enhanced error correcting capabilities, compared to state-of-the-art topological error correction codes such as the surface or colour codes. Finding good codes that can be implemented on near-term quantum hardware is among the key goals in the field of quantum computing. Recently, bivariate bicycle (BB) codes have emerged as a promising candidate for such compact memory, though the exact tradeoff of the code parameters remains unknown. In this Article, we explore these parameters by focusing on the subclass of coprime BB codes. In many cases, we can efficiently predict code parameters by leveraging the ring structure of these codes. Finally, we demonstrate asymptotic badness. Though this excludes this subclass of codes from the search towards practical good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, it does not affect the utility of the moderately long codes that are known, which can already be used to experimentally demonstrate better QEC beyond the surface code.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengyan Li, Yanning Jia, Fenzhuo Guo, Haifeng Dong, Sujuan Qin, Fei Gao</p>
            <p>Network quantum steering plays a pivotal role in quantum information science, enabling robust certification of quantum correlations in scenarios with asymmetric trust assumptions among network parties. Despite its significance, efficient methods for measuring network quantum steerability remain elusive. To tackle this issue, we develop a neural network-based method that can be generalized to arbitrary quantum networks, providing an effective framework for steerability analysis. Our method demonstrates remarkable accuracy and efficiency in single-source scenarios, specifically bipartite and multipartite steering scenarios, with numerical simulations involving isotropic states and noisy GHZ states showing consistent results with established findings. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility in the bilocal steering scenario, where an untrusted central party shares two-qubit isotropic states of different visibilities, $\nu$ and $\omega$, with trusted endpoint parties and performs a single Bell state measurement (BSM). Through explicit construction of network local hidden state (NLHS) model derived from numerical results and incorporation of the entanglement properties of network assemblages, we analytically demonstrate that the threshold for the existence of network steering is determined by the curve $\nu \omega = {1}/{3}$ under the corresponding configuration.</p>

            <h2>Strong tunable spin-spin coupling with cavity-magnon criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ma-Lei Peng, Miao Tian, Xue-Chun Chen, Guo-Qiang Zhang, Hai-Chao Li, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Strong long-distance spin-spin coupling is desperately demanded for solid-state quantum information processing, but it is still challenged. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system, consisting of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator weakly coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy spin in diamond and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) nanosphere holding Kerr magnons, to realize strong long-distance spin-spin coupling. With a strong driving field on magnons, the Kerr effect can squeeze magnons, and thus the coupling between the CPW resonator and the squeezed magnons is {\it exponentially enhanced}, which produces two cavity-magnon polaritons, i.e., the high-frequency polariton (HP) and low-frequency polariton (LP). When the enhanced cavity-magnon coupling approaches the critical value, the spin is fully decoupled from the HP, while the coupling between the spin and the LP is significantly improved. In the dispersive regime, a strong spin-spin coupling is achieved with accessible parameters. The coupling distance can be up to centimeter scale, limited by the cavity size. Our proposal provides a pave way to manipulate solid spins with cavity-magnon polaritons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Li, Jamir Marino, Darrick E. Chang, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>While traditionally regarded as an obstacle to quantum coherence, recent breakthroughs in quantum optics have shown that the dissipative interaction of a qubit with its environment can be leveraged to protect quantum states and synthesize many-body entanglement. Inspired by this progress, here we set the stage for the -- yet uncharted -- exploration of analogous cooperative phenomena in hybrid solid-state platforms. We develop a comprehensive formalism for the quantum many-body dynamics of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects interacting with the magnetic field fluctuations of a common solid-state reservoir. Our framework applies to any solid-state reservoir whose fluctuating spin, pseudospin, or charge degrees of freedom generate magnetic fields. To understand whether correlations induced by dissipative processes can play a relevant role in a realistic experimental setup, we apply our model to a qubit array interacting via the spin fluctuations of a ferromagnetic bath. Our results show that the low-temperature collective relaxation rates of the qubit ensemble can display clear signatures of super- and subradiance, i.e., forms of cooperative dynamics traditionally achieved in atomic ensembles. We find that the solid-state analog of these cooperative phenomena is robust against spatial disorder in the qubit ensemble and thermal fluctuations of the magnetic reservoir, providing a route for their feasibility in near-term experiments. Our work lays the foundation for a multi-qubit approach to quantum sensing of solid-state systems and the direct generation of many-body entanglement in spin-defect ensembles. Furthermore, we discuss how the tunability of solid-state reservoirs opens up novel pathways for exploring cooperative phenomena in regimes beyond the reach of conventional quantum optics setups.</p>

            <h2>Ground state energy and magnetization curve of a frustrated magnetic system from real-time evolution on a digital quantum processor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Szasz, Ed Younis, Wibe Albert de Jong</p>
            <p>Models of interacting many-body quantum systems that may realize new exotic phases of matter, notably quantum spin liquids, are challenging to study using even state-of-the-art classical methods such as tensor network simulations. Quantum computing provides a promising route for overcoming these difficulties to find ground states, dynamics, and more. In this paper, we argue that recently developed hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on real-time evolution are promising methods for solving a particularly important model in the search for spin liquids, the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional kagome lattice. We show how to construct efficient quantum circuits to implement time evolution for the model and to evaluate key observables on the quantum computer, and we argue that the method has favorable scaling with increasing system size. We then restrict to a 12-spin star plaquette from the kagome lattice and a related 8-spin system, and we give an empirical demonstration on these small systems that the hybrid algorithms can efficiently find the ground state energy and the magnetization curve. For these demonstrations, we use four levels of approximation: exact state vectors, exact state vectors with statistical noise from sampling, noisy classical emulators, and (for the 8-spin system only) real quantum hardware, specifically the Quantinuum H1-1 processor; for the noisy simulations and hardware demonstration, we also employ error mitigation strategies based on the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Our results strongly suggest that these hybrid algorithms present a promising direction for studying quantum spin liquids and more generally for resolving important unsolved problems in condensed matter theory and beyond.</p>

            <p>We analyze sharing Bell-type nonlocal correlation between two distant parties with optical hybrid states comprising a single photon polarization state and a multiphoton coherent state. By deploying entanglement swapping over the coherent state parts at the middle station, we show that the optical hybrid states can efficiently generate a polarization-entangled state that violates Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality well over a metropolitan distance. We further assess the quality of the shared entangled state in the information processing task of quantum teleportation of an unknown polarization qubit. Our results with realistic devices, embedding detection inefficiency and transmission losses, indicate the viability of faithful quantum teleportation over large distances, consistent with the quality of the shared correlation.</p>

            <p>In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</p>

            <p>Non-Gaussian quantum states of bosons are a key resource in quantum information science with applications ranging from quantum metrology to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Generation of photonic non-Gaussian resource states, such as Schrödinger's cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, is challenging. In this work, we extend on existing passive architectures and explore a broad set of adaptive schemes. Our numerical results demonstrate a consistent improvement in the probability of success and fidelity of generating these non-Gaussian quantum states with equivalent resources. We also explore the effect of loss as the primary limiting factor and observe that adaptive schemes lead to more desirable outcomes in terms of overall probability of success and loss tolerance. Our work offers a versatile framework for non-Gaussian resource state generation with the potential to guide future experimental implementations.</p>

In these notes, we review how anyon braiding and measurement in $S_3$ TO are primitives for topological quantum computation and we explicitly demonstrate universality. These topological operations are made concrete in the $S_3$ quantum double lattice model, aided by the introduction of a generalized ribbon operator.

            <p>We consider compositions of random bistochastic completely positive (bcp) maps driven by an ergodic dynamical system. Our main result is the explicit description of Oseledets's Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) for such compositions in terms of the random multiplicative domains corresponding to the random bcp maps in the compositions. By applying our main theorem, we classify when compositions of random bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, and use this classification to show that occasionally PPT maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, i.e., if compositions of random bcp maps contain PPT bcp maps with positive probability, then they are asymptotically entanglement breaking almost surely. We then strengthen our results in the case of compositions of i.i.d. random bcp maps, and, by an application of the theory of random walks on linear groups, we prove a generalization of a theorem of Kuperberg for compositions of i.i.d. random bcp maps. We conclude with a cursory discussion of how to use our methods to move beyond asymptotics and find random finite times at which compositions of random bcp maps are entanglement breaking.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Signature Validation Algorithm (QSVA) is introduced as a novel quantum-based approach designed to enhance the detection of tampered transactions in blockchain systems. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of quantum computing, especially within the framework of transaction-based blockchains, the QSVA aims to surpass classical methods in both speed and efficiency. By utilizing a quantum walk approach integrated with PageRank-based search algorithms, QSVA provides a robust mechanism for identifying fraudulent transactions. Our adaptation of the transaction graph representation efficiently verifies transactions by maintaining a current set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) characteristic of models like Bitcoin. The QSVA not only amplifies detection efficacy through a quadratic speedup but also incorporates two competing quantum search algorithms$-$Quantum SearchRank and Randomized SearchRank$-$to explore their effectiveness as foundational components. Our results indicate that Randomized SearchRank, in particular, outperforms its counterpart in aligning with transaction rankings based on the Classical PageRank algorithm, ensuring more consistent detection probabilities. These findings highlight the potential for quantum algorithms to revolutionize blockchain security by improving detection times to $O(\sqrt{N})$. Progress in Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) could facilitate future integration of quantum solutions into more general distributed systems. As quantum technology continues to evolve, the QSVA stands as a promising strategy offering significant advancements in blockchain efficiency and security.</p>

            <p>In the modular superconducting quantum processor architecture, high-fidelity, meter-scale microwave interconnect between processor modules is a key technology for extending system size beyond constraints imposed by device manufacturing equipment, yield, and signal delivery. While there have been many demonstrations of remote state transfer between modules, these relied on tomographic experiments for benchmarking, but this technique does not reliably separate State Preparation And Measurement (SPAM) error from error per state transfer. Recent developments based on randomized benchmarking provide a compatible theory for separating these two errors. In this work, we present a module-to-module interconnect based on Tunable-Coupling Qubits (TCQs) and benchmark, in a SPAM error tolerant manner, a remote state transfer fidelity of 0.988 across a 60cm long coplanar waveguide (CPW). The state transfer is implemented via superadiabatic transitionless driving method, which suppresses intermediate excitation in internal modes of CPW. We also introduce the frame tracking technique to correct unintended qubit phase rotations before and after the state transfers, which enables the SPAM-error-tolerant benchmarking of the state transfers. We further propose and construct a remote CNOT gate between modules, composed of local CZ gates in each module and remote state transfers, and report a high gate fidelity of 0.933 using randomized benchmarking method. The remote CNOT construction and benchmarking we present is a more complete metric that fully characterizes the module to module link operation going forward as it more closely represents interconnect operation in a circuit.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the primary goal of quantum thermodynamics -- to characterize quantum signatures and leverage their benefits in thermodynamic scenarios -- , we design a work extraction game within a bipartite framework that exhibits a quantum thermodynamic advantage. The steerability of quantum correlations between the two parties is the key resource enabling such an advantage. In designing the game, we exploit the correspondence between steerability and the incompatibility of observables. Our work extraction protocol involves mutually unbiased bases, which exhibit maximum incompatibility and therefore maximum steerability, showcased in maximally entangled quantum states. We derive upper bounds on the extractable work for unsteerable and steerable correlations and devise a protocol that saturates the latter. The ratio between the extractable work in steerable and unsteerable scenarios, which encapsulates the quantum advantage, increases with the dimension of the underlying system (sometimes referred to as an unbounded advantage). This proves a quantum thermodynamic advantage arising from steerable quantum correlations.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a promising solution to protect current cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computers. As QKD transitions from laboratories to real-world applications, its implementation under various environmental conditions has become a pressing challenge. Major obstacles to practical QKD implementation are the loss of photons in the transmission media and the presence of extreme noise, which can severely limit long-range transmission. In this paper, we investigate the impact of extreme noise on QKD system parameters, including detector timing uncertainty (jitter), measurement timing shifts, variations in detector deadtime, and rate-dependent detector efficiency. Contrary to manufacturers' specifications, which assume these parameters to be constant, we demonstrate that these parameters exhibit significant variations in extreme noise conditions. We show that changes in these parameters play a key role in determining system performance in noisy environments. To address these non-idealities, we develop a robust model that can address and adapt to various detector characteristics. In particular, our model is independent of source parameters and can be implemented using data from the detection unit. Our results show that our model is well suited for characterizing and optimizing the performance of the QKD system under noisy conditions.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate that a digitized counterdiabatic quantum protocol reduces the number of topological defects created during a fast quench across a quantum phase transition. To show this, we perform quantum simulations of one- and two-dimensional transverse-field Ising models driven from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. We utilize superconducting cloud-based quantum processors with up to 156 qubits. Our data reveal that the digitized counterdiabatic protocol reduces defect formation by up to 48% in the fast-quench regime -- an improvement hard to achieve through digitized quantum annealing under current noise levels. The experimental results closely match theoretical and numerical predictions at short evolution times, before deviating at longer times due to hardware noise. In one dimension, we derive an analytic solution for the defect number distribution in the fast-quench limit. For two-dimensional geometries, where analytical solutions are unknown and numerical simulations are challenging, we use advanced matrix-product-state methods. Our findings indicate a practical way to control the topological defect formation during fast quenches and highlight the utility of counterdiabatic protocols for quantum optimization and quantum simulation in material design on current quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Path-integral techniques are a powerful tool used in open quantum systems to provide an exact solution for the non-Markovian dynamics. However, the exponential tensor scaling with memory length of these techniques limits the applicability when applied to systems with long memory times.

This approach dramatically reduces both computational time and memory usage of the traditional tensor-multiplication schemes. Calculations that would require over 50 million GB of RAM in the original approach are now available on standard desktop computers, allowing access to new regimes and more complex systems. As a demonstration, we apply it to the Trotter decomposition with linked cluster expansion technique, and use it to investigate a quantum dot-microcavity system at larger coupling strengths than previously achieved. Secondly, we apply the optimization when the memory time is very long - specifically in a system containing two spatially separated quantum dots in a common phonon bath.</p>

            <p>The bin packing problem, a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenge, has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum computing applications. In this work, we address the one-dimensional bin packing problem (1dBPP) using a digitized counter-diabatic quantum algorithm (DC-QAOA), which incorporates counter-diabatic (CD) driving to reduce quantum resource requirements while maintaining high solution quality, outperforming traditional methods such as QAOA. We evaluate three ansatz schemes-DC-QAOA, a CD-inspired ansatz, and a CD-mixer ansatz-each integrating CD terms with distinct combinations of cost and mixer Hamiltonians, resulting in different DC-QAOA variants. Among these, the CD-mixer ansatz demonstrates superior performance, showing robustness across various iteration counts, layer depths, and Hamiltonian steps, while consistently producing the most accurate approximations to exact solutions. To validate our approach, we solve a 10-item 1dBPP instance on an IBM quantum computer, optimizing circuit structures through simulations. Despite constraints on circuit depth, the CD-mixer ansatz achieves high accuracy and a high likelihood of success. These findings establish DC-QAOA, particularly the CD-mixer variant, as a powerful framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Solving quadratic binary optimization problems using quantum SDP methods: Non-asymptotic running time analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Henze, Viet Tran, Birte Ostermann, Richard Kueng, Timo de Wolff, David Gross</p>
            <p>Quantum computers can solve semidefinite programs (SDPs) using resources that scale better than state-of-the-art classical methods as a function of the problem dimension. At the same time, the known quantum algorithms scale very unfavorably in the precision, which makes it non-trivial to find applications for which the quantum methods are well-suited. Arguably, precision is less crucial for SDP relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems (such as the Goemans-Williamson algorithm), because these include a final rounding step that maps SDP solutions to binary variables. With this in mind, Brandão, França, and Kueng have proposed to use quantum SDP solvers in order to achieve an end-to-end speed-up for obtaining approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. They did indeed succeed in identifying an algorithm that realizes a polynomial quantum advantage in terms of its asymptotic running time. However, asymptotic results say little about the problem sizes for which advantages manifest. Here, we present an analysis of the non-asymptotic resource requirements of this algorithm. The work consists of two parts. First, we optimize the original algorithm with a particular emphasis on performance for realistic problem instances. In particular, we formulate a version with adaptive step-sizes, an improved detection criterion for infeasible instances, and a more efficient rounding procedure. In a second step, we benchmark both the classical and the quantum version of the algorithm. The benchmarks did not identify a regime where even the optimized quantum algorithm would beat standard classical approaches for input sizes that can be realistically solved at all. In the absence of further significant improvements, these algorithms therefore fall into a category sometimes called galactic: Unbeaten in their asymptotic scaling behavior, but not practical for realistic problems.</p>

            <p>We propose a superconducting qubit based on engineering the first and second harmonics of the Josephson energy and phase relation $E_{J1}\cos \varphi$ and $E_{J2}\cos 2\varphi$. By constructing a circuit such that $E_{J2}$ is negative and $|E_{J1}| \ll |E_{J2}|$, we create a periodic potential with two non-degenerate minima. The qubit, which we dub "harmonium", is formed from the lowest-energy states of each minimum. Bit-flip protection of the qubit arises due to the localization of each qubit state to their respective minima, while phase-flip protection can be understood by considering the circuit within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We demonstrate with time-domain simulations that single- and two-qubit gates can be performed in approximately one hundred nanoseconds. Finally, we compute the qubit coherence times using numerical diagonalization of the complete circuit in conjunction with state-of-the-art noise models. We estimate out-of-manifold heating times on the order of milliseconds, which can be treated as erasure errors using conventional dispersive readout.

            <h2>Topological phases in two-dimensional Rydberg lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathias B. M. Svendsen, Beatriz Olmos</p>
            <p>Rydberg lattice gases are at the forefront of quantum simulation platforms due to their inherent strong dipole-dipole interactions, long life-times and high degree of control currently achievable in experiments. We propose a simple and experimentally realizable two-dimensional lattice model consisting of two offset square sublattices of Rydberg atoms for the simulation of a so-called two-dimensional SSH model. This model reveals a plethora of topological phases, all connected through the variation of the lattice geometry. We predict the appearance of edge and corner states characterizing topological insulators, as well as pairs of topologically charged Dirac points associated with tilted and anisotropic cones in gapless semimetallic phases. The position, tilt and degree of anisotropy of the cones, which may determine the transport porperties of the system, are tunable via the sublattice offset parameters.</p>

            <p>Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</p>

            <h2>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Sakamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</p>

            <h2>Interplay between dressed and strong-axial-field states in Nitrogen-Vacancy centers for quantum sensing and computation</h2>

            <p>The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an intriguing electronic spin system with applications in quantum radiometry, sensing and computation. In those experiments, a bias magnetic field is commonly applied along the NV symmetry axis to eliminate the triplet ground state manifold's degeneracy (S=1). In this configuration, the eigenvectors of the NV spin's projection along its axis are called strong-axial field states. Conversely, in some experiments a weak magnetic field is applied orthogonal to the NV symmetry axis, leading to eigenstates that are balanced linear superpositions of strong-axial field states, referred to as dressed states. The latter are sensitive to environmental magnetic noise at the second order, allowing to perform magnetic field protected measurements while providing increased coherence times. However, if a small axial magnetic field is added in this regime, the linear superposition of strong-axial field states becomes unbalanced. This paper presents a comprehensive study of Free Induction Decay (FID) measurements performed on a NV center ensemble in the presence of strain and weak orthogonal magnetic field, as a function of a small magnetic field applied along the NV symmetry axis. The simultaneous detection of dressed states and unbalanced superpositions of strong-axial field states in a single FID measurement is shown, gaining insight about coherence time, nuclear spin and the interplay between temperature and magnetic field sensitivity. The discussion concludes by describing how the simultaneous presence of magnetically-sensitive and -insensitive states opens up appealing possibilities for both sensing and quantum computation applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rasmus Vesterager Gothelf, Christian Saugbjerg Lange, Lars Bojer Madsen</p>
            <p>We study intraband high-harmonic generation (HHG) in a crystal driven by quantum light. Previous theoretical studies have developed a framework based on coherent state expansions in terms of P distributions to consider nonclassical driving fields for HHG in atoms. Here, we adapt this framework to the context of solids and consider an intraband model of ZnO. We investigate the effect of the quantum optical nature of the driving field on the harmonic spectra including the cutoff and the intensity scaling of the harmonics with driving field intensity. Based on analytical calculations in the Floquet limit, we explain why driving with thermal light or bright-squeezed vacuum (BSV) produces a much higher cutoff than when driving with fields described by coherent or Fock states. Further, we derive an expression for the generated time-dependent electric field and its fluctuations and find that it inherits characteristics of the driving field. Finally, we discuss the limitations of an approximative positive P representation, which is introduced to be able to reduce the numerical complexity for Fock and BSV driving fields.</p>

            <h2>The Observational Partial Order of Causal Structures with Latent Variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina Maciel Ansanelli, Elie Wolfe, Robert W. Spekkens</p>
            <p>For two causal structures with the same set of visible variables, one is said to observationally dominate the other if the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the first contains the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the second. Knowing such dominance relations is useful for adjudicating between these structures given observational data. We here consider the problem of determining the partial order of equivalence classes of causal structures with latent variables relative to observational dominance. We provide a complete characterization of the dominance order in the case of three visible variables, and a partial characterization in the case of four visible variables. Our techniques also help to identify which observational equivalence classes have a set of realizable distributions that is characterized by nontrivial inequality constraints, analogous to Bell inequalities and instrumental inequalities. We find evidence that as one increases the number of visible variables, the equivalence classes satisfying nontrivial inequality constraints become ubiquitous. (Because such classes are the ones for which there can be a difference in the distributions that are quantumly and classically realizable, this implies that the potential for quantum-classical gaps is also ubiquitous.) Furthermore, we find evidence that constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that rely solely on conditional independence constraints have a significantly weaker distinguishing power among observational equivalence classes than algorithms that go beyond these (i.e., algorithms that also leverage nested Markov constraints and inequality constraints).</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation is a rapidly evolving tool with great potential for research at the frontiers of physics, and is particularly suited to be used in computationally intensive lattice simulations, such as problems with non-equilibrium. In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter expansion, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift. This work also demonstrates the simplicity and convenience of using quantum simulations when studying time-evolution problems.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyuan Wang, Romain Vasseur, Simon Trebst, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional entanglement is a valuable resource for several quantum information processing tasks, and is often characterized by the Schmidt number and specific classes of entangled states beyond qubit-qubit and qubit-qutrit systems. We propose a criterion to detect high-dimensional entanglement, focusing on determining the Schmidt number of quantum states and identifying significant classes of PPT and NPT entangled states. Our approach relies on evaluating moments of generalized positive maps which can be efficiently simulated in real experiments without the requirement of full-state tomography. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection scheme through various illustrative examples. As a direct application, we explore the implications of our moment-based detection schemes in identifying useful quantum channels such as non-Schmidt number breaking channels and non-entanglement breaking channels. Finally, we present the operational implication of our proposed moment criterion through its manifestation in channel discrimination tasks.</p>

            <p>On-demand entangled photon pairs at telecom wavelengths are crucial for quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology. The O-band is particularly advantageous because of its minimal chromatic dispersion and transmission loss in optical fibers, making it well-suited for long-distance quantum networks. Site-controlled nanowire quantum dots have emerged as a promising platform for the on-demand generation of single and entangled photons, offering high extraction efficiency and the potential for scalable fabrication in large uniform arrays. However, their operation has been largely restricted to the visible and first near-infrared (NIR-I) windows. Here, we demonstrate an on-demand bright source of entangled photon pairs with high fidelity in the telecom O-band based on site-controlled nanowire quantum dots. We measure a fine-structure splitting of 4.6 $\mu$eV, verifying the suitability of the quantum dot for generating high-fidelity polarization-entangled photon pairs. Full quantum state tomography of the two-photon state generated by the biexciton\hyph exciton cascade reveals a maximum fidelity of $85.8\% \pm 1.1\%$ to the $\Phi^+$ Bell state, and a maximum concurrence of $75.1\% \pm 2.1\%$. We estimate the source efficiency at the first lens to be 12.5$\%$. This bright, scalable, and deterministic source of entangled photons in the telecom range represents a valuable step forward in advancing practical quantum applications at telecom wavelengths.</p>

            <p>Experimental deployment of quantum communication over Earth-satellite channels opens the way to a secure global quantum Internet. In this work, we present results from a real-time prototype quantum key distribution (QKD) system, which entails the development of optical systems including the encoding of entangled photon pairs, the development of transmitters for quantum signaling through an emulated Earth-satellite channel, and the development of quantum-decoding receivers. A unique aspect of our system is the integration of QKD with existing cryptographic methods to ensure quantum-resistant security, even at low-key rates. In addition, we report the use of specially designed error-reconciliation codes that optimize the security versus key-rate trade-off. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, a deployment of the BBM92 protocol that offers both post-quantum security via the advanced encryption standard (AES) and quantum security via an entanglement-based QKD protocol. If either the AES or the QKD is compromised through some adversary attack, our system still delivers state-of-the-art communications secure against future quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Euimin Lee, Sangmin Lee, Shiho Kim</p>
            <p>High-energy physics simulations traditionally rely on classical Monte Carlo methods to model complex particle interactions, often incurring significant computational costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum-enhanced simulation framework that integrates discrete-time quantum walks with quantum amplitude estimation to model photon interaction cross sections. By mapping the probabilistic transport process of 10 MeV photons in a water medium onto a quantum circuit and focusing on Compton scattering as the dominant attenuation mechanism, we demonstrate that our approach reproduces classical probability distributions with high fidelity. Simulation results obtained via the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator reveal a quadratic speedup in amplitude estimation compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods. Our framework not only validates the feasibility of employing quantum algorithms for high-energy physics simulations but also offers a scalable pathway toward incorporating multiple interaction channels and secondary particle production. These findings underscore the potential of quantum-enhanced methods to overcome the computational bottlenecks inherent in large-scale particle physics simulations.</p>

            <p>The realization of a global quantum network capable of supporting secure communication and other quantum information processing (QIP) tasks hinges on the ability to distribute high-fidelity entanglement across long distances while optimizing resource usage. This work describes a scalable approach for building large quantum networks by connecting quantum sub-networks using entanglement backbones as interconnections and a swapping based entanglement distribution protocol. Using a statistical model for parametrized quantum sub-networks we derive a set of equations whose solutions give the optimal values of average network parameters that meet threshold requirements for QIP tasks while minimizing resource cost functions. Our analysis extends to the scenario where multiple sub-networks must be interconnected simultaneously based on the formulation of a global resource cost function. The probability of successfully satisfying the parameter thresholds of a QIP task as a function of average parameters of the sub-networks for random network demands reveals a transition from zero to full satisfiability above critical network parameter values. Moreover, we find that the satisfiability transition can be smooth or discontinuous depending on the topology of the sub-networks. Our results present a pathway for calculating optimal resource requirements in quantum sub-networks interconnected to form the global quantum internet.</p>

            <p>Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme for realizing multi-qubit entangled W-state and non-local $CZ$ and $C_2Z$ gates via a cavity polariton blockade mechanism with a system of atomic qubits coupled to a common cavity mode. The polariton blockade is achieved by tuning the system, an $N-$qubit register, such that no two atoms are simultaneously excited to the qubit excited state, and there is an effective coupling only between the ground state and a singly-excited W state of the qubit register. The control step requires only an external drive of the cavity mode and a global qubit pulse and no individual qubit addressing. We analytically obtain the state preparation error for an $N-$qubit W state which scales as $\sqrt{(1-1/N)}/\sqrt{C}$ where $C$ is the single particle cooperativity. We additionally show the application of the polariton blockade mechanism in realizing a non-local $CZ$ and $C_2Z$ gate by using a different set of computational qubit states, and characterize the gate errors which scale as $\sim 1/\sqrt{C}$.</p>

            <p>While single-photon counting is routinely achieved in the optical domain, operational single microwave photon detectors (SMPDs) have only recently been demonstrated. SMPDs are critical for sensing weak signals from incoherent emitters, with applications ranging from the detection of individual electron spins and dark-matter candidates to advancements in hybrid quantum devices and superconducting quantum computing. These detectors offer a substantial advantage over quantum-limited amplification schemes by bypassing the standard quantum limit for power detection, therefore further reductions in their intrinsic noise are essential for advancing quantum sensing at microwave frequencies. Several SMPD designs utilize the state of a superconducting qubit to encode the detection of an itinerant photon, and rely on a non-destructive photon-qubit interaction. Here, we leverage this Quantum-Non-Demolition feature by repeatedly measuring the impinging photon with cascaded Four-Wave-Mixing processes and encoding the detection on several qubits. This cascaded detector mitigates the intrinsic local noise of individual qubits, achieving a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in intrinsic detector noise at the cost of halving the efficiency. We report an intrinsic sensitivity of $8(1)\times10^{-24}\text{W}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, with an operational sensitivity of $5.9(6)\times 10^{-23}\text{W}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ limited by thermal photons in the input line.</p>

            <p>High-purity multi-photon states are essential for photonic quantum computing. Among existing platforms, semiconductor quantum dots offer a promising route to scalable and deterministic multi-photon state generation. However, to fully realize their potential we require a suitable optical excitation method. Current approaches of multi-photon generation rely on active polarization-switching elements (e.g., electro-optic modulators, EOMs) to spatio-temporally demultiplex single photons. Yet, the achievable multi-photon rate is fundamentally limited by the switching speed of the EOM. Here, we introduce a fully passive demultiplexing technique that leverages a stimulated two-photon excitation process to achieve switching rates that are only limited by the quantum dot lifetime. We demonstrate this method by generating two-photon states from a single quantum dot without requiring any active switching elements. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of demultiplexing while shifting it to the excitation stage, enabling loss-free demultiplexing and effectively doubling the achievable multi-photon generation rate when combined with existing active demultiplexing techniques.</p>

            <p>Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time-bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1\% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenbo Sun, Adrian E. Rubio López, Zubin Jacob</p>
            <p>Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander DeRieux, Walid Saad</p>
            <p>Collaboration is a key challenge in distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments. Learning frameworks for these decentralized systems must weigh the benefits of explicit player coordination against the communication overhead and computational cost of sharing local observations and environmental data. Quantum computing has sparked a potential synergy between quantum entanglement and cooperation in multi-agent environments, which could enable more efficient distributed collaboration with minimal information sharing. This relationship is largely unexplored, however, as current state-of-the-art quantum MARL (QMARL) implementations rely on classical information sharing rather than entanglement over a quantum channel as a coordination medium. In contrast, in this paper, a novel framework dubbed entangled QMARL (eQMARL) is proposed. The proposed eQMARL is a distributed actor-critic framework that facilitates cooperation over a quantum channel and eliminates local observation sharing via a quantum entangled split critic. Introducing a quantum critic uniquely spread across the agents allows coupling of local observation encoders through entangled input qubits over a quantum channel, which requires no explicit sharing of local observations and reduces classical communication overhead. Further, agent policies are tuned through joint observation-value function estimation via joint quantum measurements, thereby reducing the centralized computational burden. Experimental results show that eQMARL with ${\Psi}^{+}$ entanglement converges to a cooperative strategy up to $17.8\%$ faster and with a higher overall score compared to split classical and fully centralized classical and quantum baselines. The results also show that eQMARL achieves this performance with a constant factor of $25$-times fewer centralized parameters compared to the split classical baseline.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lan Zhang, Yinfei Li, Ye-Chao Liu, Jiangwei Shang</p>
            <p>Entanglement plays an indispensable role in numerous quantum information and quantum computation tasks, underscoring the need for efficiently verifying entangled states. In recent years, quantum state verification has received increasing attention, yet the challenge of addressing noise effects in implementing this approach remains unsolved. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the performance of quantum state verification protocols in the presence of measurement noise. Based on the analysis, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided to uniquely identify the target state under noisy measurements. Moreover, we propose a symmetric hypothesis testing verification algorithm with noisy measurements. Subsequently, using a noisy nonadaptive verification strategy of GHZ and stabilizer states, the noise effects on the verification efficiency are illustrated. From both analytical and numerical perspectives, we demonstrate that the noisy verification protocol exhibits a negative quadratic relationship between the sample complexity and the infidelity. Our method can be easily applied to real experimental settings, thereby demonstrating its promising prospects.</p>

            <h2>Doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information: Properties and operational interpretation from strong converse exponent</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Burri</p>
            <p>In this paper, we deepen the study of properties of the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information, which is defined as the minimization of the sandwiched divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite state relative to any product state. In particular, we prove a novel duality relation for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$ by employing Sion's minimax theorem, and we prove additivity for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$. Previously, additivity was only known for $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$, but has been conjectured for $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{2},\infty]$. Furthermore, we show that the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$ attains operational meaning in the context of binary quantum state discrimination as it is linked to certain strong converse exponents.</p>

            <h2>Inhomogeneous adiabatic preparation of a quantum critical ground state in two dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ihor Sokolov, Francis A. Bayocboc Jr., Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga</p>
            <p>Adiabatic preparation of a critical ground state is hampered by the closing of its energy gap as the system size increases. However, this gap is directly relevant only for a uniform ramp, where a control parameter in the Hamiltonian is tuned uniformly in space towards the quantum critical point. Here, we consider inhomogeneous ramps in two dimensions: initially, the parameter is made critical at the center of a lattice, from where the critical region expands at a fixed velocity. In the 1D and 2D quantum Ising models, which have a well-defined speed of sound at the critical point, the ramp becomes adiabatic with a subsonic velocity. This subsonic ramp can prepare the critical state faster than a uniform one. Moreover, in both a model of $p$-wave paired 2D fermions and the Kitaev model, the critical dispersion is anisotropic -- linear with a nonzero velocity in one direction and quadratic in the other -- but the gap is still inversely proportional to the linear size of the critical region, with a coefficient proportional to the nonzero velocity. This suffices to make the inhomogeneous ramp adiabatic below a finite crossover velocity and superior to the homogeneous one.</p>

            <h2>A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel H. S. Aguiar, George E. A. Matsas</p>
            <p>One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a Heisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than a critical mass $M_{\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$) would be necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively. Our effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum particles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\rm C}$. The purity loss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient for quantum particles with $m \ll M_{\rm C}$ but very effective for those with $m \sim M_{\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would (easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with state-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future Stern-Gerlach-like experiment.</p>

            <h2>Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Activation During Open Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaya Takahashi, Jarosław K. Korbicz</p>
            <p>The fact that in the course of an open evolution there is, in a vast majority of cases, a creation of system-environment entanglement out of the initial coherences, has been known for many years. However, how much entanglement can be created under general assumptions has not been analyzed yet. In this work, we investigate system-environment entanglement generation under a broad and important class of interactions known as pure dephasing interactions. Using completely general initials states, we derive a series of bounds on the amount of the created entanglement, connecting it to the initial system coherences as well as to the decohrence strength, making quantitatively precise the statement that larger entanglement leads to more decoherence. Interestingly, we obtain lower bounds, certifying minimal amount of entanglement that can be produced. As an illustration, we apply our results to the spin-boson model, where a qubit interacts with a bosonic bath, showing time evolution of the entanglement and the Markovian/non-Markovian crossover. Our results help to better understand and quantify the complicated correlations, produced during an open evolution, which will hopefully lead to better/new decoherence mitigation techniques.</p>

            <h2>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity: Emergence of Gravity in an Infinitely Divisible Quantum Universe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Houri Ziaeepour</p>
            <p>$SU(\infty)-QGR$ is a foundationally quantum approach to cosmology and gravity. It assumes that the Hilbert space of the Universe as a whole represents the symmetry group $SU(\infty)$, and demonstrates this symmetry for Hilbert spaces of infinite number of subsystems, which randomly emerge and represent arbitrary finite rank {\it internal} symmetries. The aim of present work is in depth study of the foundation and properties of this model. We show that the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry manifests itself through the entanglement of each subsystem with the rest of the Universe. We demonstrate that the states of subsystems depend on a dimensionful parameter arising due to the breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A relative dynamics arises when an arbitrary subsystem is selected as a quantum clock with a time parameter. Thus, states of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters related to their $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and dynamics, plus discrete parameters characterizing their internal symmetries. We demonstrate the irrelevance of the geometry of this parameter space for observables. On the other hand, we use quantum speed limits to show that the perceived classical spacetime and its Lorentzian geometry emerge as an average path of subsystems in their Hilbert space. In this respect, $SU(\infty)-QGR$ fundamentally deviates from gauge-gravity duality models. Invariance under reparameterization restricts the action of subsystems dynamics to a Yang-Mills quantum field theory defined on the (3+1)-dimensional parameter space for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries. Consequently, $SU(\infty)-QGR$ is renormalizable, but predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Nonetheless, it is proved that when quantum gravity effects are not detectable, the dynamics is perceived as the Einstein-Hilbert action. We briefly discuss $SU(\infty)-QGR$ specific models for dark energy.</p>

            <h2>Large Language Models Can Help Mitigate Barren Plateaus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Zhuang, Chaowen Guan</p>
            <p>In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for various applications, yet their training is often hindered by barren plateaus (BPs), where gradient variance vanishes exponentially as the model size increases. To address this challenge, we propose a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven search framework, AdaInit, that iteratively searches for optimal initial parameters of QNNs to maximize gradient variance and therefore mitigate BPs. Unlike conventional one-time initialization methods, AdaInit dynamically refines QNN's initialization using LLMs with adaptive prompting. Theoretical analysis of the Expected Improvement (EI) proves a supremum for the search, ensuring this process can eventually identify the optimal initial parameter of the QNN. Extensive experiments across four public datasets demonstrate that AdaInit significantly enhances QNN's trainability compared to classic initialization methods, validating its effectiveness in mitigating BPs.</p>

            <h2>Conditional Mutual Information and Information-Theoretic Phases of Decohered Gibbs States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Zhang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>Classical and quantum Markov networks -- including Gibbs states of commuting local Hamiltonians -- are characterized by the vanishing of conditional mutual information (CMI) between spatially separated subsystems. Adding local dissipation to a Markov network turns it into a \emph{hidden Markov network}, in which CMI is not guaranteed to vanish even at long distances. The onset of long-range CMI corresponds to an information-theoretic mixed-state phase transition, with far-ranging implications for teleportation, decoding, and state compressions. Little is known, however, about the conditions under which dissipation can generate long-range CMI. In this work we provide the first rigorous results in this direction. We establish that CMI in high-temperature Gibbs states subject to local dissipation decays exponentially, (i) for classical Hamiltonians subject to arbitrary local transition matrices, and (ii) for commuting local Hamiltonians subject to unital channels that obey certain mild restrictions. Conversely, we show that low-temperature hidden Markov networks can sustain long-range CMI. Our results establish the existence of finite-temperature information-theoretic phase transitions even in models that have no finite-temperature thermodynamic phase transitions. We also show several applications in quantum information and many-body physics.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement and private information in many-body thermal states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel J. Garratt, Max McGinley</p>
            <p>Using concepts from quantum cryptography, we show how entanglement in many-body mixed states is reflected in standard correlation functions. Focusing on systems in thermal equilibrium with an environment, we ask whether the entanglement in the system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment. Since private keys cannot be generated using separable states, we can infer the presence of entanglement from the success of such protocols. We derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.</p>

Further, we show how this framework may be extended to efficiently generate $N-$body interactions between any subset $N$ of the ion qubits. Finally, we apply these techniques to encode the Quantum Fourier Transform using quadratically-fewer entangling operations, with quadratically smaller runtime, compared with traditional approaches.</p>

            <h2>Quantum noise spectroscopy by qudit spectators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clara Javaherian, Chris Ferrie</p>
            <p>Quantum noise spectroscopy is a well-known method for detecting environmental noise spectrum and has various applications in quantum sensing, quantum network design, and quantum computing. In this work, a protocol for quantum noise spectroscopy by qudit spectators (arbitrary d-level quantum systems) is presented for noises with stochastic and stationary Gaussian distributions. The protocol uses Weyl basis decomposition, consisting of generalized Pauli matrices, as the theoretical tool, and the Alvarez-Suter noise spectroscopy method, by which the qudit is being exposed to a series of pulse sequences, and the noise polyspectra is extracted by multiple measurements of an observable of the qudit. The formalism is further developed and simulated for three theoretical frameworks: The first two frameworks utilize a simplified Weyl basis and are capable of detecting Z-type dephasing noise. One is specifically modeled for a qutrit (d=3), and the second framework is designed for all qudits and has been tested through simulations of a ququad (d=4) and a quoct (d=8). The third framework employs the full Weyl basis, enabling it to identify all types of XYZ-dephasing noise. The simulations for this framework have been conducted for a quoct (d=8) implemented by the Antimony atom. The analytical protocol for noise spectroscopy that has been introduced transforms qudit systems into quantum spectators, and the presented simulations demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this noise spectroscopy protocol.</p>

            <h2>Relaxation Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wantao Wang, Shuo Liu, Jiaqiang Li, Shi-Xin Zhang, Shuai Yin</p>
            <p>Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) describes the nonanalytical change of the entanglement entropy resulting from the interplay between measurement and unitary evolution. In this paper, we investigate the relaxation critical dynamics near the MIPT for different initial states in a one-dimensional quantum circuit. Specifically, when the initial state is in the volume-law phase with vanishing measurement probability, we find that the half-chain entanglement entropy $S$ decays as $S\propto t^{-1}$ with the coefficients proportional to the size of the system in the short-time stage; In contrast, when the initial state is the product state, $S$ increases with time as $S\propto \ln{t}$, consistent with previous studies. Despite these contrasting behaviors, we develop a unified scaling form to describe these scaling behaviors for different initial states where the off-critical-point effects can also be incorporated. This framework offers significant advantages for experimental MIPT detection. Our novel scheme, leveraging relaxation dynamical scaling, drastically reduces post-selection overhead, and can eliminate it completely with trackable classical simulation.</p>

            <h2>Beam splitters as controlled-Z gate for hybrid state</h2>

            <p>We explore a scheme based on adding a nonlocal photon and subtracting some number of photons to entangle the initial single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) state with the photon state. In a realistic model of interaction of the SMSV state with the photonic state on a beam splitter (BS) with changeable transmissivity or reflectivity the hybrid entanglement is realized for any values of the squeezing of input SMSV state. Maximum hybrid entanglement is achieved at certain values of the squeezing and BS parameter, which can mean implementation of a two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ-) operation using the BS with the appropriate initialization of the input states. The success probability of the gate, taking into account multiphoton outcomes in the measuring mode of the BS, is more than 0.3. We also propose to use new continuous variable (CV) states of definite parity that could increase the success probability of generating maximal hybrid entanglement. We show sufficient robustness of the generated entanglement under photon number resolving detection with practical quantum efficiency.</p>

By employing optical tweezers, we demonstrate atom positioning with a precision well below the cavity wavelength, a crucial requirement for cavity-QED experiments in which maximum atom-cavity coupling strength is required. We leverage our control capabilities to assemble an array of up to seven atoms with an efficiency that exceeds previous probabilistic methods by 4 orders of magnitude. The atoms are subsequently transferred from the tweezer array to a two-dimensional intracavity optical lattice that offers enhanced coherence for spin qubits while maintaining strong atom confinement. Our system overcomes the efficiency limitations of previous probabilistic loading techniques of cavity-coupled atom arrays and opens the path to multiqubit quantum networks with atoms strongly coupled to optical cavities.</p>

            <p>The polarization tensor of graphene derived in the framework of the Dirac model using the methods of thermal quantum field theory in (2+1) dimensions is recast in a mathematically equivalent but more compact and convenient in computations form along the real frequency axis.

The advantages of the presented formalism are demonstrated on the example of nonequilibrium Casimir force in the configuration of two parallel graphene-coated dielectric plates one of which is either hotter or colder than the environment. This force is investigated as a function of temperature, the energy gap, and chemical potential of graphene coatings with account of the effects of spatial dispersion. Besides the thermodynamically nonequilibrium Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces, the obtained form of the polarization tensor can be useful for investigation of many diverse physical phenomena in graphene systems, such as surface plasmons, reflectances, electrical conductivity, radiation heat transfer, etc.</p>

            <p>Classical coupled harmonic oscillator models are capable of describing the optical and infrared response of nanophotonic systems where a cavity photon couples to dipolar matter excitations. The distinct forms of coupling adopted in these classical models leads to different results in the ultrastrong coupling regime. To clarify the specific classical model required to address particular configurations, we establish a connection between each oscillator model and the equivalent cavity Quantum Electrodynamics description. We show that the proper choice of coupled harmonic oscillator model depends on the presence or absence of the diamagnetic term in the quantum models, linked to whether transverse or longitudinal electromagnetic fields mediate the coupling. This analysis also shows how to exploit the classical oscillator models to extract measurable information of the optical response, as demonstrated in three canonical photonic systems, and to describe the opening of the Reststrahlen band in the bulk dispersion of phononic materials</p>

We focus on nuclear-physics applications and consider a qubit-efficient mapping on the lattice, which can efficiently represent the large volumes required for realistic scattering simulations. For the case of a contact interaction, we develop an algorithm for time evolution based on the Trotter approximation that scales logarithmically with the lattice size, and is combined with quantum phase estimation. We eventually focus on the nuclear two-body system and a typical response function relevant for electron scattering as an example. We also investigate ground-state preparation and examine the total circuit depth required for a realistic calculation and the hardware noise level required to interpret the signal.</p>

Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality.

            <p>We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.</p>

However, purely information-theoretic measures fail to capture the actual computational complexity involved in performing certain tasks. In this work, we rigorously address this issue within the realm of entanglement theory, a cornerstone of quantum information science. We consider two key figures of merit: the computational distillable entanglement and the computational entanglement cost, quantifying the optimal rate of entangled bits (ebits) that can be extracted from or used to dilute many identical copies of $n$-qubit bipartite pure states, using computationally efficient local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We demonstrate that computational entanglement measures diverge significantly from their information-theoretic counterparts. While the von Neumann entropy captures information-theoretic rates for pure-state transformations, we show that under computational constraints, the min-entropy instead governs optimal entanglement distillation. Meanwhile, efficient entanglement dilution incurs in a major cost, requiring maximal $(\tilde{\Omega}(n))$ ebits even for nearly unentangled states. Surprisingly, in the worst-case scenario, even if an efficient description of the state exists and is fully known, one gains no advantage over state-agnostic protocols. Our results establish a stark, maximal separation of $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ vs. $o(1)$ between computational and information-theoretic entanglement measures. Finally, our findings yield new sample-complexity bounds for measuring and testing the von Neumann entropy, fundamental limits on efficient state compression, and efficient LOCC tomography protocols.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Schrödinger equation for homodyne measurements of strongly correlated systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniket Patra, Felix Motzoi, Klaus Mølmer</p>
            <p>We derive a stochastic Schrödinger equation that describes the homodyne measurement record of a strongly interacting atomic system. We derive this equation for a general system, where we use the rotating wave approximation in the linear atom-light interaction part, and the resulting equation is expressed in terms of the atomic operators only. Weak measurements are theoretically described in terms of positive operator-valued measures. Among different weak measurement schemes, several earlier references studied the Gaussian quantum continuous measurement in detail. Here we consider a homodyne measurement setup. We then demonstrate that the derived equation for this setup in the appropriate limit is the same as the one obtained while performing a Gaussian quantum continuous measurement.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the intricate dynamical behavior of an optomechanical system consisting of an optical resonator that drives two mechanically coupled resonators via phase-dependent phonon hopping. Addressing previous limitations in comprehending the dynamics of such systems, we derive the system's semiclassical dynamical equations from the optomechanical Hamiltonian, resulting in a set of six first-order ordinary differential equations. We subsequently illustrate the emergence of novel dynamic behaviors and demonstrate their pertinence for the development of new devices. The system exhibits either two or no steady states, contingent upon the incident radiation, mechanical coupling rate, and frequency detuning. Our stability analysis indicates that the stability of these states is determined by the same factors. We identify complex dynamical behaviors, including monostable and bistable self-excited quasi-periodic characteristics, the coexistence of hidden oscillations, and chaotic dynamics, and we propose a method for their control. These findings bear significant implications for applications in ultra-sensitive sensing, chaos-based communication, and tunable phononic circuits. This study enhances the broader understanding of complex dynamical systems in optomechanics, paving the way for the development of advanced optomechanical devices with controlled dynamics for stable and reliable operation.</p>

            <p>One-way quantum computation is a promising approach to achieving universal, scalable, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, a main challenge lies in the creation of universal, scalable three-dimensional cluster states. Here, an experimental scheme is proposed for building large-scale canonical three-dimensional cubic cluster states, which are compatible with the majority of qubit error-correcting codes, using the spatiospectral modes of an optical parametric oscillator. Combining with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, one-way fault-tolerant optical quantum computation can be achieved with a lower fault-tolerant squeezing threshold. Our scheme drastically simplify experimental configurations, paving the way for compact realizations of one-way fault-tolerant optical quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Witnessing the quantum nature of spacetime is an exceptionally challenging task. However, the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of matter (QGEM) protocol proposes such a test by testing entanglement between adjacent matter-wave interferometers. One key obstacle to experimentally realising this protocol is the creation of a spatial quantum superposition with heavy masses. Initially, it was envisaged that the superposition size would have to be of order 200 micron for a mass $10^{-14}$ kg (to obtain the entanglement phase of order unity when the centre of mass of the two interferometers are at a separation of 450 microns). The experimental design has since improved, e.g. by assuming that the two interferometers are separated by an electromagnetic screen, which helps bring the separation distance close to 35 micron. Here, we do parameter scans taking into account the electromagnetic screening, and we consider different geometrical setups; we show superpositions of at least a micron-size for mass $10^{-14}$ kg with a decoherence rate of order $10^{-3}$ Hz are required.</p>

            <p>Photon polarization serves as an essential quantum information carrier in quantum information and measurement applications. Routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and polarization-entangled photons is a crucial technology for scaling up quantum information applications. Here, we demonstrate a low-loss, noiseless, polarization-maintaining routing of single and entangled photons at the telecom L-band. Our interferometer-based router is constructed by optics with a low angle of incidence and cross-aligned electro-optic crystals, achieving the polarization-maintaining operation without additional polarization-compensation optics. We demonstrate the routing of arbitrary-polarized heralded single photons with a 1.3% loss, a $>$ 22 dB switching extinction ratio, and $>$ 99% polarization process fidelity to ideal identity operation. Moreover, the high-quality router achieves the routing of two-photon N00N-type entangled states with a highly maintained interference visibility of $\sim$ 97%. The demonstrated router scheme paves the way toward polarization-encoded photonic quantum network as well as multi-photon entanglement synthesis via spatial- and time-multiplexing techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Wei Ying, Qi Zhang, Shi-Pu Gu, Xing-Fu Wang, Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng</p>
            <p>The fully passive source is capable of passively generating decoy states and performing passive encoding simultaneously, avoiding the side-channel risks caused by active modulation operations at the source end, thus effectively enhance the security in quantum key distribution (QKD). Existing fully passive QKD protocol and experiments exploit phase-randomized coherent pulses. In this paper, we propose a fully passive QKD protocol using parametric down-conversion source. The decoy state generation and encoding operation can be carried out passively by parameter down-conversion progress. This protocol has several advantages. First, it can also eliminate all side channels in active modulators. Second, compared with fully passive QKD protocol with phase-randomized coherent pulses, our protocol can significantly increase the key rate and extend the communication distance. Meanwhile, in terms of the transmission rate, our protocol is also closer to that of actively modulated QKD and can achieve fully passive modulation with fewer resources. Moreover, combined with measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD, this protocol can even potentially achieve robustness against side channels in both detectors and modulators.</p>

            <p>We address the problem of routing quantum and classical information from one sender to many possible receivers in a network. By employing the formalism of quantum walks, we describe the dynamics on a discrete structure based on a complete graph, where the sites naturally provide a basis for encoding the quantum state to be transmitted. Upon tuning a single phase or weight in the Hamiltonian, we achieve near-unitary routing fidelity, enabling the selective delivery of information to designated receivers for both classical and quantum data. The structure is inherently scalable, accommodating an arbitrary number of receivers. The routing time is largely independent of the network dimension and input state, and the routing performance is robust under static and dynamic noise, at least for short time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Yao, X. Q. Shao</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries, as highly efficient energy storage devices, have garnered significant research interest. A key challenge in their development is maximizing the extractable energy (ergotropy) when operating within a finite-temperature reservoir. To address this, we applied quantum feedback control to the charger and investigated the effects of fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored energy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system exhibits optimal charging parameters. Notably, in a fermionic thermal reservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery performance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a bosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and extraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency. Additionally, we explored the impact of battery size and found that, under a fermionic reservoir, increasing the battery size appropriately can further improve performance.</p>

            <p>The non-cloning theorem of quantum states provides security, but also limits the Secret Key Rate (SKR) for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) implementations. Multiplexing is a widely used technique to enhance data rates in classical communication systems and can also increase the SKR in QKD systems. Using linearly polarized (LP) modes is an attractive solution as it is compatible with simple fiber designs. This work demonstrates a fiber-based QKD system employing LP mode multiplexing with a photonic lantern to convert the fundamental mode ($LP_{01}$) in separate fibers into higher-order modes ($LP_{11}$) in a single few-mode fiber. The performance of the system is sensitive to polarization dependence, mode alignment, and environmental crosstalk, which requires precise polarization control to minimize Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER). We report a SKR of 2.34 Mbps over a 24 km 5dB loss fiber link.</p>

            <p>Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a single layer placed in the middle of the optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation in the cavity quantization direction. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multilayered materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a {\it bright layer} description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayer material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</p>

            <p>Spectrometers based on high-finesse optical cavities have proven to be powerful tools for applied and fundamental studies. Extending this technology to the deep cryogenic regime is beneficial in many ways: Doppler broadening is reduced, peak absorption is enhanced, the Boltzmann distribution of rotational states is narrowed, all unwanted molecular species disturbing the spectra are frozen out, and dense spectra of complex polyatomic molecules become easier to assign. We demonstrate a cavity-enhanced spectrometer fully operating in the deep cryogenic regime down to 4 K. We solved several technological challenges that allowed us to uniformly cool not only the sample but also the entire cavity, including the mirrors and cavity length actuator, which ensures the thermodynamic equilibrium of a gas sample. Our technology well isolates the cavity from external noise and cryocooler vibrations. This instrument enables a variety of fundamental and practical applications. We demonstrate a few examples based on accurate spectroscopy of cryogenic hydrogen molecules: accurate test of the quantum electrodynamics for molecules; realization of the primary SI standards for temperature, concentration and pressure in the deep cryogenic regime; measurement of the H$_{2}$ phase diagram; and determination of the ortho-para spin isomer conversion rate.</p>

            <p>Neutral atom array has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computation due to its high-fidelity two-qubit gate, arbitrary connectivity and remarkable scalability. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atom necessitates careful consideration of the errors inherent to these systems. One typical error is the leakage from Rydberg states during the implementation of multi-qubit gates, which induces two-qubit error chain and degrades the error distance. To address this, researchers have proposed an erasure conversion protocol that employs fast leakage detection and continuous atomic replacement to convert leakage errors into benign erasure errors. While this method achieves a favorable error distance de = d, its applicability is restricted to certain atom species. In this work, we present a novel approach to manage Rydberg leakage errors in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). From a hardware perspective, we utilize practical experimental techniques along with an adaptation of the Pauli twirling approximation (PTA) to mitigate the impacts of leakage errors, which propagate similarly to Pauli errors without degrading the error distance. From a decoding perspective, we leverage the inherent structure of topological cluster states and final leakage detection information to locate propagated errors from Rydberg leakage. This approach eliminates the need for mid-circuit leakage detection, while maintaining an error distance de = d and achieving a high threshold of 3.4% per CZ gate for pure leakage errors under perfect final leakage detection. Furthermore, in the presence of additional Pauli errors, our protocol demonstrates comparable logical error rates to the erasure conversion method within a reasonable range of physical errors.</p>

At ~10 mK temperatures, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have exhibited exceptionally long coherence times and high operation fidelities. To advance this platform towards a scalable quantum information architecture, systematic characterization of its noise feature is imperative. Here, we show the remarkable resilience of solid neon against charge and thermal noises when eNe qubits are operated away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimizing neon growth, the measured charge (voltage) noise on solid neon is already orders of magnitude lower than that in most stringently grown semiconductors, rivaling the best records to date. Up to 400 mK, the eNe charge qubits operated at ~5 GHz can maintain their echo coherence times over 1 microsecond. These observations highlight solid neon as an ideal host for quantum information processing at higher temperatures and larger scales.</p>

Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and opens new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</p>

            <p>We investigate the steady-state optical response of a Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity system integrated with cold atoms featuring a double-$\Lambda$ energy level structure. Within this hybrid system, the atoms are driven by cavity mode and three coherent vortex beams, each carrying independent orbital angular momentum (OAM). We first check the steady-state output spectrum of the hybrid system in the passive/active case (without/with external cavity driving). Our findings reveal that the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) spectrum is modulated by the OAM difference $(\Delta \ell\hbar)$ from the atomic component throughout the four-wave mixing (FWM) process. The resulting loop phase ($\Delta \ell\theta$) can achieve a switching effect on the absorption and gain behavior of the hybrid system for the probe beam. Additionally, the group delay, indicative of fast/slow light phenomena, is also tuned by $\Delta \ell$. We further display how the atomic OAM modulates the periodicity of the output spot pattern in the hybrid system. This research provides valuable insights into the modulation of optical responses in Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate superradiant quantum phase transitions in a Dicke trimer model consisting of two types of hoppings, i.e., photon hoppings and atom hoppings. In the superradiant regime, the system can exist in two distinct phases: normal and frustrated superradiant phases, which are governed by both types of hoppings. Particularly, the interplay between these hoppings gives rise to interesting effects, such as triggering superradiance with much lower coupling strengths when both hoppings exhibit the same tendency. In contrast, with opposite tendencies, the competition between hoppings leads to a first-order phase transition between two different superradiant phases with translational symmetry broken. These findings enable the system to undergo a sequence of transitions across three phases by changing the coupling strength. Our work provides deep insights into competing interactions and quantum phase transitions in multi-cavity systems with geometric structures.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in polaritonic chemistry suggest that chemical reactions can be controlled via collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in a cavity. We provide an analytical framework for the dynamics of a molecular ensemble under VSC, revealing that strong collective coupling induces a collective beating, with a period inversely proportional to the collective vacuum Rabi splitting. This emergent beating period occurs over significantly longer time scales than either the individual molecular vibration or cavity field oscillation period, and peaks at the cavity-molecule resonance, consistent with polaritonic chemistry experiments. Most importantly, the collective beating is imprinted on the local dynamics and resonantly suppresses individual molecular vibrations when the molecules are vibrationally excited, as in activated complexes, formed in chemical reactions. The cavity mediates an energy exchange between the excited and the ground-state molecules, affecting the dynamics of the whole ensemble. In the ultrastrong coupling regime, we find that the local vibrations are modified by the cavity even at short time scales. Our analytical model offers insights into how collective VSC can resonantly dampen local molecular vibrations in the collective regime, potentially altering chemical reactivity.</p>

We investigate the effect of the quantum optical nature of the driving field on the harmonic spectra including the cutoff and the intensity scaling of the harmonics with driving field intensity. Based on analytical calculations in the Floquet limit, we explain why driving with thermal light or bright-squeezed vacuum (BSV) produces a much higher cutoff than when driving with fields described by coherent or Fock states. Further, we derive an expression for the generated time-dependent electric field and its fluctuations and find that it inherits characteristics of the driving field. Finally, we discuss the limitations of an approximative positive P representation, which is introduced to be able to reduce the numerical complexity for Fock and BSV driving fields.</p>

            <p>We propose a new mechanism to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation from a microwave field to a solid-state magnon mode. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</p>

            <h2>Tensor-network toolbox for probing dynamics of non-Abelian gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil Mathew, Navya Gupta, Saurabh V. Kadam, Aniruddha Bapat, Jesse Stryker, Zohreh Davoudi, Indrakshi Raychowdhury</p>
            <p>Tensor-network methods enable probing dynamics of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories, via Hamiltonian simulation, hence bypassing sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron formulation. This formulation has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to both SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups, to periodic and open boundary conditions, and to 1+1 and higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in computing static and dynamical observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1)D, pushing the boundary of existing studies.</p>

            <h2>Graph-Theoretic Analysis of $n$-Replica Time Evolution in the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingfei Li, Cheng Peng, Jianghui Yu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the $n$-replica time evolution operator $\mathcal{U}_n(t)\equiv e^{\mathcal{L}_nt} $ for the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (BGUE) using a graph-theoretic approach. We examine the moments of the generating operator $\mathcal{L}_n$, which governs the Euclidean time evolution within an auxiliary $D^{2n}$-dimensional Hilbert space, where $D$ represents the dimension of the Hilbert space for the original system. Explicit representations for the cases of $n = 2$ and $n = 3$ are derived, emphasizing the role of graph categorization in simplifying calculations. Furthermore, we present a general approach to streamline the calculation of time evolution for arbitrary $n$, supported by a detailed example of $n = 4$. Our results demonstrate that the $n$-replica framework not only facilitates the evaluation of various observables but also provides valuable insights into the relationship between Brownian disordered systems and quantum information theory.</p>

            <h2>Variational quantum thermalizers based on weakly-symmetric nonunitary multi-qubit operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elias Zapusek, Kristina Kirova, Walter Hahn, Michael Marthaler, Florentin Reiter</p>
            <p>We propose incorporating multi-qubit nonunitary operations in Variational Quantum Thermalizers (VQTs). VQTs are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that generate the thermal (Gibbs) state of a given Hamiltonian, with applications in quantum algorithms and simulations. However, current algorithms struggle at intermediate temperatures, where the target state is nonpure but exhibits entanglement. We devise multi-qubit nonunitary operations that harness weak symmetries and thereby improve the performance of the algorithm. Utilizing dissipation engineering, we create these nonunitary multi-qubit operations without the need for measurements or additional qubits. To train the ansatz, we develop and benchmark novel methods for entropy estimation of quantum states, expanding the toolbox for quantum state characterization. We demonstrate that our approach can prepare thermal states of paradigmatic spin models at all temperatures. Our work thus creates new opportunities for simulating open quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Floquet Engineering and Harnessing Giant Atoms in Frequency-Comb Emission and Bichromatic Correlations in Waveguide QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Yang Qiu, Li-Li Zheng, Ying Wu, Xin-You Lu</p>
            <p>The capability to design spectrally controlled photon emission is not only fundamentally interesting for understanding frequency-encoded light-matter interactions, but also is essential for realizing the preparation and manipulation of quantum states. Here we consider a dynamically modulated qubit array, and realize frequency-controlled single-photon emission focusing on the generation of a frequency comb constituted solely of even-parity or anti-Stokes sidebands. Our system also offers parity-dependent bunching and antibunching in frequency-filtered quantum correlations. In particular, the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup is extended to include chiral and non-local coupling architectures, thereby enhancing its versatility in Floquet engineering. Our proposal also supports the predictable generation of high-dimensional entangled quantum states, where the corresponding effective Hilbert space dimension is well controlled by energy modulation. Moreover, the utilisation of sophisticated numerical tools, such as the matrix product states (MPSs) and the discretization approach, enables the efficient simulation of multi-photon dynamics, in which the non-Markovian Floquet steady states emerge. This work fundamentally broadens the fields of collective emission, and has wide applications in implementing frequency-encoded quantum information processing and many-body quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Long-Lived Photon Blockade with Weak Optical Nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> You Wang, Xu Zheng, Timothy C. H. Liew, Y. D. Chong</p>
            <p>In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</p>

            <p>Entangling power is crucial for quantum information processing. This study examines the Anti-Jaynes-Cummings Model (AJCM) in generating quantum correlations between two atoms interacting via the Ising model and its effect on the entangled system. The AJCM is shown to create entanglement suitable as a quantum channel for information encoding. Interaction parameters act as controls to enhance quantum correlations, increase the capacity of the final atomic state, and improve system efficiency. When the atomic system starts in a maximally entangled state, increasing interaction strength and mean photon number further boosts concurrence and channel capacity.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal routing induced by chirality in an atom-dimer waveguide-QED system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Yu Liu, Lin-Lin Jiang, Hai-Zhu, Jie-Qiao Liao, Jin-Feng Huang</p>
            <p>The implementation of quantum routers is an important and desired task in quantum information science, since quantum routers are important components of quantum networks. Here, we propose a scheme for implementing single-photon routers in a waveguide-QED system, which consists of two coupled two-level atoms coupled to two waveguides to form a four-port quantum device. We obtain the exact analytical expressions of the single-photon scattering amplitudes using the real-space method. By taking the propagating time of photons between two coupling points into account or not, we consider the system working in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, respectively. In addition, we introduce the chiral coupling, which breaks the symmetry of the waveguide model, to manipulate the transmission of single photons. We find that when the system works in the non-Markovian regime, the single photon can be transmitted on demand by adjusting the asymmetry coefficient. More interestingly, the complete single-photon routing in this device does not require an ideal chiral coupling, loosening the photon transport conditions. This work will motivate the studies concerning the nonreciprocal and chiral quantum devices in the waveguide-QED platform.</p>

            <h2>Precise Quantum Control of Molecular Rotation Toward a Desired Orientation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian-Qian Hong, Daoyi Dong, Niels E. Henriksen, Franco Nori, Jun He, and Chuan-Cun Shu</p>
            <p>The lack of a direct map between control fields and desired control objectives poses a significant challenge in applying quantum control theory to quantum technologies. Here, we propose an analytical framework to precisely control a limited set of quantum states and construct desired coherent superpositions using a well-designed laser pulse sequence with optimal amplitudes, phases, and delays. This theoretical framework that corresponds to a multi-level pulse-area theorem establishes a straightforward mapping between the control parameters of the pulse sequence and the amplitudes and phases of rotational states within a specific subspace. As an example, we utilize this approach to generate 15 distinct and desired rotational superpositions of ultracold polar molecules, leading to 15 desired field-free molecular orientations. By optimizing the superposition of the lowest 16 rotational states, we demonstrate that this approach can achieve a maximum orientation value of $|\langle\cos\theta\rangle|_{\rm{max}}$ above 0.99, which is very close to the global optimal value of 1 that could be achieved in an infinite-dimensional state space. This work marks a significant advancement in achieving precise control over multi-level subsystems within molecules. It holds potential applications in molecular alignment and orientation, as well as in various interdisciplinary fields related to the precise quantum control of ultracold polar molecules, opening up considerable opportunities in molecular-based quantum techniques.</p>

            <h2>Investigation of intrinsic nonlinear effects in driven-dissipative optomechanical systems using the generalized linear response theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Askari, A. Dalafi, M. J. Kazemi</p>
            <p>In this article, we study the effects of intrinsic nonlinear optomechanical interaction on the linear response of a driven-dissipative optomechanical system to a weak time-dependent perturbation. By calculating the linear response of the cavity optical mode to a weak probe laser in the framework of the generalized linear response theory, it is shown how the Stokes and anti-Stokes sideband amplitudes as well as the power reflection coefficient, and the density of states of the cavity optical mode are expressed in terms of photonic retarded Green's functions. Then, we derive the equations of motion of retarded Green's functions of the system from nonlinear quantum Langevin equations and solve them. It is shown that for a single-photon optomechanical coupling of the order of the cavity linewidth, the nonlinear effect does not manifest itself unless the system satisfies a resonance condition, where the frequency of the upper normal mode of the system is twice that of the lower one. Based on the generality of the present approach which works at all regimes, the validity of linearization approximation is also confirmed at the off-resonance regime.</p>

            <p>While quantum measurements have been shown to constitute a resource for operating quantum thermal machines, the nature of the energy exchanges involved in the interaction between system and measurement apparatus is still under debate. In this work, we show that a microscopic model of the apparatus is necessary to unambiguously determine whether quantum measurements provide energy in the form of heat or work. We illustrate this result by considering a measurement-based refrigerator, made of a double quantum dot embedded in a two-terminal device, with the charge of one of the dots being continuously monitored. Tuning the parameters of the measurement device interpolates between a heat- and a work-fueled regimes with very different thermodynamic efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate a trade-off between a maximal thermodynamic efficiency when the measurement-based refrigerator is fueled by heat and a maximal measurement efficiency quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio in the work-fueled regime. Our analysis offers a new perspective on the nature of the energy exchanges occurring during a quantum measurement, paving the way for energy optimization in quantum protocols and quantum machines.</p>

Our model reveals that ionization enhancement and suppression by several orders of magnitude are still possible, however only in more extreme parameter regimes. Our approach allows the integration of many-body physics into intense laser dynamics with minimal computational and mathematical complexity, thus facilitating the identification of novel effects in strong-field physics and attosecond {science}.</p>

            <p>Europium-doped nanocrystals constitute a promising material for a scalable future quantum computing platform. Long-lived nuclear spin states could serve as qubits addressed via coherent optical transitions. In order to realize an efficient spin-photon interface, we couple the emission from a single nanoparticle to a fiber-based microcavity under cryogenic conditions. The spatial and spectral tunability of the cavity permits us to place individual nanoparticles in the cavity, to measure the inhomogeneous linewidth of the ions, and to show a multi-modal Purcell-enhancement of two transition in Eu$^{\text{3+}}$. A halving of the free-space lifetime to 1.0 ms is observed, corresponding to a 140-fold enhancement of the respective transition. Furthermore, we observe a narrow optical linewidth of 3.3 MHz for a few-ion ensemble in the center of the inhomogeneous line.

            <p>Ion trap system is a leading candidate for quantum network privileged by its long coherence time, high-fidelity gate operations, and the ion-photon entanglement that generates an ideal pair of a stationary memory qubit and a flying communication qubit. Rapid developments in nonlinear quantum frequency conversion techniques have enhanced the potential for constructing a trapped ion quantum network via optical fiber connections. The generation of long-distance entanglement has been demonstrated with ions such as Ca$^{+}$ and Ba$^{+}$, which emit photons in visible or near-infrared range naturally. On the other hand, as the qubit-native photons reside in ultra-violet (UV) spectrum, the Yb$^{+}$ ion has not been considered as a strong competitor for telecommunication qubits despite extensive research on it. Here, we demonstrate an efficient difference-frequency conversion of UV photons, emitted from a trapped Yb$^{+}$ ion, into a visible range. We provide experimental evidence that confirms the converted photons are radiated from the Yb$^{+}$ ion.

Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete.

For pure-loss bosonic channels, we derive analytical solutions of the optimal encoding and decoding modes for Lorentzian and box transmission spectra, along with numerical solutions for various other transmissions. Our findings reveal a general feature of sequential activation of quantum channels as the input signal duration increases, as well as the existence of optimal signal length for scenarios where only a limited number of channels are in use.</p>

            <p>Generating logical qubits, essential for error detection and correction in quantum computation, remains a critical challenge in continuous-variable (CV) optical quantum information processing. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a leading candidate for logical qubits, and its generation requires large-amplitude coherent state superpositions -- Schrödinger cat states. However, experimentally producing these resource states has been hindered in the optical domain by technical challenges. The photon subtraction method, a standard approach for generating cat states using a squeezed vacuum and a photon number-resolving detector, has proven difficult to scale to multi-photon operations. While the amplitude of the generated cat states increases with the number of subtracted photons, limitations in the generation rate have restricted the maximum photon subtraction to $n=3$ for over a decade. In this work, we demonstrate high-rate photon subtraction of up to four photons from a squeezed vacuum with picosecond wavepackets generated by a broadband optical parametric amplifier. Using a Ti-Au superconducting-transition-edge sensor, we achieve high-speed, high-resolution photon number discrimination. The resulting states exhibit Wigner function negativity without loss correction, and their quantum coherence is verified through off-diagonal density matrix elements in CV representation. These results overcome long-standing limitations in multi-photon operations, providing a critical foundation for generating quantum resources essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing and advancing ultrafast optical quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing with light is a promising approach to achieving large-scale quantum computation. While Gaussian operations on optical states have been successfully scaled, the generation of highly non-Gaussian states remains a critical challenge for achieving universality and fault-tolerance. However, due to the inherently weak nonlinearity in optics, creating non-Gaussian states remains challenging. A promising solution is to ``breed'' non-Gaussianity by combining multiple weakly non-Gaussian states using quantum memory systems. Here, we propose and demonstrate a scalable method for generating optical non-Gaussian states using a cavity-based quantum memory operating in continuous time. Our memory features dual-mode operation, enabling efficient switching between memory and entangling functionalities, allowing state generation and processing with minimal resources. By employing a time-domain-multiplexed breeding protocol, we successfully generated Wigner-negative states, a key requirement for quantum error correction. This work also marks the first full demonstration of continuous-time cavity-based quantum memory, encompassing the complete processes of writing, storage, and readout. These results represent a significant advancement in quantum information processing with light, providing a scalable method for generating complex non-Gaussian states essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Sun, Tao Shi, Ying Hu</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian topology has revolutionized our understanding of energy gaps and band topology, unveiling phases that do not exist within the Hermitian framework. Nonetheless, its fundamental implications for quantum interactions in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a novel interaction mechanism by examining a quantum-optical system where quantum emitters interact through the photonic band-gap of a dissipative photon bath with periodic boundaries, described by a nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Although localized photons within the gap should inhibit interactions between emitters in certain regimes, we find that long-range interactions emerge, defying conventional expectations. These anomalous interactions are mediated by a ``mirage bath" - a virtual bath that unfolds onto a distinct layer of the Riemann surface. This mirage bath generates emitter dynamics identical to those produced by the physical bath but possesses distinct band topology. Crucially, the interactions inherit the topology of the mirage bath, not the physical one. This bath duality is inherent to any dissipative bath with spectral topology, leading to a fundamentally new mechanism for long-range interactions and correlations across the multi-layered Riemann surface, unseen in traditional settings. Our findings open new avenues in quantum optics, many-body quantum simulations, and offer fresh insights into non-Hermitian topology.</p>

            <p>Biphotons from spontaneous parametric down conversion with broad bandwidth are highly wanted in many quantum technologies. However, achieving broad bandwidth in both frequency and momentum while keeping a high rate remains a challenge for both conventional nonlinear crystals and recently emerging nonlinear metasurfaces. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a periodically poled triple-resonance metasurface (PPTM) incorporating a nano-grating atop a periodically poled LiNbO$_3$ thin film. PPTM supports high-Q guided mode resonances at pump, signal, and idler wavelengths meanwhile enabling quasi-phase matching between three guided modes in a broad frequency/momentum range. The predicted biphoton rate is over 100 MHz/mW with a frequency bandwidth of 165 nm around 1550 nm and a momentum bandwidth of $13^\circ \times 6^\circ$, improving the state-of-the-art by over three orders of magnitude in rate and one order of magnitude in bandwidths. This ultrathin broadband bright biphoton source could stimulate system-level miniaturization of various free-space quantum photonic technologies.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions formed in semiconductor nanowires host Andreev bound states and serve as a physical platform to realize Andreev qubits tuned by electrostatic gating. With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of an InAs nanowire weak link embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy of spin-degenerate and spin-orbit split Andreev bound states for the shorter and longer weak links, respectively. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which results in a measured coupling strength reaching 1.95 GHz to the Andreev level and 77 MHz to the Andreev spin. Our spectroscopic data are in good agreement with existing theoretical models and demonstrate ultrastrong coupling to the Andreev pair qubit with the coupling strength approaching the bare resonator and qubit frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Tunable photon scattering by an atom dimer coupled to a band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Zhu Song, Lin-Xiong Wang, Jing-Xue Zhang, Hai-Rui Wei</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters trapped near photonic crystal waveguides have recently emerged as an exciting platform for realizing novel quantum matter-light interfaces. Here we study tunable photon scattering in a photonic crystal waveguide coupled to an atom dimer with an arbitrary spatial separation. In the weak-excitation regime, we give the energy levels and their decay rates into the waveguide modes in the dressed basis, which both depend on the distance between the two atoms. We focus on the Bragg case and anti-Bragg case, where subradiant and superradiant states are produced and perfect transmission with a $\pi$ phase shift may occur on resonance. We observe quantum beats in the photon-photon correlation function of the reflected field in the anti-Bragg case. Moreover, the frequencies of quantum beats can be controlled due to the tunability of the bound states via the dispersion engineering of the structure. We also observe directional photon emission in the anti-Bragg case and give the dynamic mechanism of the perfect transmission. We quantify the effects of the system imperfections, including the deviation in the distance between the two atoms and the asymmetry in the atomic decay rates into the waveguide modes. With recent experimental advances in the superconducting microwave transmission lines, our results should soon be realizable.</p>

            <h2>Heralded entanglement of on-demand spin-wave solid-state quantum memories for multiplexed quantum network links</h2>

            <p>The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrowband parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin-state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feed-forward conditional phase-shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to \SI{500}{\cps}, with a measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead-time of \SI{100}{\micro\second}, leading to an entanglement rate of \SI{22}{\cps} per heralding detector, increased by a factor of 15 thanks to temporal multiplexing. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.</p>

            <p>Dissipative cat-qubits are a promising architecture for quantum processors due to their built-in quantum error correction. By leveraging two-photon stabilization, they achieve an exponentially suppressed bit-flip error rate as the distance in phase-space between their basis states increases, incurring only a linear increase in phase-flip rate. This property substantially reduces the number of qubits required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we implement a squeezing deformation of the cat qubit basis states, further extending the bit-flip time while minimally affecting the phase-flip rate. We demonstrate a steep reduction in the bit-flip error rate with increasing mean photon number, characterized by a scaling exponent $\gamma=4.3$, rising by a factor of 74 per added photon. Specifically, we measure bit-flip times of 22 seconds for a phase-flip time of 1.3 $\mu$s in a squeezed cat qubit with an average photon number $\bar{n}=4.1$, a 160-fold improvement in bit-flip time compared to a standard cat. Moreover, we demonstrate a two-fold reduction in $Z$-gate infidelity, with an estimated phase-flip probability of $\epsilon_X = 0.085$ and a bit-flip probability of $\epsilon_Z = 2.65 \cdot 10^{-9}$ which confirms the gate bias-preserving property. This simple yet effective technique enhances cat qubit performances without requiring design modification, moving multi-cat architectures closer to fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>A scheme for implementing quantum batteries in a realizable and controllable platform based on a trapped ion chain driven by a mechanical oscillator is proposed. The effects of the hopping interaction between the two-level ions and the coupling interaction between the ions and the external mechanical oscillator on the charging process of the battery are investigated. The importance of the counter-rotating wave terms in the system's Hamiltonian, which are often ignored, is analyzed, and it is found that the charging energy and the ergotropy of the battery are dramatically affected by the counter-rotating wave terms. The quantum phase transition of the two-level system is restrained by the counter-rotating wave terms due to the destruction of the quantum coherence. Lastly, the power-law dependence of the charging process on the distance between the ions is discussed. Our theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the development of a practical quantum battery.</p>

            <h2>Chirality, Nonreciprocity and Symmetries for a Giant Atom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luting Xu, Lingzhen Guo</p>
            <p>Chiral and nonreciprocal quantum devices are crucial for signal routing and processing in a quantum network. In this work, we study the chirality and nonreciprocity of a giant atom coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. We clarify that the chiral emission of the giant atom is not directly related to the time-reversal symmetry breaking but to the mirror-symmetry breaking. We propose a passive scheme to realize the chiral emission of a giant atom without breaking time-reversal symmetry by extending the legs of the giant atom. We find the time-reversal symmetry breaking via nonuniform coupling phases is artificial and thus cannot result in nonreciprocal single-photon scattering for the giant atom. The nonreciprocity of the giant atom can be obtained by the external dissipation of the giant atom that truly breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Our work clarifies the roles of symmetries in the chirality and nonreciprocity of giant-atom systems and paves the way for the design of on-chip functional devices with superconducting giant atoms.</p>

            <p>Non-classical mechanical states, as vital quantum resources for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior, have wide applications in the study of the fundamental quantum mechanics and modern quantum technology. In this work, we propose a scheme for deterministically generating non-classical mechanical states in cavity optomechanical systems. By working in the eigen-representation of the nonlinear optomechanical systems, we identify the carrier-wave resonance conditions and seek for the optimal driving pulses for state preparations. Concretely, we employ the reinforcement learning method to optimize the pulsed driving fields, effectively suppressing the undesired transitions induced by both the pulsed driving fields and dissipations. This approach enables the high-fidelity preparation of phononic Fock states and superposed Fock states in the single-resonator optomechanical systems, as well as two-mode entangled states in the two-resonator optomechanical systems. The statistical properties of the generated states are also examined. Our results open a way for quantum state engineering in quantum optics and quantum information science via reinforcement learning.</p>

            <p>We report intense terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons, representing a major step toward achieving stimulated cyclotron emission and polariton-based lasers. By strongly coupling the cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells with optical cavity modes, we observe efficient emission near the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates that polariton condensation, a process that bypasses the need for electronic population inversion, can significantly reduce the emission threshold compared to conventional mechanisms requiring high electric fields. Moreover, this concept unlocks the potential for stimulated emission in previously unsuitable narrow-gap semiconductors, as well as Dirac materials with non-equidistant Landau levels. These results open a new way for the development of compact, tunable terahertz lasers based on Landau polaritons, offering new opportunities for solid-state laser technology and applications in the terahertz gap.</p>

            <p>In this paper, the entanglement dynamics of different subsystems such as atom-atom, atom-field and field-field with radiation field in squeezed coherent thermal states for the intensity-dependent double Jaynes-Cummings model (IDDJCM) and double Jaynes-Cummings model (DJCM) are investigated. The effects of squeezed and thermal photons on entanglement are examined, revealing their complementary roles in shaping the entanglement behavior in both models. One of the main features of the double Jaynes-Cummings model is the observation of entanglement sudden death for every subsystem. The effects of various interactions such as Ising interaction, single photon exchange interaction and dipole-dipole interaction on entanglement dynamics are studied. The effects of detuning, Kerr-nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics are investigated for every subsystem. It is noticed that proper choice of the interactions parameters, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity effectively removes entanglement deaths from the dynamics.</p>

            <p>Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase regimes with the MBDL and delocalized states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase regimes. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL phase, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</p>

This method not only demonstrates its versatility, but also provides a generic framework for exploring other quantum information quantifiers in complex systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Clavero-Rubio, Tomas Ramos, Diego Porras</p>
            <p>We consider a linear array of trapped ions subjected to local parametric modulation of the trapping potential and continuous laser cooling. In our model, the phase of the parametric modulation varies linearly along the array, breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing non-trivial topological effects. The linear response to an external force is investigated with the Green's function formalism. We predict the appearance of topological amplification regimes in which the trapped ion array behaves as a directional amplifier of vibrational excitations. The emergence of topological phases is determined by a winding number related to non-Hermitian point-gap topology. Beyond its fundamental interests as a topological driven-dissipative system, our setup can be used for quantum sensing of ultra-weak forces and electric fields. We consider a scheme in which a trapped ion at one edge of the array acts as a sensor of an ultra-weak force, and the vibrational signal gets amplified towards the last trapped ion, which acts as a detector. We consider arrays of 2-30 $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ions, assuming that the detector ion's displacement is measured via fluorescence with a spatial resolution of 200-500 nm, and predict sensitivities as small as 1 yN $\cdot$ Hz$^{-1/2}$. Our system has the advantage that the detected force frequency can be tuned by adjusting the frequency of the periodic drive.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubhayan Sarkar</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a key resource to demonstrate quantum advantage over classical strategies. Entanglement in quantum states is one of the most well-explored areas in quantum physics. However, a rigorous approach to understanding and detecting entanglement in composite quantum measurements is lacking. In this work, we focus on composite quantum measurements and classify them into two classes: entangled and separable measurements. As done for quantum states, we define analogously a notion of witness that can be used to detect entanglement in composite quantum measurements. Here, one does not need to trust the measurement to witness its entanglement but must trust the quantum states. We then further extend this approach to show that any entangled measurement provides an advantage in network quantum steering without inputs, also known as swap steering. Consequently, this provides a way to witness entanglement in any quantum measurement in a one-sided device-independent way. Finally, we consider the star network scenario and show that any rank-one projective entangled quantum measurement gives a quantum advantage. Thus, one can detect the entanglement in any rank-one projective measurement in a device-independent way.</p>

            <p>Over the past several decades, the proliferation of global classical communication networks has transformed various facets of human society. Concurrently, quantum networking has emerged as a dynamic field of research, driven by its potential applications in distributed quantum computing, quantum sensor networks, and secure communications. This prompts a fundamental question: rather than constructing quantum networks from scratch, can we harness the widely available classical fiber-optic infrastructure to establish hybrid quantum-classical networks? This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of ongoing research endeavors aimed at integrating quantum communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution, into existing lightwave networks. This approach offers the substantial advantage of reducing implementation costs by allowing classical and quantum communication protocols to share optical fibers, communication hardware, and other network control resources, arguably the most pragmatic solution in the near term. In the long run, classical communication will also reap the rewards of innovative quantum communication technologies, such as quantum memories and repeaters. Accordingly, our vision for the future of the Internet is that of heterogeneous communication networks thoughtfully designed for the seamless support of both classical and quantum communications.</p>

            <p>Quantum battery exploits the principle of quantum mechanics to transport and store energy. We study the energy transportation of the central-spin quantum battery, which is composed of $N_b$ spins serving as the battery cells, and surrounded by $N_c$ spins serving as the charger cells. We apply the invariant subspace method to solve the dynamics of the central-spin battery with a large number of spins. We establish a universal inverse relationship between the battery capacity and the battery-charger entanglement, which persists in any size of the battery and charger cells. Moreover, we find that when $N_b=N_c$, the central-spin battery has the optimal energy transportation, corresponding to the minimal battery-charger entanglement. Surprisingly, the central-spin battery has a uniform energy transportation behaviors in certain battery-charger scales. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic relationship between the battery-charger size and the energy transportation efficiency, which may provide more insights on designing other types of quantum batteries.</p>

            <p>In contrast to the commonly used qubit resonator transverse coupling via the $\sigma_{xy}$-degree of freedom, longitudinal coupling through $\sigma_z$ presents a tantalizing alternative: it does not hybridize the modes, eliminating Purcell decay, and it enables quantum-non-demolishing qubit readout independent of the qubit-resonator frequency detuning. Here, we demonstrate longitudinal coupling between a {Cr$_7$Ni} molecular spin qubit ensemble and the kinetic inductance of a granular aluminum superconducting microwave resonator. The inherent frequency-independence of this coupling allows for the utilization of a 7.8 GHz readout resonator to measure the full {Cr$_7$Ni} magnetization curve spanning 0-600 mT, corresponding to a spin frequency range of $f_\text{spin}=$0-15 GHz. For 2 GHz detuning from the readout resonator, we measure a $1/e$ spin relaxation time $\tau=$0.38 s, limited by phonon decay to the substrate.

            <p>Recent advancements in quantum technologies have opened new horizons for exploring the physical world in ways once deemed impossible. Central to these breakthroughs is the concept of quantum advantage, where quantum systems outperform their classical counterparts in solving specific tasks. While much attention has been devoted to computational speedups, quantum advantage in learning physical systems remains a largely untapped frontier. Here, we present a photonic implementation of a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning the probability distribution of a multimode bosonic displacement process. By harnessing the unique properties of continuous-variable quantum entanglement, we obtain a massive advantage in sample complexity with respect to conventional methods without entangled resources. With approximately 5 dB of two-mode squeezing -- corresponding to imperfect Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen (EPR) entanglement -- we learn a 100-mode bosonic displacement process using 11.8 orders of magnitude fewer samples than a conventional scheme. Our results demonstrate that even with non-ideal, noisy entanglement, a significant quantum advantage can be realized in continuous-variable quantum systems. This marks an important step towards practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols with implications for quantum metrology, certification, and machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephan Rachel, Roland Wiesendanger</p>
            <p>For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.</p>

            <h2>The impact of hole $g$-factor anisotropy on spin-photon entanglement generation with InGaAs quantum dots</h2>

            <p>Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.</p>

For this purpose, we introduce a new entanglement witness, well-suited for the graviton-matter interaction Hamiltonian analysed here. We show that the witness is non-zero for the three-mode states generated by the Hamiltonian when the system starts in the ground state, thus proving the generation of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement at the most fundamental level of theoretical graviton-matter interactions.</p>

            <p>The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moiré materials.</p>

            <p>Quantum photonic simulators have emerged as indispensable tools for modeling and optimizing quantum photonic circuits, bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental implementations. This review explores the landscape of photonic quantum simulation, focusing on the transition from Gaussian to non-Gaussian models and the computational challenges associated with simulating large-scale photonic systems. Gaussian states and operations, which enable efficient simulations through covariance matrices and phase-space representations, serve as the foundation for photonic quantum computing. However, non-Gaussian states crucial for universal quantum computation introduce significant computational complexity, requiring advanced numerical techniques such as tensor networks and high-performance GPU acceleration. We evaluate the leading photonic quantum simulators, including Strawberry Fields, Piquasso, QuTiP SimulaQron, Perceval, and this http URL analyzing their capabilities in handling continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum systems. Special attention is given to hardware-accelerated methods, including GPU-based tensor network approaches, machine learning integration, and hybrid quantum-classical workflows. Furthermore, we investigate noise modeling techniques, such as photon loss and dark counts, and their impact on simulation accuracy. As photonic quantum computing moves toward practical implementations, advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) architectures, such as tensor processing units (TPUs) and system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions, are accelerating the field.

            <h2>Quantum automated learning with provable and explainable trainability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Ye, Shuangyue Geng, Zizhao Han, Weikang Li, L.-M. Duan, Dong-Ling Deng</p>
            <p>Machine learning is widely believed to be one of the most promising practical applications of quantum computing. Existing quantum machine learning schemes typically employ a quantum-classical hybrid approach that relies crucially on gradients of model parameters. Such an approach lacks provable convergence to global minima and will become infeasible as quantum learning models scale up. Here, we introduce quantum automated learning, where no variational parameter is involved and the training process is converted to quantum state preparation. In particular, we encode training data into unitary operations and iteratively evolve a random initial state under these unitaries and their inverses, with a target-oriented perturbation towards higher prediction accuracy sandwiched in between. Under reasonable assumptions, we rigorously prove that the evolution converges exponentially to the desired state corresponding to the global minimum of the loss function. We show that such a training process can be understood from the perspective of preparing quantum states by imaginary time evolution, where the data-encoded unitaries together with target-oriented perturbations would train the quantum learning model in an automated fashion. We further prove that the quantum automated learning paradigm features good generalization ability with the generalization error upper bounded by the ratio between a logarithmic function of the Hilbert space dimension and the number of training samples. In addition, we carry out extensive numerical simulations on real-life images and quantum data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the assumptions. Our results establish an unconventional quantum learning strategy that is gradient-free with provable and explainable trainability, which would be crucial for large-scale practical applications of quantum computing in machine learning scenarios.</p>

            <p>We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>We theoretically propose a scheme to explore the magnetically and magnomechanically induced transparency phenomena in a cross-cavity magnomechanical system, focusing on the role of relative phase and the intensity of the two probing fields in enhancing the absorption and transmission spectra and manipulating the group delay of the transmitted light. Interestingly, the relative phase of the two probe fields could have overwhelming effects on both the absorption spectrum and the group delay of the output field. Tuning the relative phase and amplitude of the probe fields can suppress or enhance the absorption and transmission spectra. The combined effect of the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings, along with relative phase modulations, helps to switch the probe field's behavior from subluminal to superluminal in the current system. The current study offers a straightforward and practical approach, demonstrating the capability to employ the relative phase for the modulation of microwave signals within the cavity magnomechanical system, providing insights for the design of information transduction and quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Energy Teleportation: A Novel Protocol Relaxing Previous Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songbo Xie, Manas Sajjan, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>Quantum state teleportation (QST) is a foundational protocol for transferring quantum information across long distances. Building on this concept, quantum energy teleportation (QET) was introduced to facilitate the transfer of energy. However, QET has traditionally been thought to impose much stricter constraints than QST, including the need for the initial state to be the ground state of a specific interacting Hamiltonian, for Alice's measurement to commute with the interaction terms, and for the ground state to exhibit entanglement. These constraints limit broader application of the QET protocol. In this work, we challenge these notions and demonstrate for the first time that none of these constraints are fundamentally necessary. We propose a novel QET protocol that relaxes all these constraints, offering a more flexible and generalized framework. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a "local effective Hamiltonian," which removes the need for optimization techniques in determining Bob's optimal energy extraction. These advancements enhance our understanding of QET and extends its broader applications for quantum technologies. To support our findings, we implement the protocol on quantum hardware, confirming its theoretical validity and experimental feasibility.</p>

We use this model to predict three- and four-qubit experiments and observe excellent agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental results. Our technique enables researchers to study the dynamics of multi-qubit circuits without performing experiments, potentially facilitating the minimization of coherent gate errors via digital pulse precompilation.

Second, we improve second-order correction terms in the key rate expression, by reducing them to scale with the number of sifted rounds rather than the total number of protocol rounds. We apply these advancements to compute finite-size key rates for a qubit and decoy-state BB84 protocol, accommodating arbitrary protocol parameters. Finally, we extend our finite-size security proof to coherent attacks and variable-length protocols and present our results for the decoy-state 4-6 protocol incorporating imperfections such as unequal intensity settings.</p>

            <p>Precise qubit control in the presence of spatio-temporally correlated noise is pivotal for transitioning to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generically, such noise can also have non-Gaussian statistics, which hampers existing non-Markovian noise spectroscopy protocols. By utilizing frame-based characterization and a novel symmetry analysis, we show how to achieve higher-order spectral estimation for noise-optimized circuit design. Remarkably, we find that the digitally driven qubit dynamics can be solely determined by the complexity of the applied control, rather than the non-perturbative nature of the non-Gaussian environment. This enables us to address certain non-perturbative qubit dynamics more simply. We delineate several complexity bounds for learning such high-complexity noise and demonstrate our single and two-qubit digital characterization and control using a series of numerical simulations. Our results not only provide insights into the exact solvability of (small-sized) open quantum dynamics but also highlight a resource-efficient approach for optimal control and possible error reduction techniques for current qubit devices.</p>

In this paper, we investigate the flux-noise origin of these nonmonotonic Ramsey fringes in frequency-tunable transmon qubits. We develop a random telegraph noise (RTN) model to simulate the impact of telegraph-like flux-noise sources on Ramsey oscillations. Our simulations demonstrate that strong flux-RTN sources can induce beating patterns in the Ramsey fringes, showing excellent agreement with experimental observations in transmon qubits influenced by electronic environment-induced flux-noise. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of flux-noise in qubit decoherence and underscore the importance of considering flux-noise RTN when analyzing nonmonotonic Ramsey fringes.</p>

            <p>Cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) provides a significant way to produce $\sim$10 MHz narrow-band photon pairs, which matches the bandwidth of photon for quantum memory. However, the output photon pairs from the cavity is not entangled and the postselection is required to create the entanglement outside the cavity, so the direct output of cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photon pairs is still an open challenge. Here we propose a solution that realizes the first postselection-free cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photon pairs. The entanglement is achieved in degree of freedom (DOF) of orbital angular momentum (OAM) by implementing an OAM-conservation SPDC process in an actively and precisely controlled cavity supporting degenerate high-order OAM modes. The measured linewidth for the two photons is 13.8 MHz and the measured fidelity is 0.969(3) for the directly generated OAM entangled two photons. We deterministically transfer the OAM entanglement to polarization one with almost no loss and obtain polarization entangled two photons with a fidelity of 0.948(2). Moreover, we produce narrow-band OAM-polarization hyperentangled photon pairs with a fidelity of 0.850(2) by establishing polarization entanglement with preservation of OAM entanglement, which is realized by interfering the two photons on a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and post-selecting the events of one and only one photon in on each of the PBS port. Novel cavity may find applications in cavity-based light-matter interaction. Our results provide an efficient and promising approach to create narrow-band entangled photon sources for memory-based long-distance quantum communication and network.</p>

            <p>We provide a generalized treatment of uncertainties, von Neumann entropy and squeezing in entangled bipartite pure state of two-level atoms. We observe that when the bipartite state is entangled, though the von Neumann entropy of the composite state is less than those of the subsystems, as first recognized by Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger, but the uncertainty of the composite state is greater than those of the subsystems for certain ranges of the superposing constants of the quantum state. This is in contradiction with the prevailing consensus that more is the entropy, more is the uncertainty. Hence, for those ranges of the superposing constants of the quantum state though there is violation of the entropic inequalities, the subsystems exhibit less disorder than the system as a whole. We also provide a generalized relationship between the von Neumann entropy of the subsystems and the uncertainty, spin squeezing and spectroscopic squeezing, used in the context of Ramsey spectroscopy, of the composite state. This gives a generalized operational measure of von Neumann entropy of the entangled subsystems of two-level atoms.</p>

            <p>We characterize the dynamical state of many-body bosonic and fermionic many-body models with inter-site Gaussian couplings, on-site non-Gaussian interactions and local dissipation comprising incoherent particle loss, particle gain, and dephasing. We first establish that, for fermionic systems, if the dephasing noise is larger than the non-Gaussian interactions, irrespective of the Gaussian coupling strength, the system state is a convex combination of Gaussian states at all times. Furthermore, for bosonic systems, we show that if the particle loss and particle gain rates are larger than the Gaussian inter-site couplings, the system remains in a separable state at all times. Building on this characterization, we establish that at noise rates above a threshold, there exists a classical algorithm that can efficiently sample from the system state of both the fermionic and bosonic models. Finally, we show that, unlike fermionic systems, bosonic systems can evolve into states that are not convex-Gaussian even when the dissipation is much higher than the on-site non-Gaussianity. Similarly, unlike bosonic systems, fermionic systems can generate entanglement even with noise rates much larger than the inter-site couplings.</p>

We describe the notion of the Robertson-Scrödinger uncertainty principle (RSUP) and positive partial transpose (PPT) conditions for allowed quantum states and separable states, respectively, for NC-space. RSUP and PPT provide the restrictions on all allowed states and separable states, respectively. This enables us to estimate the relative volumes of set of separable states and entangled states. Numerical estimations are provided for a toy model of a bipartite Gaussian state. We restrict our study to such bipartite Gaussian states, for which the entanglement is induced by the noncommutative phase-space parameters.</p>

            <p>We study the effects of a parametric frequency converter in a two-mode cavity system where one of the cavity mode is coupled with yttrium iron garnet (YIG) via magnetic dipole interaction. Parametric frequency converter acts as a nonlinear source for enhanced entanglement among all bipartitions and asymmetrical quantum steering. The behavior of the two types of quantum correlations are shown to be dependent on parametric coupling and the associated phase factor. We show that cavity-cavity entanglement and cavity-phonon entanglement (cavity-magnon entanglement) decreases (increases) with the increase of the parametric phase factor {\phi}. In addition, generated entanglements in the present system have shown to be more robust against the thermal effects, with the inclusion of the parametric converter as compared with the bare cavity case. Another intriguing finding is the asymmetric one-way steering, where we notice that magnon and phonon modes can steer the indirectly coupled cavity modes, yet the steering in swapped direction is not observed. It is of great interest that the perfect transfer of entanglement and quantum steering is achieved among different modes by adjusting the system's parameters. In fact, our protocol for these transferring processes suggests a different approach to the processing and storage of quantum information.</p>

            <p>Biphoton sources that use room-temperature or hot atoms are valuable for real-world applications in long-distance quantum communication and photonic quantum computation. The heralded single photons produced by biphoton sources using the double-$\Lambda$ spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process offer advantages of narrow linewidth, stable frequency, and tunable linewidth -- qualities not found in other types of biphoton sources. In this study, we investigated a hot-atom SFWM double-$\Lambda$ biphoton source. We discovered that, under the condition counterintuitive to the present theory, heralded single photons of the source enhanced their generation rate by a factor of 3.6, heralding probability by a factor of 3.0, temporal width by 2.1, and spectral brightness by a factor of 10. These unexpected findings led us to propose a new theoretical framework for a previously unexplored physical mechanism. Our proposed theory effectively explains the observed results. Traditionally, similar spectral brightness (SB) from atom-based sources resulted in a lower signal-to-background ratio (SBR) than crystal- or chip-based biphoton sources, mainly due to poorer heralding probabilities. In our work, we experimentally demonstrated that the SBR improved by a factor of 4.8 while maintaining a comparable SB. As a result, the SBR performance of the atom-based biphoton source is now on par with that of crystal- or chip-based sources. This research introduces a new tuning parameter for double-$\Lambda$ SFWM biphoton sources, enhances our understanding of biphoton generation, and opens new avenues for improving the performance of these sources.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Non-Local Magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are fundamental resources that characterize distinct aspects of a quantum state: entanglement reflects non-local correlations, while magic quantifies the deviation from stabilizer states. A quantum state becomes a valuable resource for applications like universal quantum computation only when both quantities are present. Here, we propose that quantum non-local magic (NM) serves as an effective measure of this combined resource, incorporating both entanglement and magic. We demonstrate that NM can be precisely computed for two-qubit pure states, where it is directly related to the entanglement spectrum. We then extend the definition of NM to mixed states and explore its presence in many-body quantum systems, revealing that the two-point NM decays according to a power law in critical states. Furthermore, we explore measurement-induced NM and uncover an intriguing phenomenon termed "magic swapping", analogous to entanglement swapping, wherein post-measurement NM decays more slowly than any pre-measurement correlations. Our results thus represent a pivotal step towards accurately quantifying the "quantumness" of a state and reveal the potential for manipulating this resource through measurements.</p>

            <h2>How to Entangle or Disentangle Gaussian States with Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference</h2>

            <p>The interference of two indistinguishable photons from a photon pair on a balanced beam splitter, where each photon enters in one of the input ports, yields a maximally entangled N00N-state shared between the outputs of the beam splitter through Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. At the same time, interference between the two modes of a two-mode squeezed state - the generalized output of a parametric photon-pair source - yields two independent, hence separable, single-mode squeezed states. Notably, both experiments use the exact same experimental setup. We resolve this seeming contradiction by measuring photon-number resolved quantum interference of the two modes of a two-mode squeezed state from an engineered parametric down-conversion source and show that the notion of inseparability is a result of post-selection on the presence of photons. Indeed, the complete joint photon statistics including the vacuum component are separable, as expected from textbook calculations.</p>

            <p>The calibration of high-quality two-qubit entangling gates is an essential component in engineering large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, many standard calibration techniques are based on randomized circuits that are only quadratically sensitive to calibration errors. As a result, these approaches are inefficient, requiring many experimental shots to achieve acceptable performance. In this work, we demonstrate that robust phase estimation can enable high-precision, Heisenberg-limited estimates of coherent errors in multi-qubit gates. Equipped with an efficient estimator, the calibration problem may be reduced to a simple optimization loop that minimizes the estimated coherent error. We experimentally demonstrate our calibration protocols by improving the operation of a two-qubit controlled-Z gate on a superconducting processor, and we validate the improved performance with gate set tomography. Our methods are applicable to gates in other quantum hardware platforms such as ion traps and neutral atoms, and on other multi-qubit gates, such as CNOT or iSWAP.</p>

            <p>The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</p>

            <p>The pursuit of quantum-enhanced parameter estimations without the need for nonclassical initial states has long been driven by the goal of achieving experimentally accessible quantum metrology. In this work, employing a coherent averaging mechanism, we prove that the prototypical cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, such as the Tavis-Cummings model, enables us to achieve not only the Heisenberg scaling (HS) precision in terms of the average photon number but also the double-HS sensitivity concerning both the average photon and atom numbers. Such a double sensibility can be experimentally realized by introducing either photon- or atom-number fluctuations through quantum squeezing. Furthermore, we discuss the methodology to achieve this double-HS precision in a realistic experimental circumstance where the squeezing is not perfect. Our results provide insights into understanding the coherent averaging mechanism for evaluating quantum-enhanced precision measurements and also present a usable metrological application of the cavity QED systems and superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>We present a cooling algorithm for ground state preparation of fermionic Hamiltonians. Our algorithm makes use of the Hamiltonian simulation of the considered system coupled to an ancillary fridge, which is regularly reset to its known ground state. We derive suitable interaction Hamiltonians that originate from ladder operators of the free theory and initiate resonant gaps between system and fridge. We further propose a spectroscopic scan to find the relevant eigenenergies of the system using energy measurements on the fridge. With these insights, we design a ground state cooling algorithm for fermionic systems that is efficient, i.e. its runtime is polynomial in the system size, as long as the initial state is prepared in a low-energy sector of polynomial size. We achieve the latter via a pseudo-adiabatic sweep from a parameter regime whose ground state can be easily prepared. We estimate that our algorithm has a polynomial runtime for systems where the spectral gap decreases at most polynomially in system size, and is faster than the adiabatic algorithm for a large range of settings. We generalize the algorithm to prepare thermal states and demonstrate our findings on the Fermi-Hubbard model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kento Tsubouchi, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Kunal Sharma, Nobuyuki Yoshioka</p>
            <p>Twirling noise affecting quantum gates is essential in understanding and controlling errors, but applicable operations to noise are usually restricted by symmetries inherent in quantum gates. In this work, we propose symmetric Clifford twirling, a Clifford twirling utilizing only symmetric Clifford operators that commute with certain Pauli subgroups. We fully characterize how each Pauli noise is converted through the twirling and show that certain Pauli noise can be scrambled to a noise exponentially close to the global white noise. Moreover, we provide numerical demonstrations for highly structured circuits, such as Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation circuits, that noise effect on typical observables can be described by the global white noise. We further demonstrate that symmetric Clifford twirling and its hardware-efficient variant using only a local symmetric Clifford operators acting on a few logical qubits can significantly accelerate the scrambling. These findings enable us to mitigate errors in non-Clifford operations with minimal sampling overhead in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack Cunningham, Jun Zhuang</p>
            <p>In recent years, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have been widely explored to advance quantum circuits against classic models on various domains, such as quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning. Similar to classic machine-learning models, VQCs can be trained through various optimization approaches, such as gradient-based or gradient-free methods. However, when employing gradient-based methods, the gradient variance of VQCs may dramatically vanish as the number of qubits or layers increases. This issue, a.k.a. Barren Plateaus (BPs), seriously hinders the scaling of VQCs on large datasets. To mitigate the barren plateaus, extensive efforts have been devoted to tackling this issue through diverse strategies. In this survey, we conduct a systematic literature review of recent works from both investigation and mitigation perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize most existing mitigation strategies into five groups and introduce them in detail. Also, we compare the concurrent survey papers about BPs. Finally, we provide insightful discussion on future directions for BPs.</p>

            <p>We present a thorough investigation of nonstabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</p>

            <p>Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) leverage untrained quantum dynamics to efficiently process information encoded in input quantum states, avoiding the high computational cost of training more complicated nonlinear models. On the other hand, quantum information scrambling (QIS) quantifies how the spread of quantum information into correlations makes it irretrievable from local measurements. Here, we explore the tight relation between QIS and the predictive power of QELMs. In particular, we show efficient state estimation is possible even beyond the scrambling time, for many different types of dynamics -- in fact, we show that in all the cases we studied, the reconstruction efficiency at long interaction times matches the optimal one offered by random global unitary dynamics. These results offer promising venues for robust experimental QELM-based state estimation protocols, as well as providing novel insights into the nature of QIS from a state estimation perspective.</p>

            <p>Bipartite perfect quantum strategies (BPQSs) allow two players isolated from each other to win every trial of a nonlocal game. BPQSs have crucial roles in recent developments in quantum information and quantum computation. However, only few BPQSs with a small number of inputs are known and only one of them has been experimentally tested. It has recently been shown that every BPQS has an associated Kochen-Specker (KS) set. Here, we first prove that any BPQS of minimum input cardinality that can be obtained from a generalized KS set can also be obtained from a KS set of pure states. Then, we address the problem of finding BPQSs of small input cardinality starting from KS sets. We introduce an algorithm that identifies the BPQS with the minimum number of settings for any given KS set. We apply it to many well-known KS sets of small cardinality in dimensions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. In each dimension, the algorithm either recovers the best BPQS known or find one with fewer inputs.</p>

Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions for these conditions.

            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs) exploit principles of quantum mechanics to accelerate the charging process and aim to achieve optimal energy storage. However, analytical results for investigating these problems remain lacking due to the challenges associated with nonequilibrium dynamics. In this work, we analytically investigate a central-spin QB model in which $N_b$ spin-1/2 battery cells interact with $N_c$ spin-1/2 charger units, using $m$ initially excited charger units as a resource. By employing the invariant subspace method and the shifted Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we identify four scenarios in which optimal energy storage can be achieved: (i) $N_b\!\ll\!m\!\ll\!N_c$; (ii) $m\!\ll\!N_b\!\ll\!N_c$; (iii) $m\!\ll\!N_c\!\ll\!N_b$; and (iv) $N_b\!\ll\!m\!=\!kN_c$ [$k\!\in\!(0,1)$]. In these cases, optimal storage is ensured by the SU(2) symmetry emerging from the charging dynamics. The first three cases map the central-spin QB to different Tavis-Cummings (TC) QBs, while the fourth corresponds to the non-TC limit. We analytically determine the charging time and demonstrate that in the fully charging cases (i) and (iv), the collective charging exhibits an $N_b$-fold enhancement in speedup compared to the parallel charging scheme. Additionally, we numerically observe a unified charging behavior when $m\!=\!N_c$, showing that asymptotically optimal energy storage is possible when $N_b\!=\!m\!=\!N_c$. In this case, we find a collective charging enhancement scaling as $N_b^{0.8264}$. The origin of the collective charging advantage in central-spin quantum batteries is also analyzed through the quantum speed limit and a multipartite entanglement witness. Our results highlight the crucial role of dynamically emergent SU(2) symmetry in providing an analytical understanding of non-equilibrium charging dynamics in QBs.</p>

The time dependence is demonstrated for the heat flux between two isolated nanoparticles. After one particle starts radiating, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux exhibits oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room- or higher-temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.</p>

            <p>We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as graphs with certain structures. Specifically, the graphs take a semi-bipartite form wherein $k$ "input" nodes map to $n$ "output" nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove by passage through the ZX Calculus that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at small scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[54, 6, 5]]$ code and families of $[[n, \Theta(\frac{n}{\log n}), \Theta(\log n)]]$ and $[[n, \Omega(n^{3/5}), \Theta(n^{1/5}) ]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight trade-off. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the above two families. This class contains all graphs of girth at least 9, building a bridge between stabilizer codes and extremal graph theory. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</p>

To ensure physicality, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is incorporated into the DQC1 reconstruction process, with numerical simulations demonstrating the efficiency of our approach and its robustness against interferometer noises. This method offers a resource-efficient solution for state characterization in large-scale LONs to advance photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Hua Yu</p>
            <p>We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates through free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to a detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We consider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of the wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the detection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the slits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function evolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the vertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an approximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the function characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows wider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally collapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope of this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits. Hence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the Schroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is narrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit, where it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is lost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase information, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the y-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on the counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe the process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show this function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is closely related to the wave function.</p>

            <h2>Heading towards an Algebraic Heisenberg Cut</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathias Van Den Bossche, Philippe Grangier</p>
            <p>In previous papers we have explained how a sequence of theorems by John von Neumann on infinite tensor products (ITP) can be understood as providing elements to support both sectorisation of the Hilbert space of large quantum systems, and a mechanism of self decoherence thereof. These two effects may help understanding the articulation of the classical and quantum realms. However, as they involve considering an infinite number of quantum degrees of freedom, legitimate concerns can be raised on their applicability. In this paper, we address explicitly the interface between both realms through the example of a simplified model of a photon polarisation measurement device. Guided by the fact that there is von Neumann sectorisation at infinity, and by the necessity of classical contexts to perform measurements, we show that this limit can be under control, and that although the full force of the sectorisation theorems requires taking the infinite limit, early signs of the macroscopic behaviour appear before infinity. In our example, this shows up in photodiodes through diverging electron avalanches that simultaneously make the system classical, localise it randomly in a macroscopic sector and provide a macroscopic signal. This lays the grounds for justifying the inclusion in quantum physics of the ITP formalism, which involves non-separable Hilbert spaces and potentially type-III von Neumann algebras. Such an approach could make sense of the quantum-classical transition as a primarily algebraic one.</p>

We demonstrate the proposed protocol by designing a teleportation circuit that incorporates the necessary quantum gates. The fidelity of the teleportation process is evaluated through simulations, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed scheme. The protocol restores teleported states without requiring CNOT operations or auxiliary qubits, offering a significant advantage in resource efficiency(utilization). A comparative analysis of the intrinsic efficiency with previous approaches establishes that the proposed protocol brings forth an efficient approach for achieving two-way quantum teleportation.</p>

            <p>The ground-state spin of optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) offers a promising platform for quantum information applications, such as qubits for quantum computing and nanoscale sensing. A key characteristic of a qubit is its decoherence time, as its duration and controllability are critical for practical applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the electron spin dephasing time of the negatively charged boron vacancies, $V_{B}$ centers, in the hBN lattice by considering the dipolar hyperfine as well as spin-phonon interactions. We employ an approximate method based on the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to take into account a large number of nuclear spins and Debye model to consider the effect of lattice phonons. We show that, in the presence of the dipolar hyperfine interactions, Hahn-echo coherence time of the $V_{B}$ electron spin is approximately $30\: \mathrm{\mu s}$ at room temperature. Our results provide a step forward in understanding the $V_{B}$ defect decoherence in the hBN, which might be used for quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>A Faster Quantum Fourier Transform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronit Shah</p>
            <p>We present an asymptotically improved algorithm for implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) in both the exact and approximate settings. Historically, the approximate QFT has been implemented in $\Theta(n \log n)$ gates, and the exact in $\Theta(n^2)$ gates. In this work, we show that these costs can be reduced by leveraging a novel formulation of the QFT that recurses on two partitions of the qubits. Specifically, our approach yields an $\Theta(n(\log \log n)^2)$ algorithm for the approximate QFT using $\Theta(\log n)$ ancillas, and an $\Theta(n(\log n)^2)$ algorithm for the exact QFT requiring $\Theta(n)$ ancillas.</p>

            <h2>Quantum circuit for exponentiation of Hamiltonians: an algorithmic description based on tensor products</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerard Fleury, Philippe Lacomme</p>
            <p>Exponentiation of Hamiltonians refers to a mathematical operation to a Hamiltonian operator, typically in the form e^(-i.t.H), where H is the Hamiltonian and t is a time parameter. This operation is fundamental in quantum mechanics, particularly to evolve quantum systems over time according to the Schrodinger equation. In quantum algorithms, such as Adiabatic methods and QAOA, exponentiation enables efficient simulation of a system dynamics. It involves constructing quantum circuits that approximate this exponential operation. When H=\sum_(p=1)^n H_p , each H_p is defined using the Pauli operator basis, which includes the well-known X, Y, Z and Id gates, i.e., H_p=U_1\otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n and U_k\in{Id,X,Y,Z}. In this article, we explore the exponentiation of H_p, specifically e^(-i.t.U_1 \otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n ), by introducing an algorithmic approach. We demonstrate a straightforward and efficient method to construct compact circuits that are easy to implement.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</p>

In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suman Dutta, Siyi Wang, Anubhab Baksi, Anupam Chattopadhyay, Subhamoy Maitra</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider the optimized implementation of Multi Controlled Toffoli (MCT) using the Clifford $+$ T gate sets. While there are several recent works in this direction, here we explicitly quantify the trade-off (with concrete formulae) between the Toffoli depth (this means the depth using the classical 2-controlled Toffoli) of the $n$-controlled Toffoli (hereform we will tell $n$-MCT) and the number of clean ancilla qubits. Additionally, we achieve a reduced Toffoli depth (and consequently, T-depth), which is an extension of the technique introduced by Khattar et al. (2024). In terms of a negative result, we first show that using such conditionally clean ancilla techniques, Toffoli depth can never achieve exactly $\ceil{\log_2 n}$, though it remains of the same order. This highlights the limitation of the techniques exploiting conditionally clean ancilla [Nie et al., 2024, Khattar et al., 2024]. Then we prove that, in a more general setup, the T-Depth in the Clifford + T decomposition, via Toffoli gates, is lower bounded by $\ceil{\log_2 n}$, and this bound is achieved following the complete binary tree structure. Since the ($2$-controlled) Toffoli gate can further be decomposed using Clifford $+$ T, various methodologies are explored too in this regard for trade-off related implications.</p>

            <h2>Instrumental distortions in quantum optimal control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uluk Rasulov, Ilya Kuprov</p>
            <p>Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual jumble of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, amplifiers, and filters can and do distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next, and across the sample. Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering (RAW-GRAPE) framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions within the GRAPE optimisation loop, does not require filter function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles. The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.</p>

Experimentally observed data are in good agreement with theoretical simulations. Some mitigation strategies against the backflash attack are also discussed.</p>

            <p>We formulate a robust optimal control algorithm to synthesize minimum energy pulses that can transfer a cold atom system into various momentum states. The algorithm uses adaptive linearization of the evolution operator and sequential quadratic programming to iterate the control towards a minimum energy signal that achieves optimal target state fidelity. Robustness to parameter variation is achieved using Legendre polynomial approximation over the domain of variation. The method is applied to optimize the Bragg beamsplitting operation in ultra-cold atom interferometry. Even in the presence of 10-40% variability in the initial momentum dispersion of the atomic cloud and the intensity of the optical pulse, the algorithm reliably converges to a control protocol that robustly achieves unprecedented momentum levels with high fidelity for a single-frequency multi-photon Bragg diffraction scheme (e.g. $|\pm 40\hbar k\rangle$). Advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparison to stochastic optimization using sampled parameter values.</p>

            <p>We present a modified version of the Bravyi-Terhal bound that applies to quantum codes defined by local parity-check constraints on a $D$-dimensional lattice quotient. Specifically, we consider a quotient $\mathbb{Z}^D/\Lambda$ of $\mathbb{Z}^D$ of cardinality $n$, where $\Lambda$ is some $D$-dimensional sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^D$: we suppose that every vertex of this quotient indexes $m$ qubits of a stabilizer code $C$, which therefore has length $nm$. We prove that if all stabilizer generators act on qubits whose indices lie within a ball of radius $\rho$, then the minimum distance $d$ of the code satisfies $d \leq m\sqrt{\gamma_D}(\sqrt{D} + 4\rho)n^\frac{D-1}{D}$ whenever $n^{1/D} \geq 8\rho\sqrt{\gamma_D}$, where $\gamma_D$ is the $D$-dimensional Hermite constant. We apply this bound to derive an upper bound on the minimum distance of Abelian Two-Block Group Algebra (2BGA) codes whose parity-check matrices have the form $[\mathbf{A} \, \vert \, \mathbf{B}]$ with each submatrix representing an element of a group algebra over a finite abelian group.</p>

These discrete models are useful to study unzipping of a single adsorbed polymer from a surface. Our results show that the discrete models also undergo a phase transition from a PT unbroken phase to a broken phase.

            <p>By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</p>

            <h2>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Weisse, R. Gerstner, J. Sirker</p>
            <p>We consider the spreading of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the operator growth hypothesis with questions of localization. We analytically show that an almost factorial growth of the operator norm - as recently proven for the random Ising model - is inconsistent with an exponential localization of $A$. Assuming that a quasi-local unitary $U$ exists which maps $H$ onto an effective Hamiltonian $\tilde H=UHU^\dagger=\sum_n E_n \tau^z_n +\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \tau^z_i\tau^z_j+\dots$, we show that $\tilde A=UAU^\dagger$ is a quasi-local operator which in the many-body case does not remain exponentially localized in general leading to an almost factorial norm growth. Therefore the unitary $U$ in many-body systems with maximal norm growth either does not exist and such systems are always ergodic or unusual non-ergodic phases described by $\tilde H$ do exist which violate the operator growth hypothesis and in which operators spread, implying that transport will eventually set in. We analytically and symbolically verify our results for the Anderson and Aubry-André models. For the XXX case, the symbolic calculations are consistent with a maximal norm growth. Furthermore, we find no indication of a weakened exponential localization of $A$, expected for strong disorder and low commutator orders if the unitary $U$ does exist. Finally, we try to perturbatively construct $U$ by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. While it is straightforward to show that this construction converges in the Anderson case, we find no indications for a convergence in the interacting case, suggesting that $U$ does not exist and that many-body localization is absent.</p>

            <p>Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time? This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</p>

We discuss the gravitational effects in the presence of Ricci scalar curvature $R=R_{\upsilon }^{\upsilon }$. It is observed that the presence of the Ricci scalar curvature, effectively and manifestly, introduces a force field that makes the corresponding quantum mechanical repulsive core more repulsive. Similar effect is also observed for the EiBI-gravitational field. We reiterate and report that the corresponding bosonic KG-oscillator quantum mechanical system admits a solution in the form of confluent Heun functions, the truncation of which into a physically admissible polynomial is shown to be associated with some parametric correlations/conditions. The use of such conditions/correlations is mandatory and yields a set of allowed/restricted quantum mechanical orbital $\ell $-excitations, for all radial quantum numbers $n_{r}\geq 0$. Our procedure is shown to be quite handy, in the since that it allows one to retrieve results for KG-oscillators in GM-spacetime in different EiBI-gravity and Ricci scalar curvature settings.</p>

            <p>Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.</p>

            <p>Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Roos, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel</p>
            <p>We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</p>

            <p>Continuous superradiance using a narrow optical transition has the potential to improve the short-term stability of state-of-the-art optical clocks. Even though pulsed superradiant emission on a mHz linewidth clock transition has been shown, true continuous operation, without Fourier limitation, has turned out to be extremely challenging. The trade-off between maintaining a high atomic flux while minimizing decoherence effects presents a significant obstacle. Here, we discuss the design of a machine that could overcome this problem by combining a high-flux continuous beam of ultra cold strontium atoms with a bowtie cavity for the generation of superradiant lasing. To evaluate the feasibility of our design, we present simulation results for continuous high-efficiency cooling, loading, and pumping to the upper lasing state inside the bowtie cavity. We then present two different models for stimulating the generated superradiant field by taking into account position-dependent shifts, collisional decoherence, light shifts, and atom loss. Finally, we estimate a laser linewidth of less than 100 mHz, limited by atom number fluctuations, and resulting in an output power of hundreds of fW.</p>

In this paper, we show that duality in the Topological Holography formalism can be realized with a Sequential Quantum Circuit applied to the top boundary. As a consequence, the Hamiltonians before and after the duality mapping have exactly the same spectrum in the corresponding symmetry sectors, and the entanglement in the corresponding low-energy eigenstates differs by at most an area law term.</p>

            <p>We use a combinatorial approach to obtain exact expressions for the many-body density of states of fermionic and bosonic gases with equally spaced single-particle spectra. We identify a mapping that reveals a remarkable property, namely, fermionic and bosonic gases have the same many-body density of states, up to a shift corresponding to ground state energy. Additionally, we show that there is a regime, comprising the validity range of the Bethe approximation, where the many-body density of states becomes independent of the number of particles.</p>

            <p>Biomarkers play a central role in medicine's gradual progress towards proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, for example for multi-factorial diseases, has been challenging. Discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective paper, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types - multi-dimensional, time series, and erroneous data - and covers key data modalities in healthcare - electronic health records (EHRs), omics, and medical images. An outlook is provided concerning open research challenges.</p>

            <h2>Correlation hypergraph: a new representation of a quantum marginal independence pattern</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veronika E. Hubeny, Massimiliano Rota</p>
            <p>We continue the study of the quantum marginal independence problem, namely the question of which faces of the subadditivity cone are achievable by quantum states. We introduce a new representation of the patterns of marginal independence (PMIs, corresponding to faces of the subadditivity cone) based on certain correlation hypergraphs, and demonstrate that this representation provides a more efficient description of a PMI, and consequently of the set of PMIs which are compatible with strong subadditivity. We then show that these correlation hypergraphs generalize to arbitrary quantum systems the well known relation between positivity of mutual information and connectivity of entanglement wedges in holography, and further use this representation to derive new results about the combinatorial structure of collections of simultaneously decorrelated subsystems specifying SSA-compatible PMIs. In the context of holography, we apply these techniques to derive a necessary condition for the realizability of entropy vectors by simple tree graph models, which were conjectured in arXiv:2204.00075 to provide the building blocks of the holographic entropy cone. Since this necessary condition is formulated in terms of chordality of a certain graph, it can be tested efficiently.</p>

            <h2>The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi "Gravity from entropy", Phys. Rev. D (2025) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small curvature limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.</p>

            <p>We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincaré AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</p>

            <h2>Reed-Muller Codes on CQ Channels via a New Correlation Bound for Quantum Observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avijit Mandal, Henry D. Pfister</p>
            <p>The question of whether Reed-Muller (RM) codes achieve capacity on binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels has drawn attention since it was resolved positively for the binary erasure channel by Kudekar et al. in 2016. In 2021, Reeves and Pfister extended this to prove the bit-error probability vanishes on BMS channels when the code rate is less than capacity. In 2023, Abbe and Sandon improved this to show the block-error probability also goes to zero. These results analyze decoding functions using symmetry and the nested structure of RM codes. In this work, we focus on binary-input symmetric classical-quantum (BSCQ) channels and the Holevo capacity. For a BSCQ, we consider observables that estimate the channel input in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE). Using the orthogonal decomposition of these observables under a weighted inner product, we establish a recursive relation for the minimum MSE estimate of a single bit in the RM code. Our results show that any set of $2^{o(\sqrt{\log N})}$ bits can be decoded with a high probability when the code rate is less than the Holevo capacity.</p>

            <p>Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</p>

            <h2>Towards Accurate Mixed Quantum Classical Simulations of Vibrational Polaritonic Chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad R. Hasyim, Arkajit Mandal, David R. Reichman</p>
            <p>Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seoyeon Yang, Danbi Kim, Hansol Jeong, Han Seb Moon</p>
            <p>Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has garnered significant attention for its potential to enable security-loophole-free quantum communication. Successful MDI-QKD protocols rely on performing a two-photon Bell-state measurement at an intermediate node, with a high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference pattern between two independent coherent photons being crucial. In this study, we present a novel approach for developing indistinguishable coherent photon sources over 50 km of optical fiber in a real-world setting. We introduce the long optical injection-locking (long-OIL) technique, which enables frequency locking between two long-distance coherent photons beyond the coherence length of the master laser. Using the long-OIL technique, we achieved time-resolved HOM interference with a visibility of 48(2)%, approaching the theoretical 50% limit for two independent continuous-wave coherent photons. Our results demonstrate that the long-OIL platform is a promising solution for MDI-QKD with repeaterless secret key capacity.</p>

            <p>Entanglement has the ability to enhance the transmission of classical information over a quantum channel. However, fully harvesting this advantage typically requires complex entangling measurements, which are challenging to implement and scale with the system's size. In this work, we consider a natural quantum information primitive in which the message to be communicated is selected stochastically. We introduce a protocol that leverages high-dimensional entanglement to perform this task perfectly, without requiring quantum interference between particles at the measurement station. We experimentally demonstrate the protocol's scalability in an optical setup using 8-dimensional entanglement and multi-outcome detection, providing a practical solution for stochastic communication and a robust method for certifying the dimensionality of entanglement in communication experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshai T. Krishnan, Kanad Sengupta, S. P. Dinesh, C. M. Chandrashekar</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation enables a way to transmit an arbitrary qubit state from one place to an other. A standard scheme for teleportation in optical setup involve three photons, an entangled photon pair and a photon carrying quantum state to be teleported. The interaction between the photons in the scheme makes quantum teleportation probabilistic. Here we demonstrate a deterministic teleportation of an arbitrary qubit state using only a polarization entangled photon pair in a linear optical setup. By introducing the path degree of freedom to one of the entangled photon and encoding the arbitrary qubit state into it, we demonstrate 100\% Bell State Measurement (BSM) outcome. This enables a deterministic teleportation of a qubit state in an optical scheme with high fidelity. We report an average teleportation fidelity of 88.00%. The dependency of fidelity on the visibility of single-photon interferometer used for path qubit state shows the possibility of further improving the fidelity of quantum teleportation.</p>

            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <p>Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</p>

The modulations form a stripe pattern that grows exponentially with time until the local Chern marker reaches unity. The alternating QAH order defines a domain structure with boundaries that host chiral sublattice currents.</p>

            <p>Single-photon source is the cornerstone for modern quantum information processing. The present work derives the theoretical limit of single-photon purity for general parametric heralded single-photon sources, and subsequently demonstrates a bright, gigahertz-pulsed heralded source with the purity saturating the limit. By stimulating spontaneous four-wave mixing effect in the silicon spiral waveguide, this on-chip source is measured to have a coincidence rate exceeding 1.5~MHz at a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) of 16.77 in the photon pair correlation experiment. The single-photon purity of this source, quantified by the heralded auto-correlation function $g^{(2)}_\text{h}(0)$, is measured by a heralded Hanbury Brown--Twiss setup to reach the theoretical limit with the lowest value of $0.00094 \pm 0.00002$ obtained at a coincidence rate of 0.8~kHz and a CAR of 2220. The performance improvements are attributed to effective spectral filtering suppressing the noise as well as the coherent pump condition helped by optical injection locking. The reported results provide a reliable standard for benchmarking heralded single-photon sources and present a state-of-the-art heralded source for quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hong Liu, Xian-Li Yin, Hui Jing, Le-Man Kuang, Jie-Qiao Liao</p>
            <p>Chiral quantum state generation is an interesting topic in quantum physics and quantum information science. Here we propose an approach for generating chiral cat states in a spinning resonator supporting both the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) traveling modes, which are dispersively coupled to a two-level atom. The physical mechanism for the chiral-cat-state generation is based on the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. Concretely, when the resonator is rotating, the CW and CCW modes have different frequency detuning with respect to the atomic transition frequency and hence the atomic-state-dependent rotating angular velocities for the CW and CCW modes in phase space are different. This mode-dependent evolution leads to a chirality mechanism in the state generation. Based on the mode-dependent conditional rotation evolution and atomic projection measurement at proper time, we achieve the separate generation of cat states in the CW mode and coherent states in the CCW mode. We also investigate quantum coherence properties of the generated states by examining their Wigner functions. In addition, the influence of the system dissipations on the state generation in the open-system case is investigated. Our work will provide some insights into the development of chiral optical devices and nonreciprocal photonics.</p>

            <p>In quantum mechanics, the time evolution of particles is given by the Schrödinger equation. It is valid in a nonrelativistic regime where the interactions with the particle can be modelled by a potential and quantised fields are not required. This has been verified in countless experiments when the interaction is of electromagnetic origin, but also corrections due to the quantised field are readily observed. When the interaction is due to gravity, then one cannot expect to see effects of the quantised field in current-technology Earth-bound experiments. However, this does not yet guarantee that in the accessible regime, the time evolution is accurately given by the Schrödinger equation. Here we propose to measure the effects of an asymmetric mass configuration on a quantum particle in an interferometer. For this setup we show that with parameters within experimental reach, one can be sensitive to possible deviations from the Schrödinger equation, beyond the already verified lowest-order regime. Performing this experiment will hence directly test the nonclassical behaviour of a quantum particle in the gravitational field.</p>

            <p>The dynamical preparation of exotic many-body quantum states is a persistent goal of analog quantum simulation, often limited by experimental coherence times. Recently, it was shown that fast, non-adiabatic Hamiltonian parameter sweeps can create finite-size ``lakes'' of quantum order in certain settings, independent of what is present in the ground state phase diagram. Here, we show that going further out of equilibrium via external driving can substantially accelerate the preparation of these quantum lakes. Concretely, when lakes can be prepared, existing counterdiabatic driving techniques -- originally designed to target the ground state -- instead naturally target the lakes state. We demonstrate this both for an illustrative single qutrit and a model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Rydberg quantum spin liquid. In the latter case, we construct experimental drive sequences that accelerate preparation by almost an order of magnitude at fixed laser power. We conclude by using a Landau-Ginzburg model to provide a semi-classical picture for how our method accelerates state preparation.</p>

            <p>Quantum communication rates in terrestrial quantum networks are fundamentally limited by fibre loss, even in the presence of quantum repeaters. Satellites offer a solution for long-distance communication, with the most commonly explored scenario involving prepare-and-measure protocols connecting from orbit to a trusted-node ground station via free-space down-links. In contrast, up-link scenarios allow for entanglement to be distributed between a satellite and remote end users in terrestrial networks, eliminating any trust requirement on the ground station. Here we demonstrate an ultra-bright source of far-non-degenerate entangled photons and perform quantum key distribution in emulated high-loss satellite scenarios. With a loss profile corresponding to that of one of the pioneering Micius up-link experiments, and a terrestrial end user separated by 10~km of telecom fibre we achieve secure key bit accumulation of 5.2~kbit in a single emulated overpass in the asymptotic limit.

            <p>Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</p>

            <p>Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement across more than one degree of freedom (DoF), is a valuable resource in photonic quantum information technology. However, the lack of efficient characterization schemes hinders its quantitative study and application potential. Here, we present a rapid quantitative characterization of spatial-polarization hyperentangled biphoton state produced from spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We first demonstrate rapid certification of the hyperentanglement dimensionality with a cumulative acquisition time of only 17 minutes. In particular, we verify transverse spatial entanglement through a violation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion with a minimum conditional uncertainty product of $(0.11\pm0.05)\hbar$ and certify the entanglement dimensionality to be at least 148. Next, by performing spatially-resolved polarization state tomography of the entire field, we demonstrate the generation of an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303\pm0.0004$. Together, the results reveal a total dimensionality of at least 251, which is the highest dimensionality reported for hyperentanglement. These measurements quantitatively resolve the influence of the spatial correlations of the down-converted photons and the angular spectrum of the pump beam on the polarization entanglement. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the high dimensionality and cross-DoF correlations in hyperentangled states for future quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We report an enhanced sensitivity for detecting linear perturbations near hybrid (doubly degenerated) exceptional-diabolic (HED) singular points in a four mode bosonic system. The sensitivity enhancement is attributed to a singular response function, with the pole order determining the scaling of estimation error. At HED singular points, the error scaling exhibits a twofold improvement over non-HED singular points. The ultimate bound on estimation error is derived via quantum Fisher information, with heterodyne detection identified as the measurement achieving this optimal scaling.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinearity and Quantumness in Thermodynamics: From Principles to Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gershon Kurizki, Nilakantha Meher, Tomáš Opatrný</p>
            <p>The impact of quantum mechanics on thermodynamics, particularly on the principles and designs of heat machines (HM), has been limited by the incompatibility of quantum coherent evolution with the dissipative, open-system nature of all existing HM and their basic structure, which has not been radically changed since Carnot. We have recently proposed a paradigm change whereby conventional HM functionality is replaced by that of few-mode coherent, closed systems with nonlinear, e.g. cross-Kerr, inter-mode couplings. These couplings allow us to coherently filter incident thermal noise, transforming it into a resource of work and information. Current technological advances enable heat engines, noise sensors or microscopes based on such designs to operate with thermal noise sources of few photons. This paradigm shift opens a path towards radically new understanding and exploitation of the relation between coherent, quantum or classical, evolution and thermodynamic behavior.</p>

            <h2>Optical interference by amplitude measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunxiao Zhang, Xuan Tang, Xueshi Guo, Liang Cui, Xiaoying Li, Z. Y. Ou</p>
            <p>Interference effects are usually observed by intensity measurement. Path indistinguishability by quantum complementarity principle requires projection of the interfering fields into a common indistinguishable mode before detection. On the other hand, the essence of wave interference is the addition of amplitudes of the interfering fields. Therefore, if amplitudes can be directly measured and added, interference can occur even though the interfering fields are in well-distinguishable modes. Here, we make a comprehensive study in both theory and experiment of a technique by homodyne measurement of field amplitudes to reveal interference. This works for both classical and quantum fields even though there exists distinguishability in the interfering paths of light. This directly challenges complementarity principle. We present a resolution of this issue from the viewpoint of measurement that emphasizes either particle or wave. This technique is particularly useful for recovering interference in unbalanced interferometers with path-imbalance beyond coherence length of the input field and can be applied to remote sensing to extend applicable range. Since the amplitude-based interference phenomena studied here are fundamentally different from the traditional intenisty-based interference phenomena, our approach leads to a new paradigm to study coherence between optical fields.</p>

The coupling is implemented using tightly focused optical tweezers on each ion that change the local trapping potential in a state-dependent way. By encoding spins in the internal states of the ions and adding a tunneling term via Mølmer-Sørensen-type interactions, we calculate the emergence of mobile bipolarons driven by the zero-point energy of the ion crystal phonons. We show that thermal occupation may pin the bipolarons for ion crystals at finite temperature. Our scheme can be used to study and illustrate the emergence of mobile bipolarons as a function of temperature.</p>

Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniruddha Bhattacharya, Chandra Raman</p>
            <p>Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, "volume-law" states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Crucially, we generalize this approach to demonstrate the potentiality of deterministically entangling two arbitrarily high, $N$-dimensional quantum systems, by formally establishing a deep connection between the matrix representations of the unitary quantum holonomy--within energy-degenerate subspaces in which the total excitation number is conserved--and the $\left(2j+1\right)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation operator, where $j = \left(N-1\right)/2$ and $N \geq 2$. Specifically, our protocol deterministically entangles spatially localized modes that are not only distinguishable but are also individually accessible and amenable to state preparation and measurement, and therefore, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for deterministic quantum information processing with light.</p>

We develop a polaron master equation theory for incorporating the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling and investigate the role of phonon-mediated processes and phonon-bath temperature on the degree of entanglement. We show that the phonon-coupling introduces the one-photon and two-photon incoherent processes, as well as the cross-coupling between the two exciton states. It is shown that the phonon-mediated coupling along with the ac-Stark shift and multiphoton emission significantly degrade the entanglement at higher temperatures.

            <p>The interplay between thermodynamics, general relativity and quantum mechanics has long intrigued researchers. Recently, important advances have been obtained in thermodynamics, mainly regarding its application to the quantum domain through fluctuation theorems.

We demonstrate how the spacetime curvature can produce entropy in a localized quantum system moving in a general spacetime. The example of a quantum harmonic oscillator living in an expanding universe is presented. This result implies that entropy production is strongly observer dependent and deeply connects the arrow of time with the causal structure of the spacetime.</p>

            <p>The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Optomechanical systems subjected to environmental noise give rise to rich physical phenomena. We investigate entanglement between a mechanical oscillator and the reflected coherent optical field in a general, not necessarily Markovian environment. For the input optical field, we consider stationary Gaussian states and frequency dependent squeezing. We demonstrate that for a coherent laser drive, either unsqueezed or squeezed in a frequency-independent manner, optomechanical entanglement is destroyed after a threshold that depends only on the environmental noises -- independent of the coherent coupling between the oscillator and the optical field, or the squeeze factor. In this way, we have found a universal entangling-disentangling transition. We also show that for a configuration in which the oscillator and the reflected field are separable, entanglement cannot be generated by incorporating frequency-dependent squeezing in the optical field.</p>

            <p>Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Theory of Polariton Group Velocity Renormalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxiang Ying, Benjamin X. K. Chng, Milan Delor, Pengfei Huo</p>
            <p>Cavity exciton-polaritons exhibit ballistic transport and can achieve a distance of 100 $\mu $m in one picosecond. This ballistic transport significantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often move diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer devices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations, there is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of polariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while still preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a finite-temperature Green's function approach. Utilizing the generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for the group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by phonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton (LP) states to the dark states, then scattering from dark states back to LP. The dark states do not have to be populated in this process, serving as the virtual state for super-exchange (especially true for a large light-matter detuning). The theory predicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly with the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions (perturbative regime for exciton-phonon coupling) and also linearly depends on the temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are numerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations, demonstrating quantitative agreement. Our findings provide theoretical insights and a predictive analytical framework that advance the understanding and design of cavity-modified semiconductors and molecular ensembles, opening new avenues for engineered polaritonic devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are infamously known for their high demand on hardware, their extremely low key generation rates and their lack of security resulting from a need for trusted nodes which is implied by the absence of quantum repeaters. While they theoretically offer unlimited security, they are therefore practically limited in several regards. In this work we focus on the lack of options to guarantee an end-to-end security service with the currently available technology and infrastructure and propose a novel protocol. We find that one of the stumbling stones on the path towards an end-to-end security service guaranteed by quantum key distribution may be removed by using this protocol. Our proposal combines several parallel instances of twinfield QKD followed by classical postprocessing and communication to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret key. This hybrid approach improves the key rate and range w.r.t. to previous QKD approaches at a contained cost in security. We show that a coalition of intermediary nodes between Alice and Bob is needed to break the new scheme, sharply outperforming the trusted node approach in terms of security. Furthermore, the protocols do not require complex quantum measurements on Alice and Bob's sides, thus being truly end-to-end.</p>

            <p>The objective to be minimized in the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has a restricted form, which allows a specialized sequential minimal optimization (SMO) that requires only a few observations in each iteration. However, the SMO iteration is still costly due to the observation noise -- one observation at a point typically requires averaging over hundreds to thousands of repeated quantum measurement shots for achieving a reasonable noise level. In this paper, we propose an adaptive cost control method, named subspace in confident region (SubsCoRe), for SMO. SubsCoRe uses the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate, and requires it to have low uncertainty over the subspace being updated, so that optimization in each iteration is performed with guaranteed accuracy. The adaptive cost control is performed by first setting the required accuracy according to the progress of the optimization, and then choosing the minimum number of measurement shots and their distribution such that the required accuracy is satisfied. We demonstrate that SubsCoRe significantly improves the efficiency of SMO, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of estimating the energy of a quantum state preparation for a given Hamiltonian in Pauli decomposition. For various quantum algorithms, in particular in the context of quantum chemistry, it is crucial to have energy estimates with error bounds, as captured by guarantees on the problem's sampling complexity. In particular, when limited to Pauli basis measurements, the smallest sampling complexity guarantee comes from a simple single-shot estimator via a straightforward argument based on Hoeffding's inequality. In this work, we construct an adaptive estimator using the state's actual variance. Technically, our estimation method is based on the Empirical Bernstein stopping (EBS) algorithm and grouping schemes, and we provide a rigorous tail bound, which leverages the state's empirical variance. In a numerical benchmark of estimating ground-state energies of several Hamiltonians, we demonstrate that EBS consistently improves upon elementary readout guarantees up to one order of magnitude.</p>

Our approach bridges the complexity gap by enabling the computation of the permanent -- central to Boson Sampling -- with the same computational complexity as the best known classical algorithm based on a graphical representation of the operator-basis MPS that we introduce. Furthermore, we exploit the flexibility of tensor networks to extend our formalism to incorporate partial distinguishability and photon loss, two key imperfections in practical interferometry experiments.

            <p>Solid-state quantum sensors based on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as powerful tools for precise sensing applications. Nuclear spin sensors are particularly well-suited for applications requiring long coherence times, such as inertial sensing, but remain underexplored due to control complexity and limited optical readout efficiency. In this work, we propose cooperative cavity quantum electrodynamic (cQED) coupling to achieve efficient nuclear spin readout. Unlike previous cQED methods used to enhance electron spin readout, here we employ two-field interference in the NV hyperfine subspace to directly probe the nuclear spin transitions. We model the nuclear spin NV-cQED system (nNV-cQED) and observe several distinct regimes, including electromagnetically induced transparency, masing without inversion, and oscillatory behavior. We then evaluate the nNV-cQED system as an inertial sensor, indicating a rotation sensitivity improved by three orders of magnitude compared to previous solid-state spin demonstrations. Furthermore, we show that the NV electron spin can be simultaneously used as a comagnetometer, and the four crystallographic axes of NVs can be employed for vector resolution in a single nNV-cQED system. These results showcase the applications of two-field interference using the nNV-cQED platform, providing critical insights into the manipulation and control of quantum states in hybrid NV systems and unlocking new possibilities for high-performance quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the microscopic behaviour of materials and chemical processes by enabling high-accuracy electronic structure calculations to scale more efficiently than is possible using classical computers. Current quantum computing hardware devices suffer from the dual challenges of noise and cost, which raises the question of what practical value these devices might offer before full fault tolerance is achieved and economies of scale enable cheaper access. Here we examine the practical value of noisy quantum computers as tools for high-accuracy electronic structure, by using a Quantinuum ion-trap quantum computer to predict the ionisation potential of helium. By combining a series of techniques suited for use with current hardware including qubit-efficient encoding coupled with chemical insight, low-cost variational optimisation with hardware-adapted quantum circuits, and moments-based corrections, we obtain an ionisation potential of 24.5536 (+0.0011, -0.0005) eV, which agrees with the experimentally measured value to within true chemical accuracy, and with high statistical confidence. The methods employed here can be generalised to predict other properties and expand our understanding of the value that might be provided by near-term quantum computers.</p>

Lett. 100, 073601 (2008)) by using SMSV state with squeezing <10 dB from which a certain number of photons was initially subtracted. The gain sensitivity is also observed when measuring the difference of output intensities of the SMSV state with squeezing <3 dB from which 2,4,6 photons are subtracted and large coherent state. Overall, subtracting photons from the initially weakly squeezed light can prove to be a more efficient strategy in the quantum MZ interferometry compared to highly squeezed SMSV state generation.</p>

            <p>An ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond can act as a precise quantum sensor even under ambient conditions. In particular, to optimize thier sensitivity, it is crucial to increase the number of spins sampled and maximize their coupling to the detection system, without degrading their spin properties. In this paper, we demonstrate enhanced quantum magnetometry via a high-quality buried laser-written waveguide in diamond with a 4.5 ppm density of nitrogen-vacancy centers. We show that the waveguide-coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers exhibit comparable spin coherence properties as that of nitrogen-vacancy centers in pristine diamond using time-domain optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Waveguide-enhanced magnetic field sensing is demonstrated in a fiber-coupled integrated photonic chip, where probing an increased volume of high-density spins results in 63 this http URL$^{-1/2}$ of DC-magnetic field sensitivity and 20 this http URL$^{-1/2}$ of AC magnetic field sensitivity. This on-chip sensor realizes at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the conventional confocal detection setup, paving the way for microscale sensing with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrunal Kamble, Evan Humberd, Tian Li, Girish S. Agarwal</p>
            <p>Analyzing the kinetics of biological processes plays a significant role in understanding fundamental cellular functions. Many physics-based technologies used to study such processes are limited by the shot noise inherent to the coherent states of light. These technologies can greatly benefit by leveraging quantum probes to improve the sensitivity of measurements in cellular biology. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique has been used effectively to achieve label-free, real-time measurements of protein binding kinetics, which constitutes an important biological phenomenon occurring near the cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate the integration of this technique with the two-mode bright squeezed state having fewer fluctuations as compared to the coherent state to improve the sensitivity of measurement in studying a protein-gold adsorption process. We show 4dB of squeezing as we record the signal-to-noise ratio as the function of time and it is maintained throughout the kinetic process. The quantum advantage as shown in terms of squeezing is achieved despite the total absorption of 74% from the source until the final detection after the sensor. Overall, we provide the most practical setup for improving the sensitivity of the time-dependent measurements involved in various biological processes at the molecular level.</p>

            <h2>Quantum coherence and the invisible Universe: Subradiance as a dark matter mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Houde, Fereshteh Rajabi</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</p>

            <p>The Josephson effect characterizes superfluids and superconductors separated by a weak link, the so-called Josephson junction. A recent experiment has shown that Josephson oscillations can be observed also in a supersolid, where the weak link is not due to an external barrier, but is self-induced by interparticle interactions. Here we show theoretically that supersolids -- despite their self-induced character -- feature all the standard properties of bosonic Josephson junction arrays, including macroscopic quantum self-trapping. We focus on the harmonically trapped dipolar supersolids of interest for current experiments, and show that they can be described with a generalized Josephson model that takes into account spatial inhomogeneities. Our work shades new light on the dynamics of supersolids and opens the way to the study of a novel class of Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p>We introduce Super Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization. In its simplest form, SQM considers states in the form of unitary operators, where the quadratic constraints are conditions of unitarity. In this case, the stationary SQM problem is a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers the evolution of a quantum system, distinct from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Several options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered, and quantum circuits of 2D type are introduced, which transform one quantum system into another. Although no known physical process currently describes such dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithm. Beyond computer modeling, the developed theory could be directly applied if or when a physical process capable of solving an inverse quantum problem in a single measurement act (analogous to wavefunction measurement in traditional quantum mechanics) is discovered in the future.</p>

            <p>We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically, which we refer to as the quantum-to-classical transition. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, stating that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.</p>

            <h2>Extended analysis of distillation and purification of squeezed states of light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaromír Fiurášek, Stephan Grebien, Roman Schnabel</p>
            <p>Squeezed states of light are one of the most important fundamental resources for quantum optics, optical quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that the squeezing of single-mode squeezed vacuum states can be enhanced by probabilistic two-photon subtraction. A further enhancement of the squeezing is subsequently possible by heralded Gaussification that distills a Gaussian state from the de-Gaussified two-photon subtracted state. Here we provide an extended theoretical analysis of squeezing distillation and purification. We consider a more general scheme in which photon subtraction is combined with a weak coherent displacement. This more flexible scheme allows to enhance squeezing for arbitrary input squeezing value. Moreover, if the modified two-photon subtraction operation is properly chosen, then arbitrary strong squeezing can be distilled by subsequent Gaussification. We go beyond pure states and show that the combination of photon subtraction and heralded Gaussification cannot suppress losses that have affected the input state. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative de-Gaussifying operation based on a Fock-state filter that removes the single-photon state. With this de-Gaussifying operation and subsequent re-Gaussification, pure single-mode squeezed states can be distilled from a large class of mixed input states. Interestingly, we have found that squeezing distillation by two-photon subtraction is closely related to certain methods for generating Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, which are crucial for optical quantum computing.</p>

An unbalanced interferometer embedding electro-optic modulators, which is stabilized by exploiting the continuous energy-time entanglement of the generated photon pairs, controls time and frequency-bin modes. We measure 144 collision-free events with 4 photons at the output, achieving a fidelity >0.98 with the theoretical probability distribution. We use this result to identify the similarity between families of isomorphic graphs with 6 vertices, and present an approach for the realization of universal operations on time-frequency modes.</p>

We further assess the quality of the shared entangled state in the information processing task of quantum teleportation of an unknown polarization qubit. Our results with realistic devices, embedding detection inefficiency and transmission losses, indicate the viability of faithful quantum teleportation over large distances, conforming with the quality of the shared correlation.</p>

            <p>Entangled states of photons form the backbone of many quantum technologies. Due to the lack of effective photon-photon interactions, the generation of these states is typically probabilistic. In the prevailing but fundamentally limited generation technique, known as postselection, the target photons are measured destructively in the generation process. By contrast, in the alternative approach -- heralded state generation -- the successful creation of a desired state is verified by the detection of ancillary photons. Heralded state generation is superior to postselection in several critical ways: It enables free usage of the prepared states, allows for the success probability to be arbitrarily increased via multiplexing, and provides a scalable route to quantum information processing using photons. Here, we review theoretical proposals and experimental realizations of heralded entangled photonic state generation, as well as the impact of realistic experimental errors. We then discuss the wide-ranging applications of these states for quantum technologies, including resource states in linear optical quantum computing, entanglement swapping for repeater networks, fundamental physics, and quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Near-deterministic photon entanglement from a spin qudit in silicon using third quantisation</h2>

            <p>Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Ensembles of dipolar emitters which couple collectively to the radiation field display sub- and superradiance. These terms refer to a reduction or an enhancement of photon emission rates due to the interference of emission channels. Arrays of trapped neutral atoms constitute a promising platform for harnessing this phenomenon in technological applications, e.g. for excitation storage, single-photon switches and mirrors. However, vibrational motion of the atoms within their traps leads to position fluctuations that entangle the motion and the internal atomic degrees of freedom, which is expected to affect the collective photon emission. We develop here a theory for collective atom-light coupling in the presence of this quantized motion within the Lamb-Dicke limit. We show the existence of sub- and superradiant states, which are hybrids of electronic and vibrational excitations and explore their properties for analytically and numerically efficiently solvable cases.</p>

Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions.

            <p>The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We investigate the universal fluctuations of localized wavefunction in the Fock space of two interacting particles in one-dimensional disordered systems, focusing on the interplay between random potentials and random long-range interactions. By mapping the system onto a directed polymer problem, we show that random potentials alone produce correlated energies for the sites in the Fock space, giving rise to the fluctuation growth exponent 1/2. Introducing random long-range interactions alters these correlations and drives the system's fluctuations into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in (1+1)D with the exponent 1/3. To validate the universality of the observed fluctuation scaling, we study a complex directed polymer model with competing point and columnar disorder. Our results confirm that columnar disorder corresponds to on-site energies in the Fock space from the random potentials, while point disorder models the effects of random long-range interactions between the two particles. These findings provide new insights into the Fock-space perspective for examining disordered quantum many-body systems, and emphasize the critical role of disorder structure in determining the universality class of fluctuations in localized quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The superposition principle provides us the opportunity to unfold many surprising facts. One such fact leads to the generation of entanglement which may allow one to teleport an unknown quantum state from one location to another. We try to understand the role of superposition in the process of quantum teleportation. We consider, within the scenario of quantum teleportation, a set-up where the sender and the receiver are in a superposed situation of using a maximally entangled state and not using any entangled state in the teleportation protocol, controlled by a qubit. We address two distinct protocols: in the first case, the sender and the receiver do nothing when they do not have the authority to use entanglement, while in the second case, they still use classical communication even if they do not use entanglement. After accomplishing the protocols, we operate a Hadamard gate on the control qubit, measure the control qubit's state, and consider the outcome corresponding to a particular state of the control. We compare the protocol's fidelity with the maximum fidelity achievable through classical resources only. In particular, we provide conditions to achieve nonclassical fidelity in teleportation, in the presence of the control qubit. To explore if there is any quantum advantage (advantage of superposition present in the control qubit), we compare the fidelities of the control qubit-based protocols with the fidelity achieved in a situation where the two parties are in a classical mixture of using and not using the maximally entangled state. We observe that there exists a wide range of parameters defining the initial state of the control qubit for which our protocols provide quantum advantage. To analyse the role of superposition quantitatively, we discuss whether the amount of quantum advantage can be expressed in terms of quantum coherence present in the state of the control qubit.</p>

            <p>Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, and CO$_2$, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.</p>

            <p>The number of excitations in a large quantum system (harmonic oscillator or qudit) can be measured in a quantum nondemolition manner using a dispersively coupled qubit. It typically requires a series of qubit pulses that encode various binary questions about the photon number. Recently, a method based on the fluorescence measurement of a qubit driven by a train of identical pulses was introduced to track the photon number in a cavity, hence simplifying its monitoring and raising interesting questions about the measurement backaction of this scheme. A first realization with superconducting circuits demonstrated how the average number of photons could be measured in this way. Here we present an experiment that reaches single-shot photocounting and number tracking owing to a cavity decay rate 4 orders of magnitude smaller than both the dispersive coupling rate and the qubit emission rate. An innovative notch filter and pogo-pin-based galvanic contact makes possible these seemingly incompatible features. The qubit dynamics under the pulse train is characterized. We observe quantum jumps by monitoring the photon number via the qubit fluorescence as photons leave the cavity one at a time. Additionally, we extract the measurement rate and induced dephasing rate and compare them to theoretical models. Our method could be applied to quantum error correction protocols on bosonic codes or qudits.</p>

This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of quantum mechanics was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s. This work argues in favor of the latter position. In particular, it shows how to construct a mathematically rigorous theory for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, which is based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables. Though this theory is provably distinct from its quantum mechanical analog, it nonetheless reproduces central predictions of the latter. Further work may make an empirical comparison possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models. Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huai-Ming Yu, Jing Liu</p>
            <p>As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce this http URL, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4, 043057 (2022)]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Hamiltonian encoding algorithms for extracting quantum control mechanism as interfering pathway amplitudes in the Dyson series</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erez Abrams, Michael Kasprzak, Gaurav Bhole, Tak-San Ho, Herschel Rabitz</p>
            <p>Hamiltonian encoding is a methodology for revealing the mechanism behind the dynamics governing controlled quantum systems. In this paper, following Mitra and Rabitz [Phys. Rev. A 67, 033407 (2003)], we define mechanism via pathways of eigenstates that describe the evolution of the system, where each pathway is associated with a complex-valued amplitude corresponding to a term in the Dyson series. The evolution of the system is determined by the constructive and destructive interference of these pathway amplitudes. Pathways with similar attributes can be grouped together into pathway classes. The amplitudes of pathway classes are computed by modulating the Hamiltonian matrix elements and decoding the subsequent evolution of the system rather than by direct computation of the individual terms in the Dyson series. The original implementation of Hamiltonian encoding was computationally intensive and became prohibitively expensive in large quantum systems. This paper presents two new encoding algorithms that calculate the amplitudes of pathway classes by using techniques from graph theory and algebraic topology to exploit patterns in the set of allowed transitions, greatly reducing the number of matrix elements that need to be modulated. These new algorithms provide an exponential decrease in both computation time and memory utilization with respect to the Hilbert space dimension of the system. To demonstrate the use of these techniques, they are applied to two illustrative state-to-state transition problems.</p>

            <h2>Readout Error Mitigation for Mid-Circuit Measurements and Feedforward</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Ming Koh, Dax Enshan Koh, Jayne Thompson</p>
            <p>Current quantum computing platforms suffer from readout errors, where faulty measurement outcomes are reported by the device. These errors are particularly harmful in quantum programs that rely on branch statements wherein operations in later parts of the program are dynamically determined by mid-circuit measurements. We propose a general protocol for mitigating mid-circuit measurement errors in the presence of feedforward, offering an efficient solution that works for any number of feedforward layers without increasing circuit depth or two-qubit gate counts, making it highly suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our method demonstrates up to a ${\sim} 60\%$ reduction in error on superconducting quantum processors across several practically relevant feedforward circuits, including dynamic qubit resets, shallow-depth GHZ state preparation, and multi-stage quantum teleportation. This work paves the way for more resilient adaptive quantum circuits, crucial for both current and future quantum computing applications.</p>

            <p>Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</p>

Interestingly, the region corresponding to nonlocality generating channels shrinks as their stationary state departs from the maximally mixed state. Finally, we demonstrate special cases, where nonlocality can be fully characterized via as little as a single parameter. This approach significantly simplifies the analysis of nonlocality for the X states.</p>

We measure a qubit frequency of 2.9 GHz, an energy relaxation time with a median of 425 us and a maximum of (666 +/- 33) us, and an echo dephasing time with a median of 541 us and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138) us.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolyn Zhang, Yichen Xu, Jian-Hao Zhang, Cenke Xu, Zhen Bi, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</p>

We assess the role that the microscopic interactions within the system play, establishing that for the all-to-all model the introduction of temperature leads to a melting of the emergent time periodicity, in contrast to stable long-time behavior which can be maintained for nearest neighbor $XXZ$ type interactions.</p>

            <p>Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing promises to solve problems previously deemed infeasible. However, high error rates necessitate quantum error correction for practical applications. Seminal experiments with zoned neutral atom architectures have shown remarkable potential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To fully harness their potential, efficient software solutions are vital. A key aspect of quantum error correction is the initialization of physical qubits representing a logical qubit in a highly entangled state. This process, known as state preparation, is the foundation of most quantum error correction codes and, hence, a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generating a schedule of target-specific instructions to perform the state preparation is highly complex. First software tools exist but are not suitable for the zoned neutral atom architectures. This work addresses this gap by leveraging the computational power of SMT solvers and generating minimal schedules for the state preparation of logical arrays. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that actively utilizing zones to shield idling qubits consistently results in higher fidelities than solutions disregarding these zones.

            <p>Most security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) assume that there is no unwanted information leakage about the state preparation process. However, this assumption is impossible to guarantee in practice, as QKD systems can leak information to the channel due to device imperfections or the active action of an eavesdropper. Here, we solve this pressing issue by introducing a security proof in the presence of information leakage from all state preparation settings for arguably the most popular QKD scheme, namely the decoy-state BB84 protocol. The proof requires minimal experimental characterization, as only a single parameter related to the isolation of the source needs to be determined, thus providing a clear path for bridging the gap between theory and practice. Moreover, if information about the state of the side channels is available, this can be readily incorporated into the analysis to further improve the resulting performance.</p>

Here we experimentally realize the three-user MDIQCC protocol with four-intensity decoy-state method, in which we employ the polarization encoding and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state projection measurement. Our work demonstrates the experimental feasibility of the MDI QCC, which lays the foundation for the future realization of quantum networks with multipartite communication tasks.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating linear, anti-Hermitian (lossless) wave equations in heterogeneous, anisotropic, and time-independent media. This framework encompasses a broad class of wave equations, including the acoustic wave equation, Maxwell$'$s equations and the elastic wave equation. Our formulation is compatible with standard numerical discretization schemes and allows for the efficient implementation of multiple practically relevant time- and space-dependent sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that subspace energies can be extracted and wave fields compared through an $l_2$ loss function, achieving optimal precision scaling with the number of samples taken. Additionally, we introduce techniques for incorporating boundary conditions and linear constraints that preserve the anti-Hermitian nature of the equations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian simulation algorithm, our framework achieves a quartic speed-up over classical solvers in 3D simulations, under conditions of sufficiently global measurements and compactly supported sources and initial conditions. This quartic speed-up is optimal for time-domain solutions, as the Hamiltonian of the discretized wave equations has local couplings. In summary, our framework provides a versatile approach for simulating wave equations on quantum computers, offering substantial speed-ups over state-of-the-art classical methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Hua Yu</p>
            <p>We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates through free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to a detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We consider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of the wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the detection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the slits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function evolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the vertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an approximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the function characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows wider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally collapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope of this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits. Hence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the Schroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is narrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit, where it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is lost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase information, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the y-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on the counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe the process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show this function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is closely related to the wave function.</p>

            <p>We study the emergence of complexity in deep random $N$-qubit $T$-gate doped Clifford circuits, as reflected in their spectral properties and in magic generation, characterized by the stabilizer Rényi entropy distribution and the non-stabilizing power of the circuit. For pure (undoped) Clifford circuits, a unique periodic orbit structure in the space of Pauli strings implies peculiar spectral correlations and level statistics with large degeneracies. $T$-gate doping induces an exponentially fast transition to chaotic behavior, described by random matrix theory. We compare these complexity indicators with magic generation properties of the Clifford+$T$ ensemble, and determine the distribution of magic, as well as the average non-stabilizing power of the quantum circuit ensemble. In the dilute limit, $N_T \ll N$, magic generation is governed by single-qubit behavior. Magic is generated in approximate quanta, increases approximately linearly with the number of $T$-gates, $N_T$, and displays a discrete distribution for small $N_T$. At $N_T\approx N$, the distribution becomes quasi-continuous, and for $N_T\gg N$ it converges to that of Haar-random unitaries, and averages to a finite magic density, $m_2$, $\lim_{N\to\infty} \langle m_2 \rangle_\text{Haar} = 1$. This is in contrast to the spectral transition, where ${\cal O} (1)$ $T$-gates suffice to remove spectral degeneracies and to induce a transition to chaotic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. Magic is therefore a more sensitive indicator of complexity.</p>

            <p>``The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Carcassi, Calderón and Aidala (arXiv:2308.06669v3) is a thoughtful dissection of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics that seeks to pinpoint difficulties inherent in postulating that the physical states are elements of a Hilbert space. Its pivotal charge against Hilbert spaces is that by a change of variables, which is a change-of-basis unitary transformation, one ``can map states with finite expectation values to those with infinite ones''. In the present comment it is shown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the error is spotted. In consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes ``the expectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time" is also faulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces ``turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity'' is unsubstantiated. Two other objections to Hilbert spaces on physical grounds, both technically correct, are the isomorphism of separable Hilbert spaces and the unavoidable existence of infinite-expectation-value states. The former is of little relevance but the latter remains an issue without a fully satisfactory solution, although the evidence so far is that it is physically innocuous. All in all, while the authors' thesis that Hilbert spaces must be given up ought to be taken seriously, it seems insufficiently supported to be convincing.</p>

Specifically, we describe efficient methods using Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ and W states, establishing tighter bounds ($\approx \times 14.22$ for GHZ, $\approx \times 16$ for W) on the number of measurements required for desired precision.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as critical quantum resources in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth is dependent on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains unexplored. In this work, we study quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanics, realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer and a movable membrane. Such dissipative optomechanics allows to switch coherent and dissipative optomechanical coupling at will. With reliable parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power with coherent (dissipative) coupling. Further, we show that quantum entanglement generated by dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more noise-tolerant than that generated by coherent coupling. When both the coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously considered, entanglement is instead weakened due to quantum interference. Our result indicates that dissipative optomechanical coupling may be a promising path to engineer strong and noise-tolerant quantum entanglement.</p>

A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with Rényi divergences.</p>

            <h2>Cylindrically confined $H$ atom in magnetic field: variational cut-off factor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. N. Mendoza Tavera, H. Olivares-Pilón, M. Rodríguez-Arcos, A. M. Escobar-Ruiz</p>
            <p>In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,\hat{\bf z}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a \textit{perturbation}. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor $\big(1 - \big(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\big)^\nu\big)$, $\nu \geq 1$, appears to represent a significant improvement compared to the non-variational cut-off factors commonly employed in the literature. A phenomenon of a sharp change of $\nu-$behavior for small magnetic fields $B \lesssim 0.45\,a.u.$ with fixed radius $\rho_0 \approx 2\,a.u.$ is indicated. The dependence of the total energy $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ and the binding energy $E_b=E_b(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,a.u.$ and the magnetic field strength $B\in [0,\,1]\, a.u.$ is presented in detail. The expectation values $\langle \rho \rangle$ and $\langle|z| \rangle$, and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization. A brief discussion is provided comparing the 2D and 3D cases as well.</p>

            <h2>Weak convexity of Fisher information matrix and superresolved localization of blinking sources of light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitri B. Horoshko, Alexander B. Mikhalychev, Fedor Jelezko, Polina P. Kuzhir</p>
            <p>A group of techniques known by the general name of single-molecule localization microscopy reaches a nanometer-scale spatial resolution of point light emitters, well below the diffraction limit of the traditional microscopy. The key feature of these techniques is blinking, alternation of bright and dark states, of each emitter so that no more than one emitter is bright within the width of the point-spread function of the microscope during a time sufficient for its localization. We give a formulation of the optical part of these techniques in terms of quantum metrology, where the limit of precision is determined by the Fisher information on the emitters positions contained in the measurement data. We show that the advantage in resolution provided by making the emitters blink is a consequence of the fundamental property of Fisher information, its convexity. In particular, we prove the weak matrix convexity and the trace convexity of the Fisher information matrix -- two fundamental results in the multiparameter estimation theory. We show also that the advantage in information is inherent to the quantum state of light itself before the measurement and is related to the convexity of the quantum Fisher information matrix.</p>

            <h2>Chromatic Quantum Contextuality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Svozil</p>
            <p>Chromatic quantum contextuality is a criterion for quantum nonclassicality characterized by (hyper)graph coloring constraints. By examining the 3-uniform Yu-Oh hypergraph -- a configuration of quantum observables -- we prove its chromatic number exceeds the classical three-color limit. This result establishes chromatic contextuality as a distinct form of quantum nonclassicality, diverging from Kochen-Specker-type arguments that rely on the absence of two-valued states. Crucially, the Yu-Oh hypergraph exhibits this behavior even when separable two-valued states exist, demonstrating that chromatic contextuality operates independently of traditional noncontextuality violations. Our findings underscore hypergraph coloring as a powerful framework for identifying quantum signatures, enriching the understanding of contextuality beyond conventional paradigms.</p>

            <p>We investigate the charging dynamics of a frequency-modulated quantum battery (QB) placed within a dissipative cavity environment. Our study focuses on the interaction of such a battery under both weak and strong coupling regimes, employing a model in which the quantum battery and charger are represented as frequency-modulated qubits indirectly coupled through a zero-temperature environment. It is demonstrated that both the modulation frequency and amplitude are crucial for optimizing the charging process and the ergotropy of the quantum battery. Specifically, high-amplitude, low-frequency modulation significantly enhances charging performance and work extraction in the strong coupling regime. As an intriguing result, it is deduced that modulation at very low frequencies leads to the emergence of energy storage and work extraction in the weak coupling regime. Such a result can never be achieved without modulation in the weak coupling regime. These results highlight the importance of adjusting modulation parameters to optimize the performance of quantum batteries for real-world applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim A. Nicoli, Luca J. Wagner, Lena Funcke</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a powerful class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms designed to approximate the ground state of a quantum system described by its Hamiltonian. VQEs hold promise for various applications, including lattice field theory. However, the inherent noise of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses a significant challenge for running VQEs as these algorithms are particularly susceptible to noise, e.g., measurement shot noise and hardware noise. In a recent work, it was proposed to enhance the classical optimization of VQEs with Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Optimization, as these machine-learning techniques are well-suited for handling noisy data. In these proceedings, we provide additional insights into this new algorithm and present further numerical experiments. In particular, we examine the impact of hardware noise and error mitigation on the algorithm's performance. We validate the algorithm using classical simulations of quantum hardware, including hardware noise benchmarks, which have not been considered in previous works. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that GP-enhanced algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art baselines, laying the foundation for future research on deploying these techniques to real quantum hardware and lattice field theory setups.</p>

            <p>We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</p>

            <h2>Fidelity Strange Correlators for Average Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Hao Zhang, Yang Qi, Zhen Bi</p>
            <p>Topological phases in open quantum systems have become an exciting area of research, driven by the rising importance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms. The concept of Average Symmetry-Protected Topological (ASPT) phases extends symmetry-protected topological phases to quantum systems affected by disorder or decoherence. To identify nontrivial ASPT states, we introduce a "fidelity strange correlator" (FSC), which operates directly on a single bulk density matrix without boundaries. For nontrivial ASPT phases in one and two dimensions, we show that the FSC reveals long-range or power-law behavior. In several two-dimensional examples, we establish a link between the FSC and certain non-local correlation functions in statistical loop models with quantum corrections, enabling us to derive exact scaling exponents for the FSC. In addition, we discuss methods to measure the FSC using classical shadow tomography. Our work lays the groundwork for identifying these intriguing topological phases of matter in open quantum systems, both numerically and experimentally.</p>

            <p>Anisotropy endows topological aspects in optical systems and furnishes a platform to explore non-Hermitian physics, which can be harnessed for the polarization-selective amplification of light. Here, we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity via polarization-controlled optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization-dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A Parity-Time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonian has been proposed to explain the emergence of a single polarization mode, essential for achieving a zero-threshold lasing condition. Additionally, intensity correlation measurements of the Stokes modes validate the coherence properties of the emitted light. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser in anisotropic microcavity can open up a new research direction exploring non-Hermitian and topological aspects of light in anisotropic two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Energy efficiency in computation is ultimately limited by noise, with quantum limits setting the fundamental noise floor. Analog physical neural networks hold promise for improved energy efficiency compared to digital electronic neural networks. However, they are typically operated in a relatively high-power regime so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large, and the noise can be treated as a perturbation. We study optical neural networks where all layers except the last are operated in the limit that each neuron can be activated by just a single photon, and as a result the noise on neuron activations is no longer merely perturbative. We show that by using a physics-based probabilistic model of the neuron activations in training, it is possible to perform accurate machine-learning inference in spite of the extremely high shot noise (SNR ~ 1). We experimentally demonstrated MNIST handwritten-digit classification with a test accuracy of 98% using an optical neural network with a hidden layer operating in the single-photon regime; the optical energy used to perform the classification corresponds to just 0.038 photons per multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation. Our physics-aware stochastic training approach might also prove useful with non-optical ultra-low-power hardware.</p>

            <p>Motivated by general probability theory, we say that the set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is \emph{antipodal of rank $k$}, if for any $k+1$ elements $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}\in S$, there is an affine map from $\mathrm{conv}(S)$ to the $k$-dimensional simplex $\Delta_k$ that maps $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}$ bijectively onto the $k+1$ vertices of $\Delta_k$. For $k=1$, it coincides with the well-studied notion of (pairwise) antipodality introduced by Klee. We consider the following natural generalization of Klee's problem on antipodal sets: What is the maximum size of an antipodal set of rank $k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$? We present a geometric characterization of antipodal sets of rank $k$ and adapting the argument of Danzer and Grünbaum originally developed for the $k=1$ case, we prove an upper bound which is exponential in the dimension. We show that this problem can be connected to a classical question in computer science on finding perfect hashes, and it provides a lower bound on the maximum size, which is also exponential in the dimension. By connecting rank-$k$ antipodality to $k$-neighborly polytopes, we obtain another upper bound when $k>d/2$.</p>

            <p>The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</p>

            <p>We systematically study gapless edge modes corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of two-dimensional three-state Potts paramagnets on a triangular lattice. First, we derive microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite-size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding number symmetry. As a result, one-dimensional chains with this symmetry form a model that supports gapless excitations due to its tricritical symmetry. Numerically, we show that low-energy states in the continuous limit of the edge model can be described by conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$, given by the coset $SU_k(3)/SU_k(2)$ CFT at level k=1.</p>

            <p>We consider a fermionic quantum system exchanging particles with an environment at a fixed temperature and study its reduced evolution by means of a Redfield-I equation with time-dependent (non-Markovian) coefficients. We find that the description can be efficiently reduced to a standard-form Redfield-II equation, however, with a time-dependent effective bath temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective temperature appears to be very high, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a time-local master equation, offering high accuracy at all times and preserving the crucial properties of the density matrix. It includes non-Markovian relaxation processes beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods and can be further applied to various types of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equations. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</p>

On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance.

            <p>The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</p>

            <p>Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</p>

            <p>We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpiński gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpiński gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpiński gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</p>

            <h2>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friedrich Hübner, Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Description of Wave Dark Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhong Yeon Cheong, Nicholas L. Rodd, Lian-Tao Wang</p>
            <p>We outline a fundamentally quantum description of bosonic dark matter (DM) from which the conventional classical-wave picture emerges in the limit $m \ll 10~\textrm{eV}$. As appropriate for a quantum system, we start from the density matrix which encodes the full information regarding the possible measurements we could make of DM and their fluctuations. Following fundamental results in quantum optics, we argue that for DM it is most likely that the density matrix takes the explicitly mixed form of a Gaussian over the basis of coherent states. Deviations from this would generate non-Gaussian fluctuations in DM observables, allowing a direct probe of the quantum state of DM. Our quantum optics inspired approach allows us to rigorously define and interpret various quantities that are often only described heuristically, such as the coherence time or length. The formalism further provides a continuous description of DM through the wave-particle transition, which we exploit to study how density fluctuations over various physical scales evolve between the two limits and to reveal the unique behavior of DM near the boundary of the wave and particle descriptions.</p>

            <h2>Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</p>

            <h2>Towards a complete classification of holographic entropy inequalities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Bao, Keiichiro Furuya, Joydeep Naskar</p>
            <p>We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities that have corresponding contraction maps and argue the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the argued completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valla Fatemi, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck</p>
            <p>Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement asymmetry in the Hayden-Preskill protocol</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-Huang Chen, Zi-Jun Tang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</p>

            <h2>Generating Sets of Stochastic Matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik vom Ende, Fereshte Shahbeigi</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the concept of a generating set for stochastic matrices -- a subset of matrices whose repeated composition generates the entire set. Understanding such generating sets requires specifying the "indivisible elements" and "building blocks" within the set, which serve as fundamental components of the generation process. Expanding upon prior studies, we develop a framework that formalizes divisibility in the context of stochastic matrices. We provide a sufficient condition for divisibility that is shown to be necessary in dimension $n=3$, while for $n=2$, all stochastic matrices are shown to be divisible. Using these results, we construct generating sets for dimensions 2 and 3 by specifying the indivisible elements, and, importantly, we give an upper bound for the number of factors required from the generating set to produce the entire semigroup.</p>

            <h2>Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonhyun Yeo, Haena Shim</p>
            <p>An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Metric Field as Emergence of Hilbert Space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maysam Yousefian, Mehrdad Farhoudi</p>
            <p>First, we explain some ambiguities of spacetime and metric field as fundamental concepts. Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of acceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we investigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the Minkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the Minkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum. Furthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then extract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this approach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed QAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field theory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept instead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.</p>

            <h2>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics & Krylov Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyun-Sik Jeong, Arnab Kundu, Juan F. Pedraza</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</p>

            <h2>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul-Louis Etienney, Rémi Robin, Pierre Rouchon</p>
            <p>We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution. In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</p>

            <p>Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting faces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs inherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality constraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression, reducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of 1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE 0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with angle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery rate forecasting.</p>

            <h2>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</p>
