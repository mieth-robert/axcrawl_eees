            <h2>Rényi and Tsallis information entropies for the Darboux III quantum nonlinear oscillator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Baena-Jimenez, Angel Ballesteros, Ivan Gutierrez-Sagredo, Javier Relancio</p>
            <p>The Darboux III oscillator is an exactly solvable $N$-dimensional nonlinear oscillator defined on a radially symmetric space with non-constant negative curvature. Its one-dimensional version can be seen as a position dependent mass system whose mass function $\mu = (1 + \lambda x^2)$ depends on the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$, such that in the limit $\lambda \to 0$ the harmonic oscillator is recovered. In this paper, a detailed study of the entropic moments and of the Rényi and Tsallis information entropies for the quantum version of the one-dimensional Darboux III oscillator is presented. In particular, analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities in position space are obtained. Since the Fourier transform of the Darboux III wave functions does not admit a closed form expression, a numerical analysis of these quantities has been performed. Throughout the paper the interplay between the entropy parameter $\alpha$ and the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$ is analysed, and known results for the Shannon entropy of the Darboux III and for the Rényi and Tsallis entropies of the harmonic oscillator are recovered in the limits $\alpha \to 1$ and $\lambda \to 0$, respectively. Finally, motivated by the strong non-linear effects arising when large values of $\lambda$ and/or highly excited states are considered, an approximation to the probability density function valid in those regimes is presented. From it, an analytical approximation to the probability density in momentum space can be obtained, and some of the previously observed effects arising from the interplay between $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ can be explained.</p>

            <h2>Layerwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Quantum Clients using Quorus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Han, Nicholas S. DiBrita, Daniel Leeds, Jianqiang Li, Jason Ludmir, Tirthak Patel</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning (QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget, qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on average over the state-of-the-art.</p>

            <h2>A Commuting Hamiltonian Framework for Quantum Time Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas R. Allgood</p>
            <p>We develop a mathematical framework for quantum time transfer based on commuting families of Hamiltonians and synchronization observables. The synchronization subspace is defined as the kernel of a difference operator between local clocks, and we show that this subspace is preserved exactly by a commutative $*$-subalgebra of Hamiltonians compatible with the clocks. Our first main result establishes \emph{perturbative stability}: for $\epsilon$-compatible dynamics, where the commutator with the synchronization operator is bounded in norm by $\epsilon$, we prove quantitative drift bounds showing that timing correlations degrade at most linearly in time with slope proportional to $\epsilon$. Our second main result provides a \emph{representation-theoretic classification}: in the presence of a finite group symmetry, the synchronization subspace coincides with the diagonal isotypic component in the tensor product decomposition, and synchronization preservation is characterized by the commutant algebra of the group action. These results identify synchronization as a structural invariant of operator algebras, connecting approximate commutation, kernel-preserving dynamics, and symmetry protection. Beyond quantum time transfer, the framework suggests categorical and resource-theoretic generalizations and contributes to the broader study of operator-algebraic invariants in multipartite quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Toward Uncertainty-Aware and Generalizable Neural Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Mi, Frank Mueller</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet decoding errors via conventional algorithms result in limited accuracy (i.e., suppression of logical errors) and high overheads, both of which can be alleviated by inference-based decoders. To date, such machine-learning (ML) decoders lack two key properties crucial for practical fault tolerance: reliable uncertainty quantification and robust generalization to previously unseen codes. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{QuBA}, a Bayesian graph neural decoder that integrates attention to both dot-product and multi-head, enabling expressive error-pattern recognition alongside calibrated uncertainty estimates. Building on QuBA, we further develop \textbf{SAGU }\textbf{(Sequential Aggregate Generalization under Uncertainty)}, a multi-code training framework with enhanced cross-domain robustness enabling decoding beyond the training set. Experiments on bivariate bicycle (BB) codes and their coprime variants demonstrate that (i) both QuBA and SAGU consistently outperform the classical baseline belief propagation (BP), achieving a reduction of on average \emph{one order of magnitude} in logical error rate (LER), and up to \emph{two orders of magnitude} under confident-decision bounds on the coprime BB code $[[154, 6, 16]]$; (ii) QuBA also surpasses state-of-the-art neural decoders, providing an advantage of roughly \emph{one order of magnitude} (e.g., for the larger BB code $[[756, 16, \leq34]]$) even when considering conservative (safe) decision bounds; (iii) SAGU achieves decoding performance comparable to or even outperforming QuBA's domain-specific training approach.</p>

            <h2>Asymptotic Vanishing of the Success Probability in Shor's Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João P. da Cruz</p>
            <p>Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -> infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</p>

            <h2>Extended validations on photon number resolving detector based Gaussian boson sampling with low noises</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Ji, Yongzheng Wu, Shi Wang, Jie Hou, Zijian Wang, Bo Jiang</p>
            <p>Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a variety of boson sampling overcoming the stable single-photon preparation difficulty of the later. However, like those in the original version, noises in GBS will also result in the deviation of output patterns and the reduction of classical simulation complexity. We extend the pattern recognition validation, together with the correlation approach as a comparison, on GBS using photon number resolving detectors with noises of both photon loss and distinguishability, to quantificationally evaluate noise levels. As for the classical simulation with noises to be used during validations, it is actually a simulation of mixed states where we employ an existing photon-pair strategy to realize polynomial speedup locally. Furthermore, we use an output-binning strategy to realize validation speedup. Our simulation indicates that the pattern recognition protocol is robust on noise evaluations of GBS even when noises are sufficiently low.</p>

            <h2>Quantum matrix arithmetics with Hamiltonian evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Kang, Yuan Su</p>
            <p>The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</p>

            <h2>High-dimensional detection-loophole-free measurement-device-independent quantum random number generator</h2>

            <p>Certifying random number generators is challenging, especially in security-critical fields like cryptography. Here, we demonstrate a measurement-device-independent quantum random number generator (MDI-QRNG) using high-dimensional photonic path states. Our setup extends the standard qubit beam-splitter QRNG to a three-output version with tunable fiber-optic interferometers acting as tunable beam splitters and superconducting detectors. This setup generates over 1.2 bits per round and 1.77 Mbits per second of certifiably secure private randomness without requiring \emph{any} trust in the measurement apparatus, a critical requirement for the security of real-world cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate certifiably secure high-dimensional quantum random-number generation, paving the way for practical, scalable QRNGs without the need for complex devices.</p>

            <h2>An efficient algorithm to compute entanglement in states with low magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ChunJun Cao, Gong Cheng, Tianci Zhou</p>
            <p>A bottleneck for analyzing the interplay between magic and entanglement is the computation of these quantities in highly entangled quantum many-body magic states. Efficient extraction of entanglement can also inform our understanding of dynamical quantum processes such as measurement-induced phase transition and approximate unitary designs. We develop an efficient classical algorithm to compute the von Neumann entropy and entanglement spectrum for such states under the condition that they have low stabilizer nullity. The algorithm exploits the property of stabilizer codes to separate entanglement into two pieces: one generated by the common stabilizer group and the other from the logical state. The low-nullity constraint ensures both pieces can be computed efficiently. Our algorithm can be applied to study the entanglement in sparsely $T$-doped circuits with possible Pauli measurements as well as certain classes of states that have both high entanglement and magic. Combining with stabilizer learning subroutines, it also enables the efficient learning of von Neumann entropies for low-nullity states prepared on quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum advantage from random geometrically-two-local Hamiltonian dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihui Quek</p>
            <p>Classical hardness-of-sampling results are largely established for random quantum circuits, whereas analog simulators natively realize time evolutions under geometrically local Hamiltonians. Does a typical such Hamiltonian already yield classically-intractable dynamics? We answer this question in the affirmative for the ensemble of geometrically-2-local Hamiltonians with Gaussian coefficients, evolved for constant time. This naturally leads to a quantum advantage scheme with clear prospects for experimental realization, necessitating only course-grained control. We give strong evidence of hardness for this physically-relevant ensemble. We develop the first worst-to-average-case reduction for approximating output probabilities of (time-independent) geometrically-2-local Hamiltonian evolutions. Our reduction proceeds by nonstandard means: while we also leverage polynomial interpolation, unlike previous works, we reduce directly to an evaluator for the exact distribution over Hamiltonians, from which we are trying to prove that sampling is hard. Previous works instead sampled from various perturbations of the true distribution, introducing additional constraints meant to keep the perturbation, measured in total variation distance, under control. We dispense with this step. Our reduction consists in a robust multivariate polynomial interpolation, reduced to sequential robust univariate interpolations via the symmetries of the Gaussian. We circumvent the fact that random Hamiltonians lack a hiding symmetry, a key property in previous proofs. We also contribute an algorithmic version of Berlekamp-Welch to deal with errored evaluations, solving an open problem from the RCS literature. We expect the machinery we develop to find use in average-case Hamiltonian complexity, filling in a gap in this literature which has thus far focussed on worst-case hardness results.</p>

            <h2>Blind quantum computing with different qudit resource state architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alena Romanova, Wolfgang Dür</p>
            <p>We discuss how blind quantum computing generalizes to multi-level quantum systems (qudits), which offers advantages compared to the qubit approach. Here, a quantum computing task is delegated to an untrusted server while simultaneously preventing the server from retrieving information about the computation it performs, the input, and the output, enabling secure cloud-based quantum computing. In the standard approach with qubits, measurement-based quantum computing is used: single-qubit measurements on cluster or brickwork states implement the computation, while random rotations of the resource qubits hide the computation from the server. We generalize finite-sized approximately universal gate sets to prime-power-dimensional qudits and show that qudit versions of the cluster and brickwork states enable a similar server-blind execution of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we compare the overheads of different resource state architectures and discuss which hiding strategies apply to alternative qudit resource states beyond graph states.</p>

            <h2>Classically Sampling Noisy Quantum Circuits in Quasi-Polynomial Time under Approximate Markovianity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan F. Zhang, Su-un Lee, Liang Jiang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in $n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits: (1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate. These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naomi R. Solomons, Damian Markham</p>
            <p>Networks of sensors are a promising scheme to deliver the benefits of quantum technologies in coming years, offering enhanced precision and accuracy for distributed metrology through the use of large entangled states. Recent work has additionally explored the privacy of these schemes, meaning that local parameters can be kept secret while a joint function of these is estimated by the network. In this work, we use the abstract cryptography framework to relate the two proposed definitions of quasi-privacy, showing that both are composable, which enables the protocol to be securely included as a sub-routine to other schemes. We give an explicit example that estimating the mean of a set of parameters using GHZ states is composably fully secure.</p>

            <h2>Classical simulation of noisy random circuits from exponential decay of correlation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Su-un Lee, Soumik Ghosh, Changhun Oh, Kyungjoo Noh, Bill Fefferman, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>We study the classical simulability of noisy random quantum circuits under general noise models. While various classical algorithms for simulating noisy random circuits have been proposed, many of them rely on the anticoncentration property, which can fail when the circuit depth is small or under realistic noise models. We propose a new approach based on the exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), a measure of tripartite correlations. We prove that exponential CMI decay enables a classical algorithm to sample from noisy random circuits -- in polynomial time for one dimension and quasi-polynomial time for higher dimensions -- even when anticoncentration breaks down. To this end, we show that exponential CMI decay makes the circuit depth effectively shallow, and it enables efficient classical simulation for sampling. We further provide extensive numerical evidence that exponential CMI decay is a universal feature of noisy random circuits across a wide range of noise models. Our results establish CMI decay, rather than anticoncentration, as the fundamental criterion for classical simulability, and delineate the boundary of quantum advantage in noisy devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Iadecola</p>
            <p>In quantum many-body systems with kinetically constrained dynamics, the Hilbert space can split into exponentially many disconnected subsectors, a phenomenon known as Hilbert-space fragmentation. We study the interplay of such fragmentation with symmetries, focusing on charge conserving systems with charge conjugation and translation symmetries as a concrete example. The non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented subsectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which can be highly entangled. This algebra also provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures of Hilbert-space fragmentation, such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.</p>

            <h2>Recent quantum runtime (dis)advantages</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Tuziemski, J. Pawłowski, P. Tarasiuk, Ł. Pawela, B. Gardas</p>
            <p>We (re)evaluate recent claims of quantum advantage in annealing- and gate-based algorithms, testing whether reported speedups survive rigorous end-to-end runtime definitions and comparison against strong classicalbaselines. Conventional analyses often omit substantial overhead (readout, transpilation, thermalization, etc.) yielding biased assessments. While excluding seemingly not important parts of the simulation may seem reasonable, on most current quantum hardware a clean separation between "pure compute" and "overhead" cannot be experimentally justified. This may distort "supremacy" results. In contrast, for most classical hardware total time $\approx$ compute $+$ a weakly varying constant leading to robust claims. We scrutinize two important milestones: (1) quantum annealing for approximate QUBO [this https URL], which uses a sensible time-to-$\epsilon$ metric but proxies runtime by the annealing time (non-measurable); (2) a restricted Simon's problem [this https URL] , whose advantageous scaling in oracle calls is undisputed; yet, as we demonstrate, estimated runtime of the quantum experiment is $\sim 100 \times$ slower than a tuned classical baseline. Finally, we show that recently claimed "runtime advantage" of the BF-DCQO hybrid algorithm (arXiv:2505.08663) does not withstand rigorous benchmarking. Therefore, we conclude that runtime-based supremacy remains elusive on NISQ hardware, and credible claims require a careful time accounting with a proper reference selections, and an adequate metric.</p>

            <h2>Generalised quantum Sanov theorem revisited</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>Given two families of quantum states $A$ and $B$, called the null and the alternative hypotheses, quantum hypothesis testing is the task of determining whether an unknown quantum state belongs to $A$ or $B$. Mistaking $A$ for $B$ is a type I error, and vice versa for the type II error. In quantum Shannon theory, a fundamental role is played by the Stein exponent, i.e. the asymptotic rate of decay of the type II error probability for a given threshold on the type I error probability. Stein exponents have been thoroughly investigated -- and, sometimes, calculated. However, most currently available solutions apply to settings where the hypotheses simple (i.e. composed of a single state), or else the families $A$ and $B$ need to satisfy stringent constraints that exclude physically important sets of states, such as separable states or stabiliser states. In this work, we establish a general formula for the Stein exponent where both hypotheses are allowed to be composite: the alternative hypothesis $B$ is assumed to be either composite i.i.d. or arbitrarily varying, with components taken from a known base set, while the null hypothesis $A$ is fully general, and required to satisfy only weak compatibility assumptions that are met in most physically relevant cases -- for instance, by the sets of separable or stabiliser states. Our result extends and subsumes the findings of [BBH, CMP 385:55, 2021] (that we also simplify), as well as the 'generalised quantum Sanov theorem' of [LBR, arXiv:2408.07067]. The proof relies on a careful quantum-to-classical reduction via measurements, followed by an application of the results on classical Stein exponents obtained in [Lami, arXiv:today]. We also devise new purely quantum techniques to analyse the resulting asymptotic expressions.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of Noisy Geometrically Local Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Nelson, Joel Rajakumar, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>It has been known for almost 30 years that quantum circuits with interspersed depolarizing noise converge to the uniform distribution at $\omega(\log n)$ depth, where $n$ is the number of qubits, making them classically simulable. We show that under the realistic constraint of geometric locality, this bound is loose: these circuits become classically simulable at even shallower depths. Unlike prior work in this regime, we consider sampling from worst-case circuits and noise of any constant strength. First, we prove that the output distribution of any noisy geometrically local quantum circuit can be approximately sampled from in quasipolynomial time, when its depth exceeds a fixed $\Theta(\log n)$ critical threshold which depends on the noise strength. This scaling in $n$ was previously only obtained for noisy random quantum circuits (Aharonov et. al, STOC 2023). We further conjecture that our bound is still loose and that a $\Theta(1)$-depth threshold suffices for simulability due to a percolation effect. To support this, we provide analytical evidence together with a candidate efficient algorithm. Our results rely on new information-theoretic properties of the output states of noisy shallow quantum circuits, which may be of broad interest. On a fundamental level, we demonstrate that unitary quantum processes in constant dimensions are more fragile to noise than previously understood.</p>

Here, we establish optimal bounds and protocols for estimating a linear combination of local parameters of Hamiltonians with arbitrary, unknown interactions. In the process, we more generally establish bounds for learning any linear combination of Hamiltonian coefficients for arbitrary, commuting terms. Our results unify and extend existing bounds for non-interacting qubits and multimode interferometers, providing a general framework for distributed sensing and Hamiltonian learning in realistic many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Borhan Ahmadi, Aravinth Balaji Ravichandran, Paweł Mazurek, Shabir Barzanjeh, Paweł Horodecki</p>
            <p>Quantum hardware increasingly relies on energy reserves that can later be converted into useful work; yet, most battery-like proposals demand coherent drives or engineered non-equilibrium resources, limiting practicality in noisy settings. We develop an autonomous charging paradigm in which an ensemble of identical two-level units, collectively coupled to a thermal environment, acquires work capacity without any external control. The common bath mediates interference between emission and absorption pathways, steering the many-body state away from passivity and into a steady regime with nonzero extractable work. The full charging dynamics and closed-form expressions are obtained for the steady-state, showing favorable scaling with the number of cells that approach the many-body optimum. We show that the mechanism is robust to local noise: under a convex mixture of collective and local dissipation, non-zero steady-state ergotropy persists, exhibits counterintuitive finite-temperature optima, and remains operative when the collective channel is comparable to or stronger than the local one. We show that environmental fluctuations can be harnessed to realize drive-free, scalable quantum batteries compatible with circuit- and cavity-QED platforms. Used as local work buffers, such batteries could potentially enable rapid ancilla reset, bias dissipative stabilizer pumps, and reduce syndrome-extraction overhead in fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Fourier Spectrum of Noisy Quantum Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uma Girish</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise. Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$ algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$, $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Zanardi, Emanuel Dallas, Faidon Andreadakis</p>
            <p>We introduce the novel concept of mereological quantum phase transition (m-QPTs). Our framework is based on a variational family of operator algebras defining generalized tensor product structures (g-TPS), a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian, and a quantum scrambling functional. By minimizing the scrambling functional, one selects a g-TPS, enabling a pullback of the natural information-geometric metric on the g-TPS manifold to the parameter space. The singularities of this induced metric -- so-called algebra susceptibility -- in the thermodynamic limit characterize the m-QPTs. We illustrate this framework through analytical examples involving quantum coherence and operator entanglement. Moreover, spin-chains numerical simulations show susceptibility sharp responses at an integrability point and strong growth across disorder-induced localization, suggesting critical reorganizations of emergent subsystem structure aligned with those transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Karlsson Öhman, Daqing Wang, R. Matthias Geilhufe, Christian Schäfer</p>
            <p>Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Optimal filtering and generation of entangled photons for quantum applications in the presence of noise</h2>

            <p>Filtering is commonly used in quantum optics to reject noise photons, and also to enable interference between independent photons. However, filtering the joint spectrum of photon pairs can reduce the inherent coincidence probability or loss-independent heralding efficiency. Here, we investigate filtering for multiphoton applications based on entanglement and interference (e.g., quantum teleportation). We multiplex C-band entangled photons and C-band classical communications into the same long-distance fibers, which enables scalable low-loss quantum networking but requires filtering of spontaneous Raman scattering noise from classical light. Using tunable-bandwidth filters, low-jitter detectors, and polarization filters, we co-propagate time-bin-entangled photons at wavelengths compatible with erbium-ion quantum memories (1536.5 nm) and 10-Gbps C-band classical data over 25 km/25 km of standard fiber. Narrow filtering enables mW-level C-band power, which exceeds comparable studies by roughly an order of magnitude and could feasibly support Tbps classical rates. We evaluate how performance depends on pump and filter bandwidths, multipair emission, filter shapes, loss, phase matching, and how quantum information is measured. We find a trade-off between improving noise impact and single-mode purity and discuss mitigation methods toward optimal multiphoton applications. Importantly, these results apply to noise in free space and in quantum devices (sources, frequency converters, switches, detectors, etc.) and provide insight on filter-induced degradation of single-photon purity and rates even in noise-free environments.</p>

            <h2>Adapting Quantum Machine Learning for Energy Dissociation of Bonds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swathi Chandrasekhar, Shiva Raj Pokhrel, Navneet Singh</p>
            <p>Accurate prediction of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) underpins mechanistic insight and the rational design of molecules and materials. We present a systematic, reproducible benchmark comparing quantum and classical machine learning models for BDE prediction using a chemically curated feature set encompassing atomic properties (atomic numbers, hybridization), bond characteristics (bond order, type), and local environmental descriptors. Our quantum framework, implemented in Qiskit Aer on six qubits, employs ZZFeatureMap encodings with variational ansatz (RealAmplitudes) across multiple architectures Variational Quantum Regressors (VQR), Quantum Support Vector Regressors (QSVR), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), and Quantum Random Forests (QRF). These are rigorously benchmarked against strong classical baselines, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Comprehensive evaluation spanning absolute and relative error metrics, threshold accuracies, and error distributions shows that top-performing quantum models (QCNN, QRF) match the predictive accuracy and robustness of classical ensembles and deep networks, particularly within the chemically prevalent mid-range BDE regime. These findings establish a transparent baseline for quantum-enhanced molecular property prediction and outline a practical foundation for advancing quantum computational chemistry toward near chemical accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic Insulator and Possible Superfluid Based on Two-Dimensional Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shisheng Lin, Shaoqi Huang, Minhui Yang, Xin Chen, Hongjia Bi, Kangchen Xiong</p>
            <p>Recent research on excitonic insulator has progressed mainly based on narrow bandgap semiconductor or semimetal. Herein, we realize excitonic insulator based on two-dimensional (2D) wide band gap diamond with transition temperature as high as 220K. The resistance rises dramatically by more than three orders, which can be explained by the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons. While cooling down below transition temperature, the wavelength of the bound excitons caused by boron and nitrogen centers becomes highly overlapped, leading to BEC process. Furthermore, the variable range hopping mechanism is used to simulate the resistance as a function of temperature, which reveals the formation of excitonic insulator. When temperature drops down further, a sudden drop of resistance over three orders was observed around 60K, possibly due to the formation of non-equilibrium excitonic superfluid resulting from highly overlap of wavelength of the large density bound excitons at lower temperature. This study provides evidences for excitonic insulator and possible superfluid phase based on wide bandgap semiconductor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fynn Otto, Refik Mansuroglu, Norbert Schuch, Otfried Gühne, Hanno Sahlmann</p>
            <p>We study the existence and limitations for hyperinvariant tensor networks incorporating a local SU(2) symmetry. As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Geometry Codes and Decoded Quantum Interferometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andi Gu, Stephen P. Jordan</p>
            <p>Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) defines a duality that pairs decoding problems with optimization problems. The original work on DQI considered Reed-Solomon decoding, whose dual optimization problem, called Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a finite field. Here, we consider a class of algebraic geometry codes called Hermitian codes, which achieve block length $q^3$ using alphabet $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ compared to Reed-Solomon's limitation to block length $q$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, requiring approximately one-third fewer qubits per field element for quantum implementations. We show that the dual optimization problem, which we call Hermitian Optimal Polynomial Intersection (HOPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a Hermitian curve, and because the dual to a Hermitian code is another Hermitian code, the HOPI problem can also be viewed as approximate list recovery for Hermitian codes. By comparing to Prange's algorithm, simulated annealing, and algebraic list recovery algorithms, we find a large parameter regime in which DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation than these classical algorithms, suggesting that the apparent quantum speedup offered by DQI extends beyond Reed-Solomon codes to a broader class of polynomial regression problems on algebraic varieties.</p>

            <p>We apply the combined technique of postselected amplification and photon-recycling to an optical setup of magnetic field precision measurement. We propose two recycling schemes and carry out analytic expressions for the amplified signal and measurement sensitivity. The results show significant improvement of performance over conventional measurement. The underlying reason is twofold. On one aspect, introducing the technique of recycling eliminates the shortcoming of data discarding in postselection, thus maintains similar noise level of conventional measurement (without postselection). On the other aspect, performing intentional postselection within the recycling framework, which was originally proposed in the context of gravitational wave detection, can amplify the signal. Thus, the measurement signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shouzhen Gu, Libor Caha, Shin Ho Choe, Zhiyang He, Aleksander Kubica, Eugene Tang</p>
            <p>We investigate layer codes, a family of three-dimensional stabilizer codes that can achieve optimal scaling of code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier, as candidates for self-correcting quantum memories. First, we introduce two decoding algorithms for layer codes with provable guarantees for local stochastic and adversarial noise, respectively. We then prove that layer codes constitute partially self-correcting quantum memories which outperform previously analyzed models such as the cubic code and the welded solid code. Notably, we argue that partial self-correction without the requirement of efficient decoding is more common than expected, as it arises solely from a diverging energy barrier. This draws a sharp distinction between partially self-correcting systems and partially self-correcting memories. Another novel aspect of our work is an analysis of layer codes constructed from random Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes. We show that these random layer codes have optimal scaling (up to logarithmic corrections) of code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier. Finally, we present numerical studies of their memory times and report behavior consistent with partial self-correction.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the importance of symmetries in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms to prepare the ground or specific low-lying states of quantum Hamiltonians. We examine two spin problems, one with random all-to-all couplings inspired by neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae, and the standard Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian on a $4 \times 3$ lattice. The neutrino Hamiltonian has the total spin $J$ and third component $J_{\rm{z}}$ as its only symmetries. The Heisenberg model has these symmetries plus translational invariance and reflection symmetry. We demonstrate that the convergence of variational methods is dramatically improved by keeping all symmetries. In both cases a nearly exact solution can be obtained in cases where standard unconstrained variational algorithms fail. Since variational algorithms can use standard Trotter steps as part of the optimization, allowing additional correlations that obey all the symmetries of the Hamiltonian will speed convergence of variational algorithms. This will lead to faster convergence than standard projection algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Continuous measurement-based holonomic quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anirudh Lanka, Juan Garcia-Nila, Todd A. Brun</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to generate holonomies using the Quantum Zeno effect, enabling logical unitary operations on quantum stabilizer codes purely through measurements. The quantum error-correcting code space is adiabatically rotated by measuring a succession of rotated stabilizer generators. When the rotation is sufficiently slow, the state remains confined to the instantaneous code space by the Zeno effect; otherwise, measurement-induced jumps can occur into a rotated orthogonal subspace. If the rotation completes a closed loop, the code state is transformed by a holonomy: a logical unitary transformation. We analytically derive the sequence of rotated stabilizer generators that produce a desired holonomy, and find the total time required to implement this procedure with a given success probability. If a measurement moves the state to the orthogonal subspace, we present a method to alter the path of the rotated observables to return the state either to the original code or the original error space with the desired holonomy; in the latter case, the holonomy is emulated. Finally, we establish conditions on the code and the measured observables that preserve the correctability of a given error set. When a code fails to meet the error-correcting conditions, our protocol remains applicable by augmenting the code with at most two ancilla qubits.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Global Entanglement-Distillation Policies in Quantum Repeater Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iftach Yakar, Michael Ben-Or</p>
            <p>Quantum repeaters are essential for achieving long-distance quantum communication due to photon loss, which grows exponentially with the channel distance. Current quantum repeater generations use entanglement distillation protocols, where the decision of when to perform distillation depends on either local or global knowledge. Recent approaches for quantum repeaters, such as Mantri et al. (arXiv:2409.06152), consider using deterministic local decision policies for entanglement distillation. We ask whether global deterministic policies outperform local ones in terms of communication rate. We simulate equidistant repeater chains, assisted by two-way classical communication, and compare local and global policies for distillation decisions, spanning large distances and varying network and hardware parameters. Our findings show that global deterministic policies consistently outperform these local ones, and in some cases, determine whether secret communication is possible. For large repeater chains ($N>512$), global policies improve SKR by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that local distillation decisions in quantum repeater chains may not be optimal, and may inform future protocol design.</p>

            <h2>Fast-forwardable Lindbladians imply quantum phase estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong-Xia Shang, Naixu Guo, Patrick Rebentrost, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Tongyang Li, Qi Zhao</p>
            <p>Quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Lindbladian dynamics are both foundational in quantum information science and central to quantum algorithm design. In this work, we bridge these two concepts: certain simple Lindbladian processes can be adapted to perform QPE-type tasks. However, unlike QPE, which achieves Heisenberg-limit scaling, these Lindbladian evolutions are restricted to standard quantum limit complexity. This indicates that, different from Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$ within an error $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost, whose mechanism is fundamentally different from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of dissipative dynamics. We also adopt our fast-forwarding algorithm for efficient Gibbs state preparation and demonstrate the counter-intuitive implication: the allowance of a quadratically accelerated decoherence effect under arbitrary Pauli noise.</p>

            <h2>Constant-Overhead Addressable Gates via Single-Shot Code Switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Golowich, Kathleen Chang, Guanyu Zhu</p>
            <p>It is a major challenge to perform addressable and parallel logical operations on constant-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes. Indeed, the overhead of targeting specific logical qubits represents a crucial bottleneck in many quantum fault-tolerance schemes. We introduce fault-tolerant protocols for performing various addressable as well as parallel logical operations with constant space-time overhead, on a family of constant-rate and polynomial-distance qLDPC codes. Specifically, we construct gadgets for a large class of permutations of logical qubits. We apply these logical permutations to construct gadgets for applying a targeted Hadamard (or $CNOT$) gate on any chosen logical qubit (pair). We also construct gadgets for preparing logical code states, and for applying Hadamard gates on all logical qubits in a codeblock. All of our gadgets use constant quantum space-time overhead along with polynomially bounded classical computation. Prior protocols for such operations required larger overhead, or else relied on codes with certain symmetries that lack known asymptotic constructions. Our codes are given by tensor products of classical codes constructed from lossless expander graphs. Our core technical contribution is a constant-overhead code-switching procedure between 2- and 3-dimensional product codes, which generalizes Bombin's dimensional jump (arXiv:1412.5079). We prove that all of our gadgets exhibit a constant threshold under locally stochastic noise. Along the way, we develop a small-set flip decoder for high-dimensional product codes from lossless expanders. Our techniques yield additional interesting consequences, such as single-shot state preparation of 2-dimensional product codes with constant space-time overhead. We also propose a method for performing parallel non-Clifford gates by extending our techniques to codes supporting transversal application of such gates.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Guarantees of Variational Quantum Algorithm with Guiding States</h2>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are prominent candidates for near-term quantum advantage but lack rigorous guarantees of convergence and generalization. By contrast, quantum phase estimation (QPE) provides provable performance under the guiding state assumption, where access to a state with non-trivial overlap with the ground state enables efficient energy estimation. In this work, we ask whether similar guarantees can be obtained for VQAs. We introduce a variational quantum algorithm with guiding states aiming towards predicting ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. We then develop a proof technique-the linearization trick-that maps the training dynamics of the algorithm to those of a kernel model. This connection yields the first theoretical guarantees on both convergence and generalization for the VQA under the guiding state assumption. Our analysis shows that guiding states accelerate convergence, suppress finite-size error terms, and ensure stability across system dimensions. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on 2D random Heisenberg models.</p>

            <p>Classical simulation of quantum circuits is a critical tool for validating quantum hardware and probing the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Existing state-of-the-art methods, notably tensor network approaches, have computational costs governed by the treewidth of the underlying circuit graph, making circuits with large treewidth intractable. This work rigorously analyzes FeynmanDD, a decision diagram-based simulation method proposed in CAV 2025 by a subset of the authors, and shows that the size of the multi-terminal decision diagram used in FeynmanDD is exponential in the linear rank-width of the circuit graph. As linear rank-width can be substantially smaller than treewidth and is at most larger than the treewidth by a logarithmic factor, our analysis demonstrates that FeynmanDD outperforms all tensor network-based methods for certain circuit families. We also show that the method remains efficient if we use the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm to expand arbitrary single-qubit gates to sequences of Hadamard and T gates, essentially removing the gate-set restriction posed by the method.</p>

            <p>Understanding the entanglement structure of local Hamiltonian ground spaces is a physically motivated problem, with applications ranging from tensor network design to quantum error-correcting codes. To this end, we study the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Golowich, Venkatesan Guruswami</p>
            <p>It is a major challenge to construct good quantum codes supporting fault-tolerant (e.g. transversal) non-Clifford gates with low-weight parity-check measurements. In this paper, we construct the first known quantum codes with linear dimension and distance supporting transversal non-Clifford gates that have sublinear locality (i.e. parity-check weight). Specifically, we construct codes with transversal $CCZ$ gates that have dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ denotes the block length. We furthermore design an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes. The alphabet size of these codes is $q=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$, but it can be reduced to a constant (e.g. $q=2$) while incurring a polylogarithmic loss in other parameters. We also show how to decrease the locality to $O(N^{1/3})$, albeit with a larger alphabet size and slightly lower distance. We construct these codes as products of classical codes with appropriate algebraic structure. While our quantum codes are subsystem codes with non-commuting gauge operators, we show they nevertheless permit error correction from noisy syndrome measurements. As byproducts, we prove multiple technical results of independent interest. In particular, our efficient decoder can be viewed as a new multivariate generalization of Prony's method for reconstructing a function from partial access to its Fourier transform. Meanwhile, our distance analysis involves new connections to the classical study of maximally recoverable codes. Our results on product codes also resolve a conjecture of Bravyi & Hastings (2014) in the large-alphabet regime, by providing a new construction of quantum codes with dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $N^\epsilon$ for arbitrary $\epsilon>0$.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic pathway for solving differential equations within the quantum linear systems framework by combining block encoding with Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The approach is demonstrated on a complex tridiagonal linear system and extended to problems in computational fluid dynamics: the heat equation with mixed boundary conditions and the nonlinear Burgers' equation. Our scaling analysis of the heat equation shows how discretization influences the minimum singular value and the polynomial degree required for QSVT, identifying circuit-depth overhead as a key bottleneck. For Burgers' equation, we illustrate how Carleman-linearized nonlinear dynamics can be efficiently block encoded and solved within the QSVT framework. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of current methods, underscoring the need for efficient estimation of minimum singular value, depth-reduction techniques, and benchmarks against classical reachability. This pathway lays a foundation for advancing quantum linear system methods toward large-scale applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Allcock, Joao F. Doriguello, Gábor Ivanyos, Miklos Santha</p>
            <p>Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d > 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$: 1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples; 2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples; 3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples; 4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states; 5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.</p>

Standard implementations of QSVT rely on block encodings of the Hamiltonian, which are costly to construct, requiring a logarithmic number of ancilla qubits, intricate multi-qubit control, and circuit depth scaling linearly with the number of Hamiltonian terms. In contrast, our algorithms use only a single ancilla qubit and entirely avoid block encodings. We develop two methods: (i) a direct randomization of QSVT, where block encodings are replaced by importance sampling, and (ii) an approach that integrates qDRIFT into the generalized quantum signal processing framework, with the dependence on precision exponentially improved through classical extrapolation. Both algorithms achieve gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, a hallmark of randomized methods, while incurring only quadratic dependence on the degree of the target polynomial. We identify natural parameter regimes where our methods outperform even standard QSVT, making them promising for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We also establish a fundamental lower bound showing that the quadratic dependence on the polynomial degree is optimal within this framework. We apply our framework to two fundamental tasks: solving quantum linear systems and estimating ground-state properties of Hamiltonians, obtaining polynomial advantages over prior randomized algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our ground-state property estimation algorithm on electronic structure Hamiltonians and the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. In both cases, our approach outperforms prior work by several orders of magnitude in circuit depth, establishing randomized QSVT as a practical and resource-efficient alternative for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Mirrored Entanglement Witnesses for Multipartite and High-Dimensional Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiheon Seong, Anindita Bera, Beatrix C. Hiesmayr, Dariusz Chruscinski, Joonwoo Bae</p>
            <p>Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a versatile tool to detect entangled states and characterize related properties of entanglement in quantum information theory. A witness $W$ corresponds to an observable satisfying $\mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0$ for all separable states $\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}$; entangled states are detected once the inequality is violated. Recently, mirrored EWs have been introduced by showing that there exist non-trivial upper bounds to EWs, \begin{eqnarray} u_W\geq \mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0. \nonumber \end{eqnarray} An upper bound to a witness $W$ signifies the existence of the other one $M$, called a mirrored EW, such that $W+M = u_W I \otimes I$. The framework of mirrored EWs shows that a single EW can be even more useful, as it can detect a larger set of entangled states by lower and upper bounds. In this work, we develop and investigate mirrored EWs for multipartite qubit states and also for high-dimensional systems, to find the efficiency and effectiveness of mirrored EWs in detecting entangled states. We provide mirrored EWs for $n$-partite GHZ states, graph states such as two-colorable states, and tripartite bound entangled states. We also show that optimal EWs can be reflected with each other. For bipartite systems, we present mirrored EWs for existing optimal EWs and also construct a mirrored pair of optimal EWs in dimension three. Finally, we generalize mirrored EWs such that a pair of EWs can be connected by another EW, i.e., $W+M =K$ is also an EW. Our results enhance the capability of EWs to detect a larger set of entangled states in multipartite and high-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>On the emergence of quantum Darwinism and pointer states for non-commuting evolutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana A. Chisholm, G. Massimo Palma, Luca Innocenti</p>
            <p>Quantum systems achieve objectivity by redundantly encoding information about themselves into the surrounding environment, through a mechanism known as quantum Darwinism. When this happens, observes measure the environment and infer the system to be in one of its pointer states. We study the emergence of objectivity whenever the Hamiltonian of the system and the interaction Hamiltonian between system and environment do not commute, a condition which is thought to be incompatible with the presence of pointer states. We show that, not only non-commuting evolutions allow for the emergence of objective states, but it is possible to give a more relaxed definition of pointer states, that is always well defined whenever there is redundancy of information, and coincides with the usual one for commuting evolutions.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing that incorporates strong single-photon nonlinearities into a photonic GHZ-measurement-based architecture. The nonlinearities substantially reduce resource overheads compared to conventional linear-optics-based architectures, which require significant redundancy to accommodate probabilistic photon generation and probabilistic entangling operations. By removing linear-optical failure modes, our nonlinear architecture can also tolerate much higher optical losses than linear approaches, with a baseline loss tolerance of $\sim$12\% using a 32-photon resource state and a foliated surface code. Our results show how introducing a nonlinear primitive enables dramatic improvements in practical implementations of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing LOCC Protocols on Product Stiefel Manifold</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Tong Li, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Local operations and classical communication (LOCC) is a foundational framework in quantum information from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. However, designing and optimizing LOCC protocols is intractable due to their complex structure. Determining achievable bounds and designing practically implementable LOCC protocols remain crucial challenges when the number of communication rounds is finite. In this work, we develop a framework to optimize fixed-round LOCC via Riemannian optimization on the product Stiefel manifold, which not only yields near-optimal objective function values but also produces fully implementable protocols. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework through key tasks in quantum information processing, such as entanglement distillation and state merging. Our results provide new insights into the achievable bounds for entanglement distillation and block entanglement state merging. We obtain improved distillation and state merging protocols, some of which match the upper bounds derived via positive partial transpose relaxations. These results demonstrate that optimizing LOCC via manifold optimization can serve as a powerful tool to advance research on distributed quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>The Knowledge Complexity of Quantum Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulio Malavolta</p>
            <p>Foundational results in theoretical computer science have established that everything provable, is provable in zero knowledge. However, this assertion fundamentally assumes a classical interpretation of computation and many interesting physical statements that one can hope to prove are not characterized. In this work, we consider decision problems, where the problem instance itself is specified by a (pure) quantum state. We discuss several motivating examples for this notion and, as our main technical result, we show that every quantum problem that is provable with an interactive protocol, is also provable in zero-knowledge. Our protocol achieves unconditional soundness and computational zero-knowledge, under standard assumptions in cryptography. In addition, we show how our techniques yield a protocol for the Uhlmann transformation problem that achieves a meaningful notion of zero-knowledge, also in the presence of a malicious verifier.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Sparse Recovery and Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armando Bellante, Stefano Vanerio, Stefano Zanero</p>
            <p>We study quantum sparse recovery in non-orthogonal, overcomplete dictionaries: given coherent quantum access to a state and a dictionary of vectors, the goal is to reconstruct the state up to $\ell_2$ error using as few vectors as possible. We first show that the general recovery problem is NP-hard, ruling out efficient exact algorithms in full generality. To overcome this, we introduce Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QOMP), the first quantum analogue of the classical OMP greedy algorithm. QOMP combines quantum subroutines for inner product estimation, maximum finding, and block-encoded projections with an error-resetting design that avoids iteration-to-iteration error accumulation. Under standard mutual incoherence and well-conditioned sparsity assumptions, QOMP provably recovers the exact support of a $K$-sparse state in polynomial time. As an application, we give the first framework for sparse quantum tomography with non-orthogonal dictionaries in $\ell_2$ norm, achieving query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N}/\epsilon)$ in favorable regimes and reducing tomography to estimating only $K$ coefficients instead of $N$ amplitudes. In particular, for pure-state tomography with $m=O(N)$ dictionary vectors and sparsity $K=\widetilde{O}(1)$ on a well-conditioned subdictionary, this circumvents the $\widetilde{\Omega}(N/\epsilon)$ lower bound that holds in the dense, orthonormal-dictionary setting, without contradiction, by leveraging sparsity together with non-orthogonality. Beyond tomography, we analyze QOMP in the QRAM model, where it yields polynomial speedups over classical OMP implementations, and provide a quantum algorithm to estimate the mutual incoherence of a dictionary of $m$ vectors in $O(m/\epsilon)$ queries, improving over both deterministic and quantum-inspired classical methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandra Colla, Bassano Vacchini, Andrea Smirne</p>
            <p>Understanding how to assign internal energy, heat, and work in quantum systems beyond weak coupling remains a central problem in quantum thermodynamics, particularly as the difference between competing definitions becomes increasingly relevant. We identify two common sets of definitions for first-law quantities that are used to describe the thermodynamics of quantum systems coupled to thermal environments. Both are conceptually non-symmetric, treating one part of the bipartition (the "system") differently from the other (the "bath"). We analyze these in a setting where such roles are not easily assigned - two large (but finite) sets of thermal harmonic oscillators interacting with each other. We further compare them with a third set of definitions based on a local, conceptually symmetric open-system approach ("minimal dissipation") and discuss their quantitative and structural differences. In particular, we observe that all three sets of definitions differ substantially even when the two subsystems are weakly coupled and far detuned, and that the minimal dissipation approach features distinct work peaks that increase with the coupling strength.</p>

            <p>The aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum fusion mechanism for multimodal learning and to establish its theoretical and empirical potential. The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks, with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum information processing in spin-based architectures necessitates the a bility to reliably shuttle quantum states across extended device regions with minimal decoherence. In this work, we present a physics-informed algorithm for optimizing electrostatic bias equences that enable conveyor-mode electron transport in silicon-based quantum dot devices. Our approach combines self-consistent Poisson and Schrodinger solvers to maintain a constant ground state energy and enable near-constant velocity shuttling, with potential applicability to both single-electron and hole transport. We validate the algorithm across three representative technologies: Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FD-SOI), Silicon Metal-Oxide-Seminconductor (SiMOS) and Silicon-Germanium Heterostracture (Si/SiGe), highlighting key limitations and material-specific effects that influence transport fidelity. Our findings underscore the impact of gate geometry, dielectric interfaces, and quantum dot size on the stability of shuttling operations, and offer pathways toward improving coherence preservation in large-scale quantum systems.</p>

We employ the Partitioned Unitary Quantum Cellular Automaton (PUQCA), a number-conserving model, and, via evolutionary search, find solutions to the DCT where the success condition is stipulated in terms of measurement probabilities rather than convergence to fixed-point configurations. Finally, we identify a classically simulable regime of the PUQCA in which we find rules that solve the DCT at fixed system sizes and analyze their performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyue Zuo, Masoud Ghalaii, Stefano Pirandola</p>
            <p>Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</p>

            <p>We show the existence of an MA-complete homology problem for a certain subclass of simplicial complexes. The problem is defined through a new concept of orientability of simplicial complexes that we call a "uniform orientable filtration", which is related to sign-problem freeness in homology. The containment in MA is achieved through the design of new, higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes associated with the filtration. For the MA-hardness, we design a new gadget with which we can reduce from an MA-hard stoquastic satisfiability problem. Therefore, our result provides the first natural MA-complete problem for higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes, combining the concepts of topology, persistent homology, and quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Duality theorems play a fundamental role in convex optimization. Recently, it was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs, respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al., POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).</p>

Our imaging system achieves a resolution of 1.1 {\mu}m and a field-of-view of 2.5 mm. The system requires no movable parts at cryogenic temperatures and features a large working distance, thereby allowing optical and microwave probe access, as well as direct anchoring of temperature sensitive samples to a cold finger, needed for applications with high thermal load.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takao Tomono, Kazuya Tsujimura</p>
            <p>Maintenance of production equipment is critical in manufacturing. Typically, machine learning models are trained on sensor data closely attached to equipment. However, as the number of machines increases, computational cost grows rapidly. In practice, anomalies are often identified by human operators through auditory perception, relying heavily on experience and intuition. In vibration analysis, especially, AR model coefficients combined with one-class SVMs are used for detecting anomalies. In this work, we explore the effect of substituting the classical kernel in the one-class SVM with a quantum kernel. Two experimental setups were used. The first involved a miniature racing car track, where the car passes over a patch of hook-and-loop fastener to generate abnormal sounds, which are recorded using a microphone. The second involved an open-belt drive, where chopsticks are inserted at specific times to produce crushing sounds, simulating sudden anomalies. Our results show a clear advantage of quantum kernels over classical Gaussian (RBF) kernels. On the miniature car track dataset, the quantum kernel achieved an accuracy and F1-score of 0.82, compared to 0.64 and 0.39 respectively for the RBF kernel. For the crushing device, the quantum kernel achieved perfect accuracy and F1-score (1.00), while the RBF kernel reached only 0.64 accuracy and 0.43 F1-score. These findings suggest that quantum kernels enhance the classification accuracy for diverse types of abnormal sound patterns, including both periodic and impulsive anomalies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Qiao, Zu-Jian Ying</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to implement Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in a hybrid cavity optomechanical-spin system. In our system, $N$ two-level systems are coupled via Tavis-Cummings interactions to a mechanical resonator (MR) in a standard optomechanical setup. Within the dispersive coupling regime, adiabatic elimination of the optical mode induces a squeezing effect on the MR, which, in the squeezed representation, effectively transforms the collective spin operators into a Bogoliubov form. Under large detuning conditions, the phonon mode mediates interactions among the Bogoliubov collective spins, thereby enabling a two-axis twisting squeezing protocol through appropriate parameter tuning. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that in the presence of dephasing and phonon dissipation, the maximum squeezing degree asymptotically converges to a constant as $N$ increases, which implies the metrological precision asymptotically approaches the standard quantum limit without parameter optimization. Nevertheless, in parameter optimization we extract a scaling relation of the optimal squeezing which surpasses existing schemes in the literature. Moreover, the optimization also leads to a considerable reduction of the preparation time for the optimal squeezing. Our work may provide insights into dissipation effects in spin squeezing and offer a potential route for high-precision quantum metrology in many-body systems.</p>

By using this circuit decomposition, we propose a parametrized quantum comb with group symmetry, and derive the optimal quantum comb which transforms an unknown unitary operation $U \in \mathrm{SU}(d)$ to its inverse $U^\dagger$ or transpose $U^\top$. From numerics, we find a deterministic and exact unitary transposition protocol for $d=3$ with $7$ queries to $U$. This protocol improves upon the protocol shown in the previous work, which requires $13$ queries to $U$.</p>

HPQEA includes three main features: a high-performance computing core, an optimized controlled-NOT gate computation strategy, and effective utilization of high-bandwidth memory. Verification and evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error. It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution, supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources. Furthermore, it exceeds the Nvidia A100 in normalized gate speed for systems with up to 20 qubits.

What are the minimal communication resources Alice must use in order to achieve information-theoretic security? In this paper, we consider a single step of the protocol, where Alice conveys to Bob whether or not he should implement a specific gate. We use an entropy-bounding technique to quantify the minimum number of qubits that Alice must send so that Bob cannot learn anything about the gate being implemented. We provide a protocol that saturates this bound. In this optimal protocol, the states that Alice sends may be entangled. For Clifford gates, we prove that it is sufficient for Alice to send separable states.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Quality Bound on Optical Quantum Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Rippchen, Ludovico Lami, Gerardo Adesso, Mario Berta</p>
            <p>Sending quantum information reliably over long distances is a central challenge in quantum technology in general, and in quantum optics in particular, since most quantum communication relies on optical fibres or free-space links. Here, we address this problem by shifting the focus from the quantity of information sent to the quality of the transmission, i.e. the rate of decay of the transmission error with respect to the number of channel uses. For the general class of teleportation-simulable channels, which includes all channels arising in quantum optical communication, we prove that the single-letter reverse relative entropy of entanglement of the Choi state upper bounds the error exponent of two-way assisted quantum communication - paralleling the celebrated capacity bound of [Pirandola et al., Nat. Comm. (2017)] in terms of the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Remarkably, for Gaussian channels our bound can be computed efficiently through a convex program with simple constraints involving only finite-dimensional covariance matrices. As a prototypical application, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for several one-mode Gaussian channels that are fundamental to optical communication. Extending recent work [Lami et al., arXiv:2408.07067 (2024)] to infinite-dimensional systems, we further endow the reverse relative entropy of entanglement with an exact operational interpretation in entanglement testing, and show that it characterises the rate of entanglement distillation under non-entangling operations. These findings offer a new perspective on entanglement as a resource and sharpen the theoretical benchmarks for future quantum optical networks.</p>

            <h2>Preparation of initial states with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices using matrix product states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yibin Guo, Manuel Schneider, Takis Angelides, Karl Jansen, C.-J. David Lin, Yao Ting Su</p>
            <p>We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Experimental demonstration of genuine quantum information transmission through completely depolarizing channels in a superposition of cyclic orders</h2>

            <p>A major challenge in quantum communication is addressing the negative effects of noise on channel capacity, especially for completely depolarizing channels, where information transmission is inherently impossible. The concept of indefinite causal order provides a promising solution by allowing control over the sequence in which channels are applied. We experimentally demonstrate the activation of quantum communication through completely depolarizing channels using a programmable silicon photonic quantum chip. By implementing configurations based on the superposition of cyclic orders, a form of indefinite causal order, we report the first experimental realization of genuine quantum information transmission across multiple concatenated completely depolarizing channels. Our results show that when four completely depolarizing channels are combined using the superposition of cyclic orders, the fidelity of the output state is $0.712 \pm 0.013$, significantly exceeding the classical threshold of 2/3. Our work establishes indefinite causal order as a powerful tool for overcoming noise-induced limitations in quantum communication, demonstrating its potential in high-noise environments and opening new possibilities for building robust quantum networks.</p>

            <p>The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated supercon- ducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fermi Ma, Xinyu Tan, John Wright</p>
            <p>We study the error correcting properties of Haar random codes, in which a $K$-dimensional code space $\boldsymbol{C} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^N$ is chosen at random from the Haar distribution. Our main result is that Haar random codes can approximately correct errors up to the quantum Hamming bound, meaning that a set of $m$ Pauli errors can be approximately corrected so long as $mK \ll N$. This is the strongest bound known for any family of quantum error correcting codes (QECs), and continues a line of work showing that approximate QECs can significantly outperform exact QECs [LNCY97, CGS05, BGG24]. Our proof relies on a recent matrix concentration result of Bandeira, Boedihardjo, and van Handel.</p>

            <h2>MIPco=coRE</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junqiao Lin</p>
            <p>In 2020, a landmark result by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen showed that MIP*, the class of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier interacting with multiple computationally unbounded provers sharing entanglement in the tensor product model, is equal to RE. We show that the class MIPco, a complexity class defined similarly to MIP* except with provers sharing the commuting operator model of entanglement, is equal to the class coRE. This shows that giving the provers two different models of entanglement leads to two completely different computational powers for interactive proof systems. Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of MIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that the same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property in the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the compression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous framework used by Mousavi et al. [STOC 2022], as well as the improved Pauli basis test introduced by de la Salle [arXiv:2204.07084]. We introduce a new equivalence condition for RE/coRE-complete problems, which we call the weakly compressible condition. We show that both MIP* and MIPco satisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish that the uncomputability for MIP* and MIPco can be proved under a unified framework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this approach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP*=RE theorem, which does not rely on the preservation of the entanglement bound. In addition to non-local games, this new condition could also potentially be applicable to other decision problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcel Hinsche, Zongbo Bao, Philippe van Dordrecht, Jens Eisert, Jop Briët, Jonas Helsen</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of Clifford testing, which asks whether a black-box $n$-qubit unitary is a Clifford unitary or at least $\varepsilon$-far from every Clifford unitary. We give the first 4-query Clifford tester, which decides this problem with probability $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$. This contrasts with the minimum of 6 copies required for the closely-related task of stabilizer testing. We show that our tester is tolerant, by adapting techniques from tolerant stabilizer testing to our setting. In doing so, we settle in the positive a conjecture of Bu, Gu and Jaffe, by proving a polynomial inverse theorem for a non-commutative Gowers 3-uniformity norm. We also consider the restricted setting of single-copy access, where we give an $O(n)$-query Clifford tester that requires no auxiliary memory qubits or adaptivity. We complement this with a lower bound, proving that any such, potentially adaptive, single-copy algorithm needs at least $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ queries. To obtain our results, we leverage the structure of the commutant of the Clifford group, obtaining several technical statements that may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya Sriram, Vedika Khemani, Benedikt Placke</p>
            <p>Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Costs of Noise-Robust Quantum Control: Speed Limits and Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junkai Zeng, Xiu-Hao Deng</p>
            <p>Noise is ubiquitous in quantum systems and is a major obstacle for the advancement of quantum information science. Noise-robust quantum control achieves high-fidelity operations by engineering the evolution path so that first-order noise contributions cancel at the final time. Such dynamical error correction typically incurs a time overhead beyond standard quantum speed limits. We derive general lower bounds on control complexity that quantify this overhead for quasi-static coherent noise under bounded control amplitude. For a single noise source, we prove a universal time lower bound for first-order robustness and give a constructive scheme that implements any target gate robustly in time 4T plus a constant time. For robustness against an entire noise space, we show dimension lower bounds on the number M of segments in any mixed-unitary schedule from two mechanism: (i) a coherent dimension bound when the error subspace contains an irreducible block isomorphic to su(q), and (ii) a projection dimension bound when the noise space contains the trace-zero span of orthogonal projectors. Under bounded speed, these bounds on number of segments imply time lower bounds. With only local controls robust against noise space defined on a graph, we obtain a graph-orthogonality time bound scales linear with graph chromatic number. We illustrate the bounds through examples. Collectively, these results establish quantitative limitations on the feasibility of first-order noise-resilient operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Anand, Matthias C. Caro, Ari Karchmer, Saachi Mutreja</p>
            <p>Quantum learning from remotely accessed quantum compute and data must address two key challenges: verifying the correctness of data and ensuring the privacy of the learner's data-collection strategies and resulting conclusions. The covert (verifiable) learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC 2021) provides a framework for endowing classical learning algorithms with such guarantees. In this work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learning theory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remote data access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. We consider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii) target-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the unknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for making quantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms for learning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantum statistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learning from public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and for solving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and private classical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d. ancilla-free eavesdropper. The lattermost results in particular establish that the exponential separation between classical and quantum queries for Forrelation and Simon's problem survives under covertness constraints. Along the way, we design covert verifiable protocols for quantum data acquisition from public quantum queries which may be of independent interest. Overall, our models and corresponding algorithms demonstrate that quantum advantages are privately and verifiably achievable even with untrusted, remote data.</p>

            <p>Fault-tolerant Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) promise to deliver exponential speed-ups in select computational tasks, yet their integration into modern deep learning pipelines remains unclear. In this work, we take a step towards bridging this gap by presenting the first fully-coherent quantum implementation of a multilayer neural network with non-linear activation functions. Our constructions mirror widely used deep learning architectures based on ResNet, and consist of residual blocks with multi-filter 2D convolutions, sigmoid activations, skip-connections, and layer normalizations. We analyse the complexity of inference for networks under three quantum data access regimes. Without any assumptions, we establish a quadratic speedup over classical methods for shallow bilinear-style networks. With efficient quantum access to the weights, we obtain a quartic speedup over classical methods. With efficient quantum access to both the inputs and the network weights, we prove that a network with an $N$-dimensional vectorized input, $k$ residual block layers, and a final residual-linear-pooling layer can be implemented with an error of $\epsilon$ with $O(\text{polylog}(N/\epsilon)^k)$ inference cost.</p>

            <p>Over two decades ago, Bruce Kane proposed that spin-half phosphorus nuclei embedded in a spin-zero silicon substrate could serve as a viable platform for spin-based quantum computing. These nuclear spins exhibit remarkably long coherence times, making them ideal candidates for qubits. Despite this advantage, practical realisation of spin quantum computing remains a challenge. More recently, physicist Matthew Fisher proposed a hypothesis linking nuclear spin dynamics, specifically those of phosphorus nuclei within the spin-zero matrix of calcium phosphate molecules, to neural activation and, potentially, cognition. The theory has generated both interest and scepticism, with some fundamental questions remaining. We review this intersection of quantum computing and quantum biology by outlining the similarities between these models of quantum computing and quantum cognition. We then address some of the open questions and the lessons that might be learned in each context. In doing so, we highlight a promising bidirectional exchange: not only might quantum computing offer tools for understanding quantum biology, but biological models may also inspire novel strategies for quantum information processing.</p>

In particular, we use a Markov chain to efficiently sample measurements and contract the tensor network, propagating their effect forward along the spatial direction. Applications of our algorithm include validating quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications, where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.</p>

Here we show how to get away with exponentially fewer $T$ gates, at the cost of incurring a tiny $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error that can be neglected in most practical situations. More precisely, the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate can be implemented to within error $\epsilon$ in the diamond distance by a randomly chosen Clifford+$T$ circuit with at most $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ $T$ gates. We also give a matching $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$ lower bound that establishes optimality, and we show that any purely unitary implementation achieving even constant error must use $\Omega(n)$ $T$ gates. We also extend our sampling technique to implement other Boolean functions. Finally, we describe upper and lower bounds on the $T$-count of Boolean functions in terms of non-adaptive parity decision tree complexity and its randomized analogue.</p>

            <p>Efficient learning of quantum state properties is both a fundamental and practical problem in quantum information theory. Classical shadows have emerged as an efficient method for estimating properties of unknown quantum states, with rigorous statistical guarantees, by performing randomized measurement on a few number of copies. With the advent of photonic technologies, formulating efficient learning algorithms for such platforms comes out as a natural problem. Here, we introduce a classical shadow protocol for learning photonic quantum states via randomized passive linear optical transformations and photon-number measurement. We show that this scheme is efficient for a large class of observables of interest. We experimentally demonstrate our findings on a twelve-mode photonic integrated quantum processing unit. Our protocol allows for scalable learning of a wide range of photonic state properties and paves the way to applying the already rich variety of applications of classical shadows to photonic platforms.</p>

            <p>In the present article, we examine the relationship of negative conditional quantum Kaniadakis entropy ($\alpha-$CQKE) with the fully entangled fraction (FEF) which is a substantial yardstick for quantum information processing protocols including teleportation, and quantum steerability, executed over four vital quantum states with maximally mixed marginals, the 2-qubit Werner state, the 2-qubit Weyl state, the 2-qudit Werner state and the isotropic state. We initiate our analysis in 2$\otimes$2 systems where we derive implicit bounds on FEF when the $\alpha-$CQKE takes negative values, i.e. when $\alpha-$CQKE $\in$ $R^{-}$ for 2-qubit Werner state. Consequently, we derive the sufficient implicit bounds for a definitive claim on the non-usefulness of Werner state for quantum teleportation provided its visibility parameter succeeds to elude a critical region, the exception region 1, where the situation becomes inconclusive. Subsequently, we replicate the same for the 2-qubit Weyl state with some constraints augmented by an analogous exception region 2 and the correlation tensor matrix elements. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to d $\otimes$ d states, commencing our analysis with the Isotropic state. We derive implicit bounds on FEF of the Isotropic state and the 2-qudit Werner state resembling the ones in the 2$\otimes$2 analysis. Additionally, we utilize the convoluted relationship between the FEF and quantum steerability to formulate propositions linking negative $\alpha-$CQKE to the k-copy steerability of isotropic states for projective measurements, thereby reducing the intricacy of the study of k-copy steerability directly via FEF. In the appendix section of the article, we provide corroborative calculations and supplementary materials to the theorems presented in the main sections.</p>

            <p>We establish novel connections between magic in quantum circuits and communication complexity. In particular, we show that functions computable with low magic have low communication cost. Our first result shows that the $\mathsf{D}\|$ (deterministic simultaneous message passing) cost of a Boolean function $f$ is at most the number of single-qubit magic gates in a quantum circuit computing $f$ with any quantum advice state. If we allow mid-circuit measurements and adaptive circuits, we obtain an upper bound on the two-way communication complexity of $f$ in terms of the magic + measurement cost of the circuit for $f$. As an application, we obtain magic-count lower bounds of $\Omega(n)$ for the $n$-qubit generalized Toffoli gate as well as the $n$-qubit quantum multiplexer. Our second result gives a general method to transform $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous quantum messages with shared entanglement) into $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous classical messages with shared entanglement) which incurs only a polynomial blowup in the communication and entanglement complexity, provided the referee's action in the $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocol is implementable in constant $T$-depth. The resulting $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols satisfy strong privacy constraints and are $\mathsf{PSM}^*$ protocols (private simultaneous message passing with shared entanglement), where the referee learns almost nothing about the inputs other than the function value. As an application, we demonstrate $n$-bit partial Boolean functions whose $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ complexity is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and whose $\mathsf{R}$ (interactive randomized) complexity is $n^{\Omega(1)}$, establishing the first exponential separations between $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ and $\mathsf{R}$ for Boolean functions.</p>

By exploring the interplay of noise and quantum resources, we identify several computational phase transitions, revealing regimes where even modest noise levels render bosonic circuits efficiently classically simulable. In particular, our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: computational resources usually associated with bosonic quantum advantage, namely non-Gaussianity and symplectic coherence, can make the system easier to classically simulate in presence of noise.</p>

            <p>Despite extensive study, our understanding of quantum Markov chains remains far less complete than that of their classical counterparts. [Temme'13] observed that the Davies Lindbladian, a well-studied model of quantum Markov dynamics, contains an embedded classical Markov generator, raising the natural question of how the convergence properties of the quantum and classical dynamics are related. While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the Davies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical generator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then the two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain techniques to the quantum setting. The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded in terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient. Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full Davies generator.</p>

            <p>We introduce transversal dimension jump, a code-switching protocol for lifted product (LP) quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes across different chain-complex dimensions, enabling universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with low overhead. The construction leverages the product structure of LP codes to implement one-way transversal CNOTs between a 3D code and its 2D component codes, enabling teleportation-based switching. Combined with constant-depth CCZ gates in 3D LP codes and low-overhead transversal Clifford gates in 2D LP codes, this yields universal, high-rate quantum logical computation with high thresholds and low space-time costs. Beyond asymptotic schemes, we identify explicit 3D-2D LP code pairs supporting cup-product CCZ gates, including bivariate tricycle-bicycle families such as the $[[81,3,5]]$-$[[54,2,6]]$ pair, where the 3D tricycle codes admit depth-2 CCZ, weight-6 stabilizers, and pseudo-thresholds $\gtrsim 0.4\%$. As a byproduct, we show that the 3D codes enable highly efficient magic-state preparation: a single round of stabilizer measurements followed by depth-2 CCZ and postselection produces states with error $<10^{-9}$ and success probability $\sim 35\%$. Our results establish a native integration of qLDPC codes with complementary transversal gates-covering nearly all practically relevant families known so far-and open a broad design space for scalable, low-overhead universal quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive end-to-end quantum algorithm for tensor problems, including tensor PCA and planted kXOR, that achieves potential superquadratic quantum speedups over classical methods. We build upon prior works by Hastings~(\textit{Quantum}, 2020) and Schmidhuber~\textit{et al.}~(\textit{Phys.~Rev.~X.}, 2025), we address key limitations by introducing a native qubit-based encoding for the Kikuchi method, enabling explicit quantum circuit constructions and non-asymptotic resource estimation. Our approach substantially reduces constant overheads through a novel guiding state preparation technique as well as circuit optimizations, reducing the threshold for a quantum advantage. We further extend the algorithmic framework to support recovery in sparse tensor PCA and tensor completion, and generalize detection to asymmetric tensors, demonstrating that the quantum advantage persists in these broader settings. Detailed resource estimates show that 900 logical qubits, $\sim 10^{15}$ gates and $\sim 10^{12}$ gate depth suffice for a problem that classically requires $\sim 10^{23}$ FLOPs. The gate count and depth for the same problem without the improvements presented in this paper would be at least $10^{19}$ and $10^{18}$ respectively. These advances position tensor problems as a candidate for quantum advantage whose resource requirements benefit significantly from algorithmic and compilation improvements; the magnitude of the improvements suggest that further enhancements are possible, which would make the algorithm viable for upcoming fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Preparing symmetry-adapted initial states is a principal bottleneck in first-quantized quantum simulation. We present a universal approach that efficiently maps any polynomial-size superposition of occupation-number configurations to the first-quantized representation on a digital quantum computer. The method exploits the Jordan--Schwinger Lie algebra homomorphism, which identifies number-conserving second-quantized operators with their first-quantized action and induces an equivariant bijection between Fock occupations and $\mathfrak{su}(d)$ weight states within the Schur--Weyl decomposition. Operationally, we prepare an encoded superposition of Schur labels via a block-encoded linear combination of unitaries and then apply the inverse quantum Schur transform. The algorithm runs in time $\text{poly}(L, N, d, \log \epsilon^{-1})$ for $L$ configurations of $N$ particles over $d$ modes to accuracy $\epsilon$, and applies universally to fermions, bosons, and Green's paraparticles in arbitrary single-particle bases. Resource estimates indicate practicality within leading first-quantized pipelines; statistics-aware or faster quantum Schur transforms promise further reductions.</p>

            <p>Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space, evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work, we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Replica Exchange</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zherui Chen, Joao Basso, Zhiyan Ding, Lin Lin</p>
            <p>The presence of energy barriers in the state space of a physical system can lead to exponentially slow convergence for sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the classical setting, replica exchange (or parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a similar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time of quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue of the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of two replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of Hamiltonians with local energy barriers. Our main result provides a rigorous lower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which leads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier height. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples, including the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and defected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature. Our work provides a rigorous acceleration mechanism for quantum Gibbs preparation.</p>

            <h2>Fine-Grained Unambiguous Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quentin Buzet, André Chailloux</p>
            <p>Unambiguous measurements play an important role in quantum information, with applications ranging from quantum key distribution to quantum state reconstruction. Recently, such measurements have also been used in quantum algorithms based on Regev's reduction. The key problem for these algorithms is the S-LWE problem for lattice problems, or the Quantum Decoding Problem for code problems. A key idea for addressing this problem is to use unambiguous measurements to recover $k$ coordinates of a code (or lattice) element $x$ from a quantum state $|\psi_x\rangle$, which corresponds to a noisy word $x$ with errors in quantum superposition. However, a general theoretical framework to analyze this approach has been lacking. In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous measurements. Given a family of states $\{\,|\psi_x\rangle\,\}_{x\in\{0,1\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist measurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about $x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally arises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal number of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear program, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results showing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach of arXiv:2310.20651. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the Quantum Decoding Problem.</p>

            <p>Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of continuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical systems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a fundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we efficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the perspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory, characterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of the number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of copies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then extend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies suffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are far. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states necessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a fundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on rotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently introduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds.</p>

            <h2>Modeling amortization systems with vector spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Sebastian Ardenghi</p>
            <p>Amortization systems are used widely in economy to generate payment schedules to repaid an initial debt with its interest. We present a generalization of these amortization systems by introducing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics based on vector spaces. Operators are defined for debt, amortization, interest and periodic payment and their mean values are computed in different orthonormal basis. The vector space of the amortization system will have dimension M, where M is the loan maturity and the vectors will have a SO(M) symmetry, yielding the possibility of rotating the basis of the vector space while preserving the distance among vectors. The results obtained are useful to add degrees of freedom to the usual amortization systems without affecting the interest profits of the lender while also benefitting the borrower who is able to alter the payment schedules. Furthermore, using the tensor product of algebras, we introduce loans entanglement in which two borrowers can correlate the payment schedules without altering the total repaid.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Pricing Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Xin</p>
            <p>Motivated by Heisenberg's observable-only stance, we replace latent "information" (filtrations, hidden diffusions, state variables) with observable transitions between price states. On a discrete price lattice with a Hilbert-space representation, shift operators and the spectral calculus of the price define observable frequency operators and a translation-invariant convolution generator. Combined with jump operators that encode transition intensities, this yields a completely positive, translation-covariant Lindblad semigroup. Under the risk-neutral condition the framework leads to a nonlocal pricing equation that is diagonal in Fourier space; in the small-mesh diffusive limit its generator converges to the classical Black-Scholes-Merton operator. We do not propose another parametric model. We propose a foundation for model construction that is observable, first-principles, and mathematically natural. Noncommutativity emerges from the observable shift algebra rather than being postulated. The jump-intensity ledger determines tail behavior and short-maturity smiles and implies testable links between extreme-event probabilities and implied-volatility wings. Future directions: (i) multi-asset systems on higher-dimensional lattices with vector shifts and block kernels; (ii) state- or flow-dependent kernels as "financial interactions" leading to nonlinear master equations while preserving linear risk-neutral pricing; (iii) empirical tests of the predicted scaling relations between jump intensities and market extremes.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengjie Yang, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>A doubly composite Chernoff-Stein lemma and its applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>Given a sequence of random variables $X^n=X_1,\ldots, X_n$, discriminating between two hypotheses on the underlying probability distribution is a key task in statistics and information theory. Of interest here is the Stein exponent, i.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a vanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and i.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative entropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of this result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings where the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but rather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components taken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that applies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely correlated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both hypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either hypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved using a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2025]. In this refined form, blurring is applied symbol by symbol, which makes it both stronger and applicable also in the absence of permutational symmetry. The second part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter formula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad families of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying alternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction' statement that covers a wide family of convex constraints. Applications to quantum hypothesis testing are explored in a related paper [Lami, arXiv:today].</p>

            <h2>Emergent Mixed States for Baby Universes and Black Holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonah Kudler-Flam, Edward Witten</p>
            <p>We examine the behavior of sequences of states in the large $N$ limit of AdS/CFT duality in cases in which the bulk duals involve baby universes or black holes. Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby universe.</p>

            <h2>Twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, anomaly index, and generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems with anti-unitary symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruizhi Liu, Jinmin Yi, Liujun Zou</p>
            <p>Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices, which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state, as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions, the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general theorems in various concrete examples.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.</p>

            <h2>Noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward McCann</p>
            <p>By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.</p>

            <h2>Towards Nonperturbative Solution of Quantum Dynamics : A Hamiltonian Mean Field Approximation Scheme with Perturbation Theory for Arbitray Strength of Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. P. Mahapatra</p>
            <p>We introduce a non perturbative general approximation scheme (NGAS) that can handle interactions of any strength in quantum theory. This approach starts with an input Hamiltonian that can be solved exactly. The interaction effects are then built into this Hamiltonian through nonlinear feedback enforced by self consistency conditions. While the method itself is nonperturbative it can be systematically improved using a new perturbation method called 'mean field perturbation theory' which does not involve power series expansion in any small parameter. We put this scheme to the test on one dimensional anharmonic interactions using the harmonic approximation. The results are consistently accurate across various cases including quartic, sextic, and octic anharmonic oscillators, as well as the quartic double well oscillator (QDWO) even when the coupling strength varies widely. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated when we swap the input Hamiltonian for that of an infinite square well and still achieve comparable accuracy. When applied to the {\lambda}{\phi}4 quantum field theory this approach aligns with the Gaussian effective potential method under the harmonic approximation. Beyond that it reveals the condensate structure of the effective vacuum and highlights the instability of the perturbative ground state. Notably, our ground-state energy results for the QDWO stand in stark contrast to those from standard perturbation theory where Borel summation fails regardless of coupling strength.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahana Chakraborty, Michele Pini, Martina S. Zündel, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device.

            <p>This work investigates the family of extended tilted-CHSH inequalities in the single-prover cryptographic compiled setting. In particular, we show that a quantum polynomial-time prover can violate these Bell inequalities by at most negligibly more than the violation achieved by two non-communicating quantum provers. To obtain this result, we extend a sum-of-squares technique to monomials with arbitrarily high degree in the Bob operators and degree at most one in the Alice operators. We also introduce a notion of partial self-testing for the compiled setting, which resembles a weaker form of self-testing in the bipartite setting. As opposed to certifying the full model, partial self-testing attempts to certify the reduced states and measurements on separate subsystems. In the compiled setting, this is akin to the states after the first round of interaction and measurements made on that state. Lastly, we show that the extended tilted-CHSH inequalities satisfy this notion of a compiled self-test.</p>

            <p>The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</p>

            <p>Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.</p>

Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group.

            <p>We present a quantum solver for partial differential equations based on a flexible matrix product operator representation. Utilizing mid-circuit measurements and a state-dependent norm correction, this scheme overcomes the restriction of unitary operators. Hence, it allows for the direct implementation of a broad class of differential equations governing the dynamics of classical and quantum systems. The capabilities of the framework are demonstrated for linear and non-linear partial differential equations using the example of the linearized Euler equations with absorbing boundaries and the nonlinear Burgers' equation. For a turbulence data set, we demonstrate potential advantages of the quantum tensor scheme over its classical counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Onset of Quantum Chaos and Ergodicity in Spin Systems with Highly Degenerate Hilbert Spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Rubem Mondaini, Marcos Rigol</p>
            <p>We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasiconserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing crossover to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the crossover.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Monitoring of Multimode Squeezing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Kalash, Aditya Sudharsanam, M. H. M. Passos, Valentina Parigi, Maria Chekhova</p>
            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enhancing metrological sensitivity, boosting communication security, and enabling parallel processing in computation. Its practical potential, however, remains constrained by the inherent single-mode operation of homodyne detection, necessitating post-processing for multimode characterization. Here, we overcome this long-standing challenge by employing multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA), enabling loss-tolerant direct detection of squeezing in each mode, which in turn permits mode sorting after amplification. As a result, we demonstrate, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the real-time monitoring of multimode squeezing. With a spatial light modulator sorting the modes, we simultaneously measure squeezing in nine spatial modes co-propagating within one beam. Although mode sorting and filtering reduce the detection efficiency to less than $0.3\%$, we observe high-purity squeezing of up to $-7.9 \pm 0.6$ dB -- to the best of our knowledge, the highest squeezing recorded for pulsed light. Furthermore, we demonstrate real-time, loss-tolerant characterization of continuous-variable entanglement and extend it to the detection of cluster states. Similar methods can be applied in the frequency domain, facilitating a crucial capability for scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Finite Size and Large Depth and Equivalence to Quantum Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sami Boulebnane, James Sud, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing are two of the most popular quantum optimization heuristics. While QAOA is known to be able to approximate quantum annealing, the approximation requires QAOA angles to vanish with the problem size $n$, whereas optimized QAOA angles are observed to be size-independent for small $n$ and constant in the infinite-size limit. This fact led to a folklore belief that QAOA has a mechanism that is fundamentally different from quantum annealing. In this work, we provide evidence against this by analytically showing that QAOA energy approximates that of quantum annealing under two conditions, namely that angles vary smoothly from one layer to the next and that the sum is bounded by a constant. These conditions are known to hold for near-optimal QAOA angles empirically. Our proof relies on a series expansion of QAOA energy in sum of angles, which we show converges to quantum annealing limit as QAOA depth grows for constant sum of angles even if angles do not vanish with problem size $n$. A corollary of our results is a quadratic improvement for the bound on depth required to compile Trotterized quantum annealing of the SK model in the average case.</p>

            <h2>From Quantum-Mechanical Acceleration Limits to Upper Bounds on Fluctuation Growth of Observables in Unitary Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Cafaro, Walid Redjem, Paul M. Alsing, Newshaw Bahreyni, Christian Corda</p>
            <p>Quantum Speed Limits (QSLs) are fundamentally linked to the tenets of quantum mechanics, particularly the energy-time uncertainty principle. Notably, the Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) bound and the Margolus-Levitin (ML) bound are prominent examples of QSLs. Recently, the notion of a quantum acceleration limit has been proposed for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems governed by arbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. This limit articulates that the rate of change over time of the standard deviation of the Hamiltonian operator-representing the acceleration of quantum evolution within projective Hilbert space-is constrained by the standard deviation of the time-derivative of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we extend our earlier findings to encompass any observable A within the framework of unitary quantum dynamics. This relationship signifies that the speed of the standard deviation of any observable is limited by the standard deviation of its associated velocity-like observable. Finally, for pedagogical purposes, we illustrate the relevance of our inequality by providing clear examples. We choose suitable observables related to the unitary dynamics of two-level quantum systems, as well as a harmonic oscillator within a finite-dimensional Fock space.</p>

            <p>We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</p>

            <h2>Isoprobability Models of Qubit Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov</p>
            <p>Efficient quantum control is a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum technologies, from computation to sensing and communications. Several approaches in quantum control, e.g. optimal control and inverse engineering, use pulse amplitude and frequency shaping as control tools. Often, these approaches prescribe pulse shapes which are difficult or impossible to implement. To this end, we develop the concept of isoprobability classes of models of qubit dynamics, in which various pairs of time-dependent pulse amplitude and frequency generate the same transition probability profile (albeit different temporal evolutions toward this probability). In this manner, we introduce an additional degree of freedom, and hence flexibility in qubit control. Selection of hardware-aware temporal pulse shapes has the potential to decrease gate duration, overcome platform constraints and increase robustness to noise. We demonstrate this approach with two classes of isoprobability models, which derive from the established Landau-Majorana-Stückelberg-Zener (LMSZ) and Allen-Eberly-Hioe (AEH) classes. We experimentally validate the isoprobability equivalence on an IBM Quantum processor, quantifying agreement with numerical simulations via the mean squared error (MSE). Instead of frequency (i.e. detuning) shaping, which is difficult to implement on this platform, we exploit the time-dependent phase of the driving field to induce an effective detuning. Indeed, the temporal derivative of the phase function emulates a variable detuning, thereby avoiding the need for direct detuning control. The experimental validation of the isoprobability concept with the time-dependent phase control underscores the potential of this robust and accessible method for high-fidelity quantum operations, bringing us one step closer to scalable quantum control in various quantum applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Heightman, Edward Jiang, Ruth Mora-Soto, Maciej Lewenstein, Marcin Płodzień</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present an experimental deployment of a new design for combined quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Novel to our system is the dynamic obfuscation of the QKD-PQC sequence of operations, the number of operations, and parameters related to the operations; coupled to the integration of a GPS-free quantum synchronization protocol within the QKD process. We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption, demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.</p>

            <p>A quantum memory for light is expected to play a crucial role in quantum communication protocols and distributed quantum computing. In addition to storage and buffering, a quantum memory can be used for manipulations of stored states to allow more complex quantum network operations. In this work, we demonstrate an in-memory Fourier transform using a combination of two well-established quantum memory protocols: Gradient Echo Memory and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser cooled in an elongated magneto-optic trap to maximise optical depth. The results of our time-frequency Fourier transform can be understood as a temporal double slit. We show that the interference between time-separated pulses depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring similar capability to quantum optical systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal Precision Limits in General Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tan Van Vu, Ryotaro Honma, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems that interact with their environments at arbitrary coupling strengths and are subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained not only by entropy production but also by this asymmetry. For general observables, we further prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term that characterizes environmental changes. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental limits of precision in a broad class of open quantum systems, beyond the traditional Markovian setting.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We study the emergence of local reminiscence in the PXP model, a constrained spin system realized in Rydberg atom arrays. The spectrum of this model is characterized by a majority of eigenstates that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, alongside a set of nonthermal eigenstates, known as quantum many-body scars, that violate it. While generic initial states lead to thermalization consistent with eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, special configurations generate non-ergodic dynamics and preserve memory of the initial state. In this work, we explore local memory retention using local fidelity and the dynamics of local observables. We find that two specific states, $\theta$-symmetric and blockaded states, exhibit robust local reminiscence, with fidelities near unity and suppressed fluctuations as the system size increases. Our results show that non-ergodic regimes can sustain stable local memory while still allowing for complex global dynamics, providing new insights into quantum many-body scars and constrained dynamics.</p>

            <p>We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing general physical processes. These QSLs were obtained using two families of entropic measures, namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which in turn defines a faithful distance of quantum states, and the square root of the quantum Jeffreys divergence. The results apply to both closed and open quantum systems, and are evaluated in terms of the Schatten speed of the evolved state, as well as cost functions that depend on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of both initial and instantaneous states of the quantum system. To illustrate our findings, we focus on the unitary and nonunitary dynamics of mixed single-qubit states. In the first case, we obtain speed limits $\textit{à la}$ Mandelstam-Tamm that are inversely proportional to the variance of the Hamiltonian driving the evolution. In the second case, we set the nonunitary dynamics to be described by the noisy operations: depolarizing channel, phase damping channel, and generalized amplitude damping channel. We provide analytical results for the two entropic measures, present numerical simulations to support our results on the speed limits, comment on the tightness of the bounds, and provide a comparison with previous QSLs. Our results may find applications in the study of quantum thermodynamics, entropic uncertainty relations, and also complexity of many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Running quantum circuits on quantum computers does not always generate "clean" results, unlike on a simulator, as noise plays a significant role in any quantum device. To explore this, we experimented with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on quantum simulators and real quantum hardware. QAOA is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and requires hundreds or thousands of independent executions of the quantum circuit for optimization, which typically goes beyond the publicly available resources for quantum computing. We were granted access to the IBM Quantum System One at the Cleveland Clinic, the first on-premises IBM system in the U.S. This paper explores different optimization methods, techniques, and error mitigation methods to observe how they react to quantum noise differently, which is helpful for other researchers to understand the complexities of running QAOA on real quantum hardware and the challenges faced in dealing with noise.</p>

            <p>Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.</p>

PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification.

This aligns with the alternative quantum unique games conjecture on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label cover problem proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25). Our techniques employ a series of reductions from the halting problem to the quantum smooth label cover problem, and include a quantum-sound version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5 (STOC'96), which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Quantum annealing provides a practical realization of adiabatic quantum computation and has emerged as a promising approach for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, current devices remain constrained by sparse hardware connectivity, which requires embedding logical variables into chains of physical qubits. This embedding overhead limits scalability and reduces reliability as longer chains are more prone to noise-induced errors. In this work, building on the known structural result that the average chain length in clique embeddings grows linearly with the problem size, we develop a mathematical framework that connects embedding-induced overhead with hardware noise in D-Wave's Zephyr topology. Our analysis derives closed-form expressions for chain break probability and chain break fraction under a Gaussian control error model, establishing how noise scales with embedding size and how chain strength should be adjusted with chain length to maintain reliability. Experimental results from the Zephyr topology-based quantum processing unit confirm the accuracy of these predictions, demonstrating both the validity of the theoretical noise model and the practical relevance of the derived scaling rule. Beyond validating a theoretical model against hardware data, our findings establish a general embedding-aware noise framework that explains the trade-off between chain stability and logical coupler fidelity. Our framework advances the understanding of noise amplification in current devices and provides quantitative guidance for embedding-aware parameter tuning strategies.</p>

            <p>Post-selection strategies that discard low-confidence computational results can significantly improve the effective fidelity of quantum error correction at the cost of reduced acceptance rates, which can be particularly useful for offline resource state generation. Prior work has primarily relied on the "logical gap" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%). Additionally, we integrate our approach with the sliding-window framework for real-time decoding, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions that eliminate unnecessary overheads. Notably, its performance matches or even surpasses the original strategy for global decoding, while exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds. Our approach provides a practical foundation for efficient post-selection in fault-tolerant quantum computing with QLDPC codes.</p>

            <p>In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout, requiring only two bound spins for its implementation. In conjunction with charge sensing techniques, SB has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect selectively different spin measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin-selective readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1 - 8 $\mu$s. Our method should help perform projective spin measurements with high spin-to-charge conversion fidelity in systems subject to strong SOC, will facilitate state leakage detection and enable complete readout of two-spin states.</p>

            <p>The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</p>

            <p>Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Norihiro Iizuka, Akihiro Miyata, Mitsuhiro Nishida</p>
            <p>The Markov gap, defined as the difference between reflected entropy and mutual information, serves as a diagnostic for quantum recoverability and multipartite entanglement. In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</h2>

            <p>We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</p>

            <h2>A Calibration-Free Fixed Point of Curved Boolean Logic Matching the Fine-Structure Constant</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian R. P. von Liechtenstein</p>
            <p>We show that Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) admits a calibration-free fixed point at which the per-face holonomy theta_0 is the same across independent minimal faces (CHSH, KCBS, SAT_6). Equality is enforced by solving the two-component system F(delta, gamma_4, gamma_5, gamma_6) = (theta_0^(4) - theta_0^(5), theta_0^(5) - theta_0^(6)) = 0 with a Gauss-Newton method (no external scale). A finite-difference Jacobian is full rank at the solution, implying local uniqueness. Working at the coupling level g = |theta_0|/(2*pi*n) removes hidden length factors; at the equality point our normalization audit shows g = alpha (Thomson limit) within numerical tolerance. The SU(1,1) corner words and overlap placements used to compute theta_0 are specified exactly; we also report a variational minimax analysis on g and a pilot non-backtracking spectral density that coincides numerically with the per-edge coupling, suggesting a purely topological formulation. Scope: the match is to the low-energy (Thomson) limit; a full spectral equality on the contextual complex is left as a short conjecture. These results promote the CBL--alpha connection from a calibrated identification to a calibration-free derivation candidate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Sandfuchs, Carla Ferradini, Renato Renner</p>
            <p>We consider a pair of causally independent processes, modelled as the tensor product of two channels, acting on a possibly correlated input to produce random outputs X and Y. We show that, assuming the processes produce a sufficient amount of randomness, one can extract uniform randomness from X and Y. This generalizes prior results, which assumed that X and Y are (conditionally) independent. Note that in contrast to the independence of quantum states, the independence of channels can be enforced through spacelike separation. As a consequence, our results allow for the generation of randomness under more practical and physically justifiable assumptions than previously possible. We illustrate this with the example of device-independent randomness amplification, where we can remove the constraint that the adversary only has access to classical side information about the source.</p>

            <h2>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</h2>

            <p>Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</p>

            <p>A key issue of current quantum advantage experiments is that their verification requires a full classical simulation of the ideal computation. This limits the regime in which the experiments can be verified to precisely the regime in which they are also simulatable. An important outstanding question is therefore to find quantum advantage schemes that are also classically verifiable. We make progress on this question by designing a new quantum advantage proposal--Hidden Code Sampling--whose output distribution is conditionally peaked. These peaks enable verification in far less time than it takes for full simulation. At the same time, we show that exactly sampling from the output distribution is classically hard unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, and we propose a plausible conjecture regarding average-case hardness. Our scheme is based on ideas from quantum error correction. The required quantum computations are closely related to quantum fault-tolerant circuits and can potentially be implemented transversally. Our proposal may thus give rise to a next generation of quantum advantage experiments en route to full quantum fault tolerance.</p>

Additionally these beams allow trapping of larger particles outside the Rayleigh regime using both bright and dark tweezer trapping with reduced recoil heating. By changing the wavelength of the trapping laser, or the size of the particles, non-linear and repulsive potentials of interest for the creation of non-classical states of motion can also be created.</p>

            <p>The generation of entangled photons through Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a critical resource for many key experiments and technologies in the domain of quantum optics. Historically, SPDC was limited to the generation of photon pairs. However, the use of the strong nonlinearities in circuit quantum electrodynamics has recently enabled the observation of Three-Photon SPDC (3P-SPDC). Despite great interest in the entanglement structure of the resultant states, entanglement between photon triplets produced by a 3P-SPDC source has still has not been confirmed. Here, we report on the observation of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in the steady-state output field of a 3P-SPDC source consisting of a superconducting parametric cavity coupled to a transmission line. We study this non-Gaussian tripartite entanglement using an entanglement witness built from three-mode correlation functions, and observe a maximum violation of the bound by 23 standard deviations of the statistical noise. Furthermore, we find strong agreement between the observed and the analytically predicted scaling of the entanglement witness. We then explore the impact of the temporal function used to define the photon mode on the observed value of the entanglement witness.</p>

These radicals, generated through photoreduction, are optically identifiable and stable on timescales exceeding an hour. We experimentally demonstrate their coherent manipulation and detection using single, shallow NV centers for readout. We observe heterogeneity in the local magnetic environments of the photoactivated spins from site to site, likely due to variations in inter-radical couplings across our measurements. Looking forward, our approach enables correlative nanoscale magnetic and optical imaging, and opens new pathways toward single-molecule magnetic resonance studies.</p>

            <p>Magnetic response measurements in the presence of AC drive fields provide critical insight into the properties of magnetic and conductive materials, such as phase transitions in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets, the heating efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles in biological environments, and the integrity of metals in eddy current testing. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a commonly-used platform for such studies, due to their high spatial resolution and sensitivity, but are typically limited to weak-drive conditions, i.e., AC drive fields well below the NV microwave (MW) pulse Rabi strength. Once the AC drive field grows comparable to or larger than the Rabi strength, the induced MW pulse detuning suppresses NV sensitivity to the out-of-phase magnetic response, which encodes dissipation and conductivity in materials of interest. Here, we introduce a phase modulation protocol that cancels MW pulse detuning to leading order, and extends NV AC magnetometry into the strong drive field regime. The protocol, termed SIPHT (Signal Isolation through PHase Tuning), is experimentally demonstrated using an NV ensemble. By directly comparing SIPHT to the conventional Hahn echo AC sensing protocol, we quantify the preservation of NV magnetometry contrast for an out-of-phase signal. We further showcase SIPHT by detecting eddy current-induced magnetic fields from Cu, Al, and Ti samples, with the measured response field phase delays reflecting their distinct conductivities. SIPHT extends NV AC magnetometry to regimes inaccessible to standard dynamical decoupling measurement protocols, unlocking novel utility, e.g., in the study of magnetic hyperthermia and nondestructive testing of conductors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Regression Theory and Efficient Computation of Response Functions for Non-Markovian Open Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiantao Li, Chunhao Wang</p>
            <p>Linear response functions are a cornerstone concept in physics as they enable efficient estimation of many dynamical properties. In addition to predicting dynamics of observables under perturbations without resimulating the system, these response functions lead to electric conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, dielectric constants, etc. Estimating two-time correlation functions is a key ingredient of measuring linear response functions. However, for open quantum systems, simulating the reduced density operator with a quantum master equation only yields \emph{one-point} observables and is insufficient for this task. In this paper, we develop a memoryless, system-only formulation of two-point correlations for open quantum systems that extends the standard quantum regression theorem (QRT) beyond the Markov limit. We further incorporate the spectral property of the bath and express the time propagators in the response function as the memoryless generators in Lindblad-type forms. The resulting expressions recast the total response function into evolutions generated by time-dependent Hamiltonian and Lindblad primitives together with the more challenging propagation of commutators and anti-commutators. In addition to the derivation of the new QRT, we present quantum algorithms for these primitives and obtain an estimator for two-time correlations whose cost scales poly-logarithmically in the system dimension and $1/\epsilon^{1.25}$ in the target accuracy $\epsilon$. The framework removes the separability (Born-Markov) assumption and offers a pathway to efficient computation of nonequilibrium properties from open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The dark-state effect, caused by destructive quantum interference, is an important physical effect in atomic physics and quantum optics. It not only deepens the understanding of light-atom interactions, but also has wide application in quantum physics and quantum information. Therefore, how to efficiently and conveniently determine the number and form of the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with complex transitions is an important and interesting topic in this field. In this work, we present a general theory for determining the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with any coupling configuration using the arrowhead-matrix method. To confirm the dark states in a multilevel system, we first define the upper- and lower-state subspaces, and then diagonalize the Hamiltonians restricted within the two subspaces to obtain the dressed upper and lower states. By further expressing the transitions between the dressed upper and lower states, we can map the multilevel system to a bipartite-graph network, in which the nodes and links are acted by the dressed states and transitions, respectively. Based on the coupling configurations of the network, we can determine the lower dark states with respect to the upper-state subspace. As examples, we analyze the dark states in three-, four-, and five-level quantum systems, for all possible configurations through the classification of the numbers of upper and lower states. Further, we extend the framework to multilevel quantum systems and discuss the existence of dark states in some typical configurations. We also recover the results of the dark-state polaritons in driven three-level systems with the arrowhead-matrix method. Our theory paves the way for manipulating and utilizing the dark states of multilevel quantum systems in modern quantum science and technology.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum systems play a crucial role in advancing scalable and versatile quantum networks as they combine the strengths of different quantum platforms. An important challenge for the development of hybrid quantum networks lies in interfacing heterogeneous quantum nodes and distributing entanglement among them. Single photons emitted from these dissimilar quantum nodes typically show distinct spectral and temporal properties. Therefore, they necessitate spectral filtering and temporal synchronization, which introduce significant photon losses and require additional resources. In this work, we successfully generate indistinguishable photons from two distinct quantum systems of a warm atomic ensemble and a solid-state quantum dot. Remarkably, quantum interference between dissimilar sources is achieved without additional spectral filtering and time synchronization, which enables autonomous quantum nodes for a hybrid quantum network. 133Cs atomic ensemble can efficiently generate heralded single photons at the wavelength of 917 nm of the 6P_(3/2)-6D_(5/2) transition, while the single photons emitted from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot can be tuned to match the 133Cs transition wavelength. Our dense warm atomic ensemble and cavity-coupled quantum dot can efficiently generate bright and resonant single photons at detection rates approaching MHz, respectively. More importantly, these single photons exhibit inherent spectral similarities not only in the wavelength but also in the spectral linewidth, achieving a high spectral overlap of 0.92. Such intrinsic compatibility between dissimilar quantum sources is essential to leverage the advantages of different quantum platforms, paving the way toward a large-scale and functional hybrid quantum network.</p>

Second, generation of the entanglement as well as destruction are analyzed by monitoring the reduced dynamics during and after application of a $\sqrt{\mbox{iSWAP}^\dagger}$ gate, also focusing on memory effects caused by reservoirs. Finally, the performance of a Hadamard + CNOT sequence is analyzed for different gate decomposition schemes.

            <p>Motivated by shortcuts to adiabaticity, we develop a framework that combines inverse engineering with time-dependent perturbation theory to implement non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computing (NHQC) in qutrit systems under realistic error sources. We derive analytical conditions that suppress second-order Rabi errors through tailored pulse parameters and eliminate detuning errors via a compensation pulse. Our analysis reveals the cancellation from the compensation pulse, which ensures robust gate operations. The proposed approach, broadly applicable to superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and atom-based platforms, provides a pathway to fast and error-resilient holonomic gates, potentially for scalable quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Quantumness and its hierarchies in PT-symmetric down-conversion models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Peřina Jr., Karol Bartkiewicz, Grzegorz Chimczak, Anna Kowalewska-Kudlaszyk, Adam Miranowicz, Joanna K. Kalaga, Wiesław Leonski</p>
            <p>We investigate the hierarchy of quantum correlations in a quadratic bosonic parity-time-symmetric system (PTSS) featuring distinct dissipation and amplification channels. The hierarchy includes global nonclassicality, entanglement, asymmetric quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality. We elucidate the interplay between the system physical nonlinearity -- which serves as a source of quantumness -- and the specific dynamics of bosonic PTSSs, which are qualitatively influenced by their damping and amplification characteristics. Using a set of quantifiers -- including local and global nonclassicality depths, negativity, steering parameters, and the Bell parameter -- we demonstrate that the standard PTSS typically exhibits weaker quantumness than its counterparts affected solely by damping or solely by amplification. Both the maximum values attained by these quantifiers and the speed and duration of their generation are generally lower in the standard PTSS. A comparative analysis of three two-mode PTSSs -- standard, passive, and active -- with identical eigenvectors and real parts of eigenfrequencies, but differing in their damping and amplification strengths, reveals the crucial role of quantum fluctuations associated with gain and loss. Among them, the passive PTSS yields the most strongly nonclassical states. Nevertheless, under suitable conditions, the standard PTSS can also generate highly nonclassical states. The supremacy of the passive PTSS is further supported by its fundamental advantages in practical realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongkun Chen, Daohong Xu, Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, Jeff D. Thompson, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</p>

            <h2>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-Huang Chen</p>
            <p>We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations.</p>

            <p>We explore the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of superconducting aluminum thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates at cryogenic temperatures of 6 K and compare their behavior with films synthesized at room temperature. We demonstrate that cryogenic growth increases structural disorder, producing crystalline grains that modify the optical, electrical, and superconducting properties of aluminum. We observe that cryogenic deposition changes the color of aluminum from fully reflective to yellow and correlate the pseudo-dielectric function and reflectance with structural changes in the film. We find that smaller grain sizes enhance the superconductivity of aluminum, increasing its critical temperature and critical field. We then estimate the superconducting gap and coherence length of Cooper pairs in aluminum in the presence of disorder. Finally, we fabricate superconducting microwave resonators on these films and find that, independently of the growth temperature, the system is dominated by two-level system loss with similar quality factors in the high and low power regimes. We further measure a higher kinetic inductance in the cryogenically grown films.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Magic State Cultivation on the Surface Code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yotam Vaknin, Shoham Jacoby, Arne Grimsmo, Alex Retzker</p>
            <p>Magic state cultivation is a newly proposed protocol that represents the state of the art in magic state generation. It uses the transversality of the $H_{XY}$ gate on the 2D triangular color-code, together with a novel grafting mechanism to transform the color-code into a matchable code with minimal overhead. Still, the resulting code has a longer cycle time and some high weight stabilizers. Here, we introduce three new cultivation protocols, each yielding a different magic state. These protocols avoid grafting by exploiting transversal operations on the surface code using non-local connectivity, allowing for a much lower post-selection rates in the expansion process. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our protocol achieves state-of-the-art infidelities and acceptance rates for magic state generation, on par with another recent proposal on the $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code, while still preserving the local geometry of the surface code. Moreover, in platforms such as cold atoms and trapped ions, where idle error rates are lower than two-qubit gate errors, we demonstrate that cultivation exhibits an even greater advantage, yielding an additional order-of-magnitude reduction in resource requirements. Lastly, we analyze the effect of erasure qubits on cultivation and show that \emph{algorithmically-relevant} infidelities can be achieved using only 9 erasure qubits on a distance-2 surface code with a single cultivation round.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Xu Lu, Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yintai Zhang, Aritra Sinha, Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga</p>
            <p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Mechanisms for Quantum Advantage in Global Optimization of Nonconvex Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan Herman, Guneykan Ozgul, Anuj Apte, Junhyung Lyle Kim, Anupam Prakash, Jiayu Shen, Shouvanik Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>We present new theoretical mechanisms for quantum speedup in the global optimization of nonconvex functions, expanding the scope of quantum advantage beyond traditional tunneling-based explanations. As our main building-block, we demonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of Schrödinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion. This correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with unique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original potential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schrödinger operators with a WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these ideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves provably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex functions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains polynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential time and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial runtimes. These results leverage novel non-asymptotic results in semiclassical analysis. Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic hypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately perturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while off-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to prior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the geometry of barriers between local minima. Our theoretical claims about classical algorithm runtimes are supported by rigorous analysis and comprehensive numerical benchmarking. These findings establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for quantum advantage in continuous optimization and open new research directions connecting quantum algorithms, stochastic processes, and semiclassical analysis.</p>

            <h2>Quantum feature-map learning with reduced resource overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Jäger, Philipp Elsässer, Elham Torabian</p>
            <p>Current quantum computers require algorithms that use limited resources economically. In quantum machine learning, success hinges on quantum feature maps, which embed classical data into the state space of qubits. We introduce Quantum Feature-Map Learning via Analytic Iterative Reconstructions (Q-FLAIR), an algorithm that reduces quantum resource overhead in iterative feature-map circuit construction. It shifts workloads to a classical computer via partial analytic reconstructions of the quantum model, using only a few evaluations. For each probed gate addition to the ansatz, the simultaneous selection and optimization of the data feature and weight parameter is then entirely classical. Integrated into quantum neural network and quantum kernel support vector classifiers, Q-FLAIR shows state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Since resource overhead decouples from feature dimension, we train a quantum model on a real IBM device in only four hours, surpassing 90% accuracy on the full-resolution MNIST dataset (784 features, digits 3 vs 5). Such results were previously unattainable, as the feature dimension prohibitively drives hardware demands for fixed and search costs for adaptive ansätze. By rethinking feature-map learning beyond black-box optimization, this work takes a concrete step toward enabling quantum machine learning for real-world problems and near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Precision sensing and imaging of weak static magnetic fields are crucial for a variety of emerging nanoscale applications. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide exceptional AC magnetic field sensitivity with nanoscale spatial resolution, their sensitivity to static (DC) magnetic fields is fundamentally limited by the short dephasing time (T2*) due to spin-spin interactions. In this work, we present a novel hybrid sensing approach that integrates a soft ferromagnetic microwire with a single near-surface NV center to amplify its response to external static magnetic fields. This hybrid configuration achieves a DC magnetic field sensitivity of 63 nT/sqrt(Hz) for a single NV center - about 500 times greater than conventional inhomogeneous broadening- or T2*-limited magnetometry, with potential for further enhancement. The compact and highly sensitive nature of this sensor opens new opportunities for quantum sensing applications involving the detection of static or slowly varying magnetic fields across diverse scientific and technological domains.</p>

Quantum Hamiltonian simulation provides a framework to encode PDEs into unitary time evolution and has potential for scalable electromagnetic analysis.

A key bottleneck is the exponential growth of Hamiltonian terms for complex geometries; we examine this issue and show that logical compression can substantially mitigate it, especially for periodic or symmetric structures. As a proof of concept, we simulate optical wave propagation through a metalens and illustrate that the method can capture wavefront shaping and focusing behavior, suggesting its applicability to design optimization tasks. This work highlights the feasibility of Hamiltonian-based quantum simulation for photonic systems and identifies structural conditions favorable for efficient execution.</p>

            <p>The diamond sensor has emerged as a promising platform for quantum sensing, enabling the estimation of physical quantities -- such as microwave~(MW) field -- with precision unattainable by classical counterpart. However, traditional diamond sensors suffer severe precision degradation when the signal MW is not resonant with the sensor transition frequency. Here, we propose and demonstrate a Floquet diamond sensor~(FDS) for high-precision off-resonant MW amplitude sensing without attenuating the strength of the signal MW. The periodic driven field effectively induces an quasi-energy shift that matches the off-resonant MW frequency. The measurement precision of FDS is characterized by quantum Fisher information, which approaches the ultimate precision -- Heisenberg limit -- within the coherent time. Furthermore, the FDS exhibits robust tolerance to practical control errors and is compatible with dynamical coupling protocol, enabling a robust and high-sensitivity magnetic sensing. Our results confirm the quantum advantage of quantum sensing and provide a practical technology for high-precision off-resonant MW sensing.</p>

For SPDC, by tuning the pump wavelength to 775~nm, 780~nm, and 785~nm, we achieve broadband photon-pair generation with a maximum full bandwidth and brightness up to 99~THz~(846~nm) and 20~GHz/mW/nm, respectively.

            <p>The polarization-entangled photon source (PEPS) at non-degenerated wavelengths is pivotal to connect quantum systems working at different wavelengths, with the assistance of quantum teleportation. Here, a compact Sagnac-type photon source is designed and demonstrated, in which two photons with wavelengths at 810 and 1550~nm are highly entangled in polarization degree of freedom. The two photons are generated from a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal pumped with a 532~nm continuous-wave laser, via type-0 nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The polarization of three lights is rotated by a single periscope, which makes the Sagnac interferometer compact and stable. The generated two photons are with high brightness of $3\times10^4$ pairs/s/mW, which are highly entangled with fidelity of $0.985\pm0.002$. The entanglement is verified by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with $\mathcal S =2.756\pm0.007$.

            <p>Quantum resources exist in a hierarchy of multiple levels.

At order one, gates and channels are transformed by linear maps (superchannels) in order to simulate other gates. To develop a full hierarchy of quantum resources, beyond those first two orders, and to account for the fact that quantum protocols can interconvert resources of different orders, we need a theoretical framework that addresses all orders in a uniform manner. We introduce a framework based on a system of types, which label the different kinds of objects that are present at different orders. We equip the framework with a parallel product operation that modifies and generalizes the tensor product so as to be operationally meaningful for maps of distinct and arbitrary orders. Finally, we introduce a family of convex cones that generalize the notion of complete positivity to all orders, with the aim of characterizing the objects that are physically admissible, facilitating an operational treatment of quantum objects at any order.</p>

            <p>Entanglement witnessing is essential for quantum technologies such as computing, key distribution, and networking. Conventional bulk-optics methods require sequential reconfiguration across multiple polarization bases, limiting efficiency and scalability. We propose a metasurface-based analyzer that performs dual-basis (\sigma_z and \sigma_y) projections simultaneously by mapping them to orthogonal spatial modes. This allows direct access to the commuting two-photon correlators \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle and \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle required for entanglement witnessing. The metasurface design employs meta-atoms engineered to impart independent linear and circular phase delays through anisotropy and geometric control, resulting in polarization-dependent beam deflection that separates H/V and R/L components. This approach halves the measurement overhead compared to sequential analysis while offering a compact, integrable platform for chip-scale quantum photonics. The proposed scheme provides a path toward efficient entanglement verification with applications in quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and scalable quantum networks.</p>

Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors.

            <p>Bosonic codes, leveraging infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for redundancy, offer great potential for encoding quantum information. However, the realization of a practical continuous-variable bosonic code that can simultaneously correct both single-photon loss and dephasing errors remains elusive, primarily due to the absence of exactly orthogonal codewords and the lack of an experiment-friendly state preparation scheme. Here, we propose a code based on the superposition of squeezed Fock states with an error-correcting capability that scales as $\propto\exp(-7r)$, where $r$ is the squeezing level. The codewords remain orthogonal at all squeezing levels. The Pauli-X operator acts as a rotation in phase space is an error-transparent gate, preventing correctable errors from propagating outside the code space during logical operations. In particular, this code achieves high-precision error correction for both single-photon loss and dephasing, even at moderate squeezing levels. Building on this code, we develop quantum error correction schemes that exceed the break-even threshold, supported by analytical derivations of all necessary quantum gates. Our code offers a competitive alternative to previous encodings for quantum computation using continuous bosonic qubits.</p>

The detection is based on balanced homodyne detectors on the same photonic chip with a bandwidth of up to 12.5 GHz, which allows room-temperature operation.

            <h2>Efficient three-qubit gates with giant atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangze Chen, Anton Frisk Kockum</p>
            <p>Three-qubit gates are highly beneficial operations in quantum computing, enabling compact implementations of quantum algorithms and efficient generation of multipartite entangled states. However, realizing such gates with high fidelity remains challenging due to crosstalk, complex control requirements, and the overhead of parametric or tunable couplers. In this work, we propose and analyze the implementation of fast, high-fidelity three-qubit gates using giant atoms--artificial atoms coupled to a waveguide at multiple spatially separated points. By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term quantum computers and quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Optomechanical Entanglement and Mechanical Squeezing by the Synergistic Effect of Quadratic Optomechanical Coupling and Coherent Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Feng Jiao, Ruo-Chen Wang, Jing-Xue Liu, Hui-Lai Zhang, Ya-Chuan Liang, Yan Wang, Le-Man Kuang, Hui Jing</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement and squeezing associated with the motions of massive mechanical oscillators play an essential role in both fundamental science and emerging quantum technologies, yet realizing such macroscopic nonclassical states remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve strong optomechanical entanglement and mechanical squeezing in a membrane-embedded cavity optomechanical system incorporating a coherent feedback loop, where the membrane interacts with the cavity mode through both linear and quadratic optomechanical couplings. This hybrid optomechanical architecture offers a flexible tunability of intrinsic system parameters, thus allowing the membrane to be stiffened or softened through tuning the sign of quadratic optomechanical coupling and the cavity decay rate to be reduced via feedback control. Exploiting these unique features, we demonstrate that optomechanical entanglement can be substantially enhanced with positive coupling sign and suitable feedback parameters, while strong mechanical squeezing beyond the 3dB limit is simultaneously achieved over a broad parameter range with negative coupling sign, reaching squeezing degree above 10dB under optimized conditions. Our proposal, establishing an all-optical method for generating highly entangled or squeezed states in cavity optomechanical systems, opens up a new route to explore macroscopic quantum effects and to advance quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Subgradient Estimation for Conditional Value-at-Risk Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasilis Skarlatos, Nikos Konofaos</p>
            <p>Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a leading tail-risk measure in finance, central to both regulatory and portfolio optimization frameworks. Classical estimation of CVaR and its gradients relies on Monte Carlo simulation, incurring $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy. In this work, we design and analyze a quantum subgradient oracle for CVaR minimization based on amplitude estimation. Via a tripartite proposition, we show that CVaR subgradients can be estimated with $O(1/\epsilon)$ quantum queries, even when the Value-at-Risk (VaR) threshold itself must be estimated. We further quantify the propagation of estimation error from the VaR stage to CVaR gradients and derive convergence rates of stochastic projected subgradient descent using this oracle. Our analysis establishes a near-quadratic improvement in query complexity over classical Monte Carlo. Numerical experiments with simulated quantum circuits confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robustness to threshold estimation noise. This constitutes the first rigorous complexity analysis of quantum subgradient methods for tail-risk minimization.</p>

            <h2>Collusion-Resistant Quantum Secure Key Leasing Beyond Decryption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuyuki Kitagawa, Ryo Nishimaki, Nikhil Pappu</p>
            <p>Secure key leasing (SKL) enables the holder of a secret key for a cryptographic function to temporarily lease the key using quantum information. Later, the recipient can produce a deletion certificate, which proves that they no longer have access to the secret key. The security guarantee ensures that even a malicious recipient cannot continue to evaluate the function, after producing a valid deletion certificate. Most prior work considers an adversarial recipient that obtains a single leased key, which is insufficient for many applications. In the more realistic collusion-resistant setting, security must hold even when polynomially many keys are leased (and subsequently deleted). However, achieving collusion-resistant SKL from standard assumptions remains poorly understood, especially for functionalities beyond decryption. We improve upon this situation by introducing new pathways for constructing collusion-resistant SKL. Our main contributions are as follows: - A generalization of quantum-secure collusion-resistant traitor tracing called multi-level traitor tracing (MLTT), and a compiler that transforms an MLTT scheme for a primitive X into a collusion-resistant SKL scheme for primitive X. - The first bounded collusion-resistant SKL scheme for PRFs, assuming LWE. - A compiler that upgrades any single-key secure SKL scheme for digital signatures into one with unbounded collusion-resistance, assuming OWFs. - A compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant SKL schemes with classical certificates to ones having verification-query resilience, assuming OWFs.</p>

            <p>We extend the scheme of neutral atom Rydberg $C_Z$ gate based on double sequence of adiabatic pulses applied symmetrically to both atoms using counterdiabatic driving in the regime of Rydberg blockade. This provides substantial reducing of quantum gate operation times (at least five times) compared to previously proposed adiabatic schemes, which is important for high-fidelity entanglement due to finite Rydberg lifetimes. We analyzed schemes of adiabatic rapid passage with counterdiabatic driving for single-photon, two-photon and three-photon schemes of Rydberg excitation for rubidium and cesium atoms. We designed laser pulse profiles with fully analytical shapes and calculated the Bell fidelity taking into account atomic lifetimes and finite blockade strengths. We show that the upper limit of the Bell fidelity reaches ${\mathcal F}\simeq0.9999$ in a room-temperature environment.</p>

            <p>Noncommutativity of observables is a central feature of quantum physics. It plays a fundamental role in the formulation of the uncertainty principle for complementary variables and strongly affects the laws of thermodynamics for systems with noncommuting, that is, non-Abelian, conserved quantities. We here derive nonequilibrium generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics in the form of fluctuation relations, both for mechanically and thermally driven quantum systems. We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics. These findings demonstrate that noncommutativity maybe a useful thermodynamic resource.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joaquín López-Suárez, Michalis Skotiniotis</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of imaging two partially coherent sources and derive the ultimate quantum limits for estimating all relevant parameters, namely their separation, relative intensity, as well as their coherence factor. We show that the separation of the two sources can be super-resolved over the entire range of all other pertinent parameters (with the exception of fully coherent sources), with anti-correlated sources furnishing the largest possible gain in estimation precision, using a binary spatial mode demultiplexing measurement positioned at the center of intensity of the joint point spread function for the two sources. In the sub-Rayleigh limit, we show that both the relative intensity, as well as the real part of the coherence factor, can be optimally estimated by a simple boson counting measurement, making it possible to optimally estimate the separation, relative intensity and real coherence factor of the sources simultaneously. Within the same limit, we show that the imaging problem can be effectively reduced to one where all relevant parameters are encoded in the Bloch vector of a two-dimensional system. Using such a model we find that indirect estimation schemes, which attempt to extract estimates of the separation of the two sources by measuring the purity of the corresponding state of the two-level system, yield suboptimal estimation precision for all non-zero values of the coherence factor.</p>

            <h2>Information-thermodynamic bounds on precision in interacting quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Honma, Tan Van Vu</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost, indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuoran Bao, Daniel F. V. James</p>
            <p>A qubit, or quantum bit, is conventionally defined as "a physical system for storing information that is capable of existing in either of two quantum states or in a superposition of both". In this paper, we examine the simple question of whether two distinct levels, each consisting of multiply degenerate sub-states, could serve as a practical quantum bit. We explore this idea using a well-characterized atomic system of the kind employed in several quantum computing implementations. We approximate the atom as a two-level system without degeneracy lifting in the magnetic quantum number while using the angular momentum addition rules to select the desired state transition. We find that, in the continuous presence of the field, the atom still undergoes Rabi oscillations, which are suitable for quantum gate construction. In addition, we compute the average fidelity in quantum gate performance for a single degenerate atom and postulate the required form of two-atom interaction to construct a controlled Z gate.</p>

            <p>The commutative depth model allows gates that commute with each other to be performed in parallel. We show how to compute Clifford operations in constant commutative depth more efficiently than was previously known. Bravyi, Maslov, and Nam [Phys. Rev.

We show that the Prefix Sum problem can be computed in commutative depth 16 and size $O(n \log n)$, improving on the previous depth 18 and size $O(n^2)$ bounds. We also show that, for arbitrary Cliffords, the commutative depth bound can be reduced to 16. Finally, we show some lower bounds: that there exist Cliffords whose commutative depth is at least 4; and that there exist Cliffords for which any constant commutative depth circuit has size $\Omega(n^2)$.</p>

This transform, which maps basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier transform. Our algorithm is based on a method to exponentially fast forward the evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which significantly improves over prior art. We apply this Hermite transform to give examples of provable quantum query advantage in property testing and learning. In particular, we show how to efficiently test the property of being close to a low- degree in the Hermite basis when inputs are sampled from the Gaussian distribution, and how to solve a Gaussian analogue of the Goldreich-Levin learning task efficiently. We also comment on other potential uses of this transform to simulating time dynamics of quantum systems in the continuum.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop new pulse designs and embedding strategies to improve the analog quantum subroutines of hybrid column generation (CG) algorithms based on neutral-atoms quantum computers (NAQCs). These strategies are designed to improve the quality and diversity of the samples generated. We apply these to an important combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in logistics, namely the fleet assignment. Depending on the instance tested, our quantum protocol has a performance that is either comparable or worse than the best classical method tested, both in terms of the number of iterations and final objective value. We identify the cause of these suboptimal solutions as a result of our quantum protocol often generating high-quality but degenerate samples. We address this limitation by introducing a greedy post-processing technique, Make\_Diff, which applies bit-wise modifications to degenerate samples in order to return a non-degenerate set. With this modification, our quantum protocol becomes competitive with an exact solver for the subproblem, all the while being resilient to state preparation and measurements (SPAM) errors. We also compare our CG scheme with a Gurobi solver and find that it performs better on over 50\% of our synthetic instances and that, despite Gurobi having a more extensive runtime. These improvements and benchmarks herald the potential of deploying hybrid CG schemes on NISQ devices for industrially relevant CO problems.</p>

            <p>We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjan Cornelissen</p>
            <p>In this work, we generalize the recently-introduced graph composition framework to the non-boolean setting. A quantum algorithm in this framework is represented by a hypergraph, where each hyperedge is adjacent to multiple vertices. The input and output to the quantum algorithm is represented by a set of boundary vertices, and the hyperedges act like switches, connecting the input vertex to the output that the algorithm computes. Apart from generalizing the graph composition framework, our new proposed framework unifies the quantum divide and conquer framework, the decision-tree framework, and the unified quantum walk search framework. For the decision trees, we additionally construct a quantum algorithm from an improved weighting scheme in the non-boolean case. For quantum walk search, we show how our techniques naturally allow for amortization of the subroutines' costs. Previous work showed how one can speed up ``detection'' of marked vertices by amortizing the costs of the quantum walk. In this work, we extend these results to the setting of ``finding'' such marked vertices, albeit in some restricted settings. Along the way, we provide a novel analysis of irreducible, reversible Markov processes, by linear-algebraically connecting its effective resistance to the random walk operator. This significantly simplifies the algorithmic implementation of the quantum walk search algorithm, achieves an amortization speed-up for quantum walks over Johnson graphs, avoids the need for quantum fast-forwarding, and removes the log-factors from the query complexity statements.</p>

To address this, we present a generic approach to boost single-copy security to multi-copy security and apply this approach to many settings. As a consequence, we obtain the following new results: -One-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators, for any fixed polynomial t. -One-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys, for any fixed polynomial t. -Assuming indistinguishability obfuscation and other standard cryptographic assumptions, there exist identical-copy secure unclonable primitives such as public-key quantum money and quantum copy-protection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tenzan Araki, Joseph F. Goodwin, Zhenyu Cai</p>
            <p>Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates. Through classical post-processing, H-VEC virtually filters the error channel, projecting the noise into pure Y-type errors that are subsequently corrected using the classical code's native decoding algorithm. We demonstrate this by applying H-VEC to the classical repetition code. Under a code-capacity noise model, the resulting protocol not only provides full quantum protection but also achieves an exponentially stronger error suppression (in distance) than the original classical code, and even larger improvements over the surface code while using much fewer qubits, simpler checks and straight-forward decoding. H-VEC comes with a sampling overhead due to its post-processing nature. It represents a new hybrid quantum error correction and mitigation framework that redefines the trade-offs between physical hardware requirements and classical processing for error suppression.</p>

            <p>One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently sampleable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In that case, we can focus on efficient verification with efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verifications of classical/quantum distributions and classical/quantum cryptography, and show the following results: (i) Every quantumly samplable distribution is verifiable with a $\mathbf{P^{PP}}$ algorithm. (ii) If one-way functions exist, then no sufficiently random classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iii) If one-way functions do not exist, then every classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iv) If QEFID pairs exist, then there exists a quantumly samplable distribution which is not efficiently verifiable. (v) If one-way puzzles do not exist, then it is possible to verify sampling-based quantum advantage with a efficient quantum computer.</p>

We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling.

            <p>The quantum control of spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) holds promise for the targeted manipulation of magnetic field effects, with potential applications ranging from the design of noise-resilient quantum information processors to genetically encodable quantum sensors. However, achieving precise handles over the intricate interplay between coherent electron spin dynamics and incoherent relaxation processes in photoexcited radical-pair reactions requires tractable approaches for numerically obtaining controls for large, complex open quantum systems. Employing techniques relying on full Liouville-space propagators becomes computationally infeasible for large spin systems of realistic complexity. Here, we demonstrate how a control engineering approach based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) can offer a viable alternative by reporting on the successful application of PMP-optimal control to steer the coherent and incoherent spin dynamics of noisy radical pairs. This enables controls for prototypical radical-pair models that exhibit robustness in the face of relevant noise sources and paves the way to incoherent control of radical-pair spin dynamics.</p>

There exist various versions of boosting algorithms, which we improve upon through the introduction of QuantumBoost. Inspired by classical work by Barak, Hardt and Kale, our QuantumBoost algorithm achieves the best known runtime over other boosting methods through two innovations. First, it uses a quantum algorithm to compute approximate Bregman projections faster. Second, it combines this with a lazy projection strategy, a technique from convex optimization where projections are performed infrequently rather than every iteration. To our knowledge, QuantumBoost is the first algorithm, classical or quantum, to successfully adopt a lazy projection strategy in the context of boosting.</p>

            <p>Simulating time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians is a compelling application of quantum computers because it lies at the core of predicting the properties of materials and molecules. Fermions can be simulated on qubit-based quantum computers using a fermion-to-qubit mapping, subject to an overhead -- the circuit depth on a qubit quantum computer divided by that on a quantum computer built from native fermionic modes -- at worst scaling linearly with the number of modes $N$. Existing approaches that lower this depth overhead usually trade it for space, using $O(N)$ ancilla qubits. We exponentially reduce the worst-case overhead of ancilla-free fermion-to-qubit mappings to $O(\log^2 N)$ by constructing circuits that perform any fermionic permutation on qubits in the Jordan-Wigner encoding in depth $O(\log^2 N)$. We also show that our result generalizes to permutations in any product-preserving ternary tree fermionic encoding. When introducing $O(N)$ ancillas and mid-circuit measurement and feedforward, the overhead reduces to $O(\log N)$. Finally, we show that our scheme can be used to implement the fermionic fast Fourier transform, a key subroutine in chemistry simulation, with overhead $\Theta(\log N)$ without ancillas and $\Theta(1)$ with ancillas, improving exponentially over the best previously known ancilla-free algorithm with overhead scaling linearly with $N$. Our results show that simulating fermions with qubit quantum computers comes at a much lower asymptotic overhead than previously thought.</p>

Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic spin.</p>

            <h2>Coherent matter wave emission from an atomtronic transistor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sasanka Dowarah, Mengxin Du, Alan Zanders, Shengwang Du, Michael Kolodrubetz, Chuanwei Zhang</p>
            <p>The atomtronic matter-wave triple-well transistor is theoretically predicted to exhibit current gain and act as a coherent matter-wave emitter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an atomtronic transistor composed of a triple-well potential -- source, gate, and drain -- modeled by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We systematically explore the dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling.</p>

            <h2>Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenhaoyue Wang, Carlos J. Garcia-Cervera, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</p>

            <p>The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST) experiment uses superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors to search for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) with recoil spectroscopy of the $\mathbf{^7}$Be EC decay into $\mathbf{^7}$Li. A pulsed UV laser is used to calibrate the STJs throughout the experiment with $\sim$20 meV precision. Phase-III of the BeEST experiment revealed a systematic calibration discrepancy between STJs. We found these artifacts to be caused by resistive crosstalk and by intensity variations of the calibration laser. For phase-IV of the BeEST experiment, we have removed the crosstalk by designing the STJ array so that each pixel has its own ground wire. We now also use a more stable UV laser for calibration. The new STJ arrays were fabricated at STAR Cryoelectronics and tested at LLNL and FRIB. They have the same high energy resolution of $\sim$1\textendash2~eV in the energy range of interest below 100~eV as before, and they no longer exhibit the earlier calibration artifacts. We discuss the design changes and the STJ array performance for the next phase of the BeEST experiment.</p>

            <h2>High-spin magnetic ground states of neutral dopant clusters in semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rhine Samajdar, Haonan Zhou, R. N. Bhatt</p>
            <p>High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.</p>

            <p>A key challenge for quantum photonic technologies based on spin qubits is the creation of optically active defects in photonic resonators. Several of the most promising defects for quantum applications are hosted in diamond, and are commonly created through ion implantation and annealing at high temperatures and high vacuum. However, the impact of annealing on photonic resonator quality factor, a critical parameter governing their coupling to defects, has not been reported. In this work, we characterize the effect of annealing at temperatures >1200°C in high vacuum on the quality factors of diamond microdisk resonators. We investigate the optical losses associated with a non-diamond layer formed during annealing, and use Raman spectroscopy to analyze the resonator surface morphology and demonstrate that tri-acid cleaning can restore their optical quality factors. These results show the viability of creating defects in pre-fabricated diamond resonators without degrading their optical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amanda Gatto Lamas, Jacopo Gliozzi, Taylor L. Hughes</p>
            <p>We extend a recently defined measure of symmetry breaking, the entanglement asymmetry, to higher-form symmetries. In particular, we focus on Abelian topological order in two dimensions, which spontaneously breaks a 1-form symmetry. Using the toric code as a primary example, we compute the entanglement asymmetry and compare it to the topological entanglement entropy. We find that while the two quantities are not strictly equivalent, both are sub-leading corrections to the area law and can serve as order parameters for the topological phase. We generalize our results to non-chiral Abelian topological order and express the maximal entanglement asymmetry in terms of the quantum dimension. Finally, we discuss how the scaling of entanglement asymmetry correctly detects topological order in the deformed toric code, where 1-form symmetry breaking persists even in a trivial phase.</p>

            <p>Single nuclear spins in silicon are a promising resource for quantum technologies due to their long coherence times and excellent control fidelities. Qubits and qudits have been encoded on donor nuclei, with successful demonstrations of Bell states and quantum memories on the spin-1/2 $^{31}$P and cat-qubits on the spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nuclei. Isoelectronic nuclear spins coupled to gate-defined quantum dots, such as the naturally occurring $^{29}$Si isotope, possess no additional charge and allow for the coupled electron to be shuttled without destroying the nuclear spin coherence. Here, we demonstrate the coupling and readout of a spin-9/2 $^{73}$Ge nuclear spin to a gate-defined quantum dot in SiMOS. The $^{73}$Ge nucleus was implanted by isotope-selective ion-implantation. We observe the hyperfine interaction (HFI) to the coupled quantum dot electron and are able to tune it from 180 kHz to 350 kHz, through the voltages applied to the lateral gate electrodes. This work lays the foundation for future spin control experiments on the spin-9/2 qudit as well as more advanced experiments such as entanglement distribution between distant nuclear spins or repeated weak measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhilong Liu, Wentao Liu, Xiaofang Liu, Jieci Wang</p>
            <p>Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Cheng Liu, Lei-Hua Liu, Bichu Li, Hai-Qing Zhang, Peng-Zhang He</p>
            <p>Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daichi Imagawa, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We investigate the phenomenon of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin system, with particular attention to how it depends on the spatial profile and operator content of the applied perturbation, as well as its robustness against increase of amplitude and temporal discretization. Motivated by recent theoretical proposals linking such response patterns to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we numerically analyze the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit. In contrast, perturbations involving other spin components produce conventional propagating excitations without localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the response remains qualitatively robust when the time-dependent perturbation is approximated by a piecewise-linear function, highlighting the practical relevance of our findings for quantum simulation platforms with limited temporal resolution. Our results clarify the operator dependence of emergent bulk-like dynamics in critical spin chains and offer guidance for probing holographic physics in experimental settings.</p>

We present an alternate method of combining Haar random unitaries from the gluing lemma from [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] that is secure against adversaries with inverse query access to the joined unitary. As a consequence, we show for the first time that strong pseudorandom unitaries can generically have their length extended, and can be constructed using only $O(n^{1/c})$ bits of randomness, for any constant $c$, if any family of strong pseudorandom unitaries exists.</p>

            <p>Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.</p>

            <p>In the context of entanglement in relativistic $2\to 2$ scattering described by a perturbative $S$-matrix, we derive analytically the concurrence for a mixed final state of two qubits corresponding to a discrete quantum number of the scattered particles. Given an initial product state, the derived concurrence depends at the leading order on the real part of the inelastic forward amplitude and the initial state only. We also point out that the real part of the forward amplitude provides a subleading correction to the linearized entropy, reducing it by an amount that, for a computational-basis state, is equivalent to the relative entropy of coherence. We illustrate our findings with two examples of phenomenological interest: high-energy scattering of two scalar fields in the two-Higgs doublet model, and high-energy electron-positron annihilation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Chandra, Mahbub Rahaman, Soumyabroto Majumder, Analabha Roy, Sujit Sarkar</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</p>

            <p>Using the gauge-gravity duality, we study the electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in holographic plasma. The model we employ is the D(-1)-D3 brane system in which the D(-1)-branes correspond to the instantons in holography. To take into account the flavored quarks, the coincident probe D7-branes as flavors are embedded into the bulk geometry so that the effective electromagnetic Lagrangian with flavors corresponds to the action of the D7-branes according to gauge-gravity duality. We numerically evaluate the vacuum decay rate, the critical electric field and the V-A curve of the vacuum by using the D7-brane action with various values of the electromagnetic field. It implies the particles in the plasma acquire an effective mass in the presence of instantons as it is expected in the quantum field theory, and the plasma trends to become insulating when the electric field is small. This work reveals the relation between electromagnetic and instantonic properties of the vacuum in the plasma.</p>

We leverage the KLVY compiler to transform the non-local MSG into a 2-round interactive protocol, rigorously demonstrating that this compilation preserves the game-specific CDP. Previously, the quantum value and rigidity of the compiled game were investigated. We emphasize that we are the first to investigate CDP (local randomness in [Fu and Miller, Phys. Rev.

Then, we combine this CDP with the framework [Kitagawa, Morimae, and Yamakawa, Eurocrypt 2025] to construct Secure Key Leasing with classical Lessor (cSKL). SKL enables the Lessor to lease the secret key to the Lessee and verify that a quantum Lessee has indeed deleted the key. In this paper, we realize cSKL for PKE, PRF, and digital signature.

The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian.

More recent usage of the PPP Hamiltonian includes its application in high-throughput screening activities to the inverse design problem, which we illustrate here for two specific fields of technological interest: singlet fission and singlet-triplet inverted energy gap molecules.

            <p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p>

Here we derive new inequalities satisfied by the Schur-polynomials of such eigenvalues and, using eigenvalue estimation techniques from quantum information theory, prove their satisfaction up to degree $k$ implies the existence of approximate solutions with error $O(\ln k / k)$. Moreover, the existence of these tetrahedra is related to the semiclassical asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the unitary group $U(n)$, which are maps between multiplicity spaces that encode the associativity relation for tensor products of irreducible representations. Using our techniques, we prove the asymptotics of norms of these $6j$-symbols are either inverse-polynomial or exponential depending on whether there exists such tetrahedra of Hermitian matrices.</p>

            <h2>Variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Naumann, Jens Eisert, Philipp Schmoll</p>
            <p>We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is difficult to teach because it is microscopic and non classical. We present interactive electronic dice that simulate core quantum ideas through haptic interaction and visual feedback. Each die represents a six state system with a superposition display and basis dependent measurement. A pair of dice can be prepared in an entangled mode that yields anti correlated outcomes which sum to seven when measured in the same colour basis while remaining uncorrelated across different bases. The platform supports classroom demonstrations from basic superposition and measurement to simplified quantum key distribution with single die and entanglement based protocols. The design uses standard components, two custom PCBs, orientation sensing, cryptographic quality randomness, and low power wireless proximity detection. All hardware files and code are open source to enable adoption. Initial implementations with university and secondary school audiences suggest that the tangible and visual nature of the dice helps learners form intuitive models of superposition, measurement, and entanglement correlations.</p>

            <p>Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.</p>

The complexity of exactly describing the system-environment interaction with the HEOM method usually results in time-consuming calculations and a large memory cost.

HierarchicalEOM$.$jl features a collection of methods to compute bosonic and fermionic spectra, stationary states, and the full dynamics in the extended space of all auxiliary density operators (ADOs). The required handling of the ADOs multi-indexes is achieved through a user-friendly interface. We exemplify the functionalities of the package by analyzing a single impurity Anderson model, and an ultra-strongly coupled charge-cavity system interacting with bosonic and fermionic reservoirs.

            <p>In this paper we study the autoparallelity w.r.t. the e-connection for an information-geometric structure called the SLD structure, which consists of a Riemannian metric and mutually dual e- and m-connections, induced on the manifold of strictly positive density operators. Unlike the classical information geometry, the e-connection has non-vanishing torsion, which brings various mathematical difficulties. The notion of e-autoparallel submanifolds is regarded as a quantum version of exponential families in classical statistics, which is known to be characterized as statistical models having efficient estimators (unbiased estimators uniformly achieving the equality in the Cramer-Rao inequality). As quantum extensions of this classical result, we present two different forms of estimation-theoretical characterizations of the e-autoparallel submanifolds. We also give several results on the e-autoparallelity, some of which are valid for the autoparallelity w.r.t. an affine connection in a more general geometrical situation.</p>

            <p>Theoretically understanding and experimentally characterizing and modifying the underlying Hamiltonian of a quantum system is of utmost importance in achieving high-fidelity quantum gates for quantum computing. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical decoupling (DD) in characterizing and suppressing undesired two-qubit couplings as well as the underlying single-qubit decoherence, both significant hurdles to achieving precise quantum control and realizing quantum computing on many hardware prototypes. Through discrete search of dynamical decoupling sequences, we identify sequences that protect against decoherence and selectively target unwanted two-qubit interactions of general form. On a transmon-qubit-based superconducting quantum device, we identify separate white and 1/f noise components underlying the single-qubit decoherence and a static ZZ coupling between pairs of qubits. A family of syncopated dynamical decoupling sequences is found and their efficiency demonstrated in two-qubit benchmarking experiments. The syncopated decoupling technique significantly boosts performance in a realistic algorithmic quantum circuit.</p>

            <h2>Quantum State Preparation for Probability Distributions with Reflection Symmetry Using Matrix Product States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuichi Sano, Ikko Hamamura</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits for loading probability distributions into quantum states are essential subroutines in quantum algorithms used in physics, finance engineering, and machine learning. The ability to implement these with high accuracy in low-depth quantum circuits is a critical issue. We propose a novel quantum state preparation method for probability distribution with reflection symmetry using matrix product states. By considering reflection symmetry, our method reduces the entanglement of probability distributions and improves the accuracy of approximations by matrix product states. As a result, we improved the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix product states. Our approach, characterized by linear scalability with qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices. Also, our demonstration results reveal that the approximation accuracy in tensor networks depends heavily on the bond dimension, with minimal reliance on the number of qubits. Our method is demonstrated for a normal distribution encoded into 10 and 20 qubits on a real quantum processor.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, harnessing the power of qubits' superposition and entanglement for computational advantages over classical systems. However, scalability poses a primary challenge for these machines. By implementing a hybrid workflow between classical and quantum computing instances, D-Wave has succeeded in pushing this boundary to the realm of industrial use. Furthermore, they have recently opened up to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, expanding their applicability to many relevant problems in the field of optimisation. However, the extent of their suitability for diverse problem categories and their computational advantages remains unclear. This study conducts a comprehensive examination by applying a selection of diverse case studies to benchmark the performance of D-Wave's hybrid solver against that of industry-leading solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and IPOPT. The findings indicate that D-Wave's hybrid solver is currently most advantageous for integer quadratic objective functions and shows potential for quadratic constraints. To illustrate this, we applied it to a real-world energy problem, specifically the MILP unit commitment problem. While D-Wave can solve such problems, its performance has not yet matched that of its classical counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nilotpal Chakraborty, Roderich Moessner, Benoit Doucot</p>
            <p>A crucial ingredient for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is the construction of logical qubits with low error rates and intrinsic noise protection. We propose a cross-platform construction for such hardware-level noise-protection in which the qubits are protected from depolarizing (relaxation) and dephasing errors induced by local noise. These logical qubits arise from the entanglement between two internal degrees of freedom, hence - entanglemons. Our construction is based on the emergence of collective degrees of freedom from a generalized coherent state construction, similar in spirit to spin coherent states, of a set of such internally entangled units. These degrees of freedom, for a finite number of units, parametrize the quantized version of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}$P(3). The noise protection of the entanglemon qubit is then a consequence of a weakly coupled emergent degree of freedom arising due to the non-linear geometry of complex projective space. We present two simple models for entanglemons which are platform agnostic, provide varying levels of protection and in which the qubit basis states are the two lowest energy states with a higher energy gap to other states. We end by commenting on how entanglemons could be realized in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits and trapped ion platforms to possibly also quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene and quantum dots in semiconductors. The inherent noise protection in our models combined with the platform agnosticism highlights the potential of encoding information in additional weakly coupled emergent degrees of freedom arising in non-linear geometrical spaces and curved phase spaces, thereby proposing a different route to achieve scalable fault-tolerance.</p>

            <p>We construct a unitary oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QCMA}$ but quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) commitments and QCCC multiparty non-interactive key exchange exist. We also construct a unitary oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QMA}$, but quantum lightning (a stronger variant of quantum money) exists. This extends previous work by Kretschmer [Kretschmer, TQC22], which showed that there is a quantum oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{QMA}$ but pseudorandm unitaries exist. We also show that (poly-round) QCCC key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution can all be used to build one-way puzzles. One-way puzzles are a version of ``quantum samplable'' one-wayness and are an intermediate primitive between pseudorandom state generators and EFI pairs, the minimal quantum primitive. In particular, one-way puzzles cannot exist if $\mathbf{BQP}=\mathbf{PP}$. Our results together imply that aside from pseudorandom state generators, there is a large class of quantum cryptographic primitives which can exist even if $\mathbf{BQP} = \mathbf{QCMA}$, but are broken if $\mathbf{BQP} = \mathbf{PP}$. Furthermore, one-way puzzles are a minimal primitive for this class. We denote this class ``CountCrypt''.</p>

Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations through geometric rotations of surfaces in real space, opening a new approach to logical quantum computation. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups.

            <p>Aaronson, Atia, and Susskind (2020) established that efficiently mapping between quantum states $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\phi\rangle$ is computationally equivalent to distinguishing their superpositions $|\psi\rangle \pm |\phi\rangle$. We generalize this insight into a broader duality principle, wherein manipulating quantum states in one basis is equivalent to extracting their value in a complementary basis. This general duality principle states that the ability to implement a unitary representation of a group is computationally equivalent to the ability to perform a Fourier subspace extraction from its irreducible representations. Building on our duality principle, we present the following applications: * We extend the construction of publicly-key quantum money of Zhandry (2024) from Abelian group actions to a construction of quantum lightning from non-Abelian group actions, and eliminate Zhandry's reliance on a black-box model for justifying security. Instead, we prove a direct reduction to a computational assumption -- the pre-action security of cryptographic group actions. Our construction is realizable with symmetric group actions, including those implicit in the McEliece cryptosystem. * We provide an alternative quantum lightning construction from one-way homomorphisms, with security holding under certain conditions. This scheme shows equivalence among four security notions: quantum lightning security, worst-case and average-case cloning security, and security against preparing a canonical state. * We formalize the notion of quantum fire, states that are efficiently clonable, but not efficiently telegraphable. These states can be spread like fire, provided they are kept alive quantumly and do not decohere. The only previously known construction relied on a unitary quantum oracle, whereas we present the first candidate construction of quantum fire using a classical oracle.</p>

First, we give efficient symmetric circuits for key quantum techniques such as amplitude amplification, phase estimation and linear combination of unitaries. In addition, we show how the task of symmetric state preparation can be performed efficiently in several natural cases. Finally, we demonstrate an exponential separation in the symmetric setting for the problem XOR-SAT, which requires exponential-size symmetric classical circuits but can be solved by polynomial-size symmetric quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>The efficient optimization of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is critical for their successful application in quantum computing. The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method, which leverages the geometry of quantum state space, has demonstrated improved convergence compared to standard gradient descent [Quantum 4, 269 (2020)]. In this work, we introduce the Modified Conjugate Quantum Natural Gradient (CQNG), an optimization algorithm that integrates QNG with principles from the nonlinear conjugate-gradient method. Unlike QNG, which employs a fixed learning rate, CQNG dynamically adjusts its hyperparameters at each step, enhancing both efficiency and flexibility. Numerical simulations show that CQNG achieves faster convergence and reduces quantum-resource requirements compared to QNG across various optimization scenarios, even when strict conjugacy conditions are not fully satisfied--hence the term ``Modified Conjugate.'' These results highlight CQNG as a promising optimization technique for improving the performance of VQAs.</p>

            <p>The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error-correction codes, which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. It is therefore timely to explore error correction architectures consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. Upon such an architecture, we develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a reduced number of shuttling operations. We demonstrate how column-regular qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that is exactly equal to the column weight of the code when Shor-style syndrome extraction is used. We provide tables stating the number of required shuttles for many contemporary codes of interest. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for general codes, even when using Shor syndrome extraction. We also discuss how one could get around this by placing blanks in the ancilla array to achieve minimal shuttles with Shor syndrome extraction on any CSS code, at the cost of longer ancilla arrays</p>

            <p>Understanding the effects of noise on quantum computations is fundamental to the development of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. Simulation tools are essential for quantitatively modelling these effects, yet unless artificial restrictions are placed on the circuit or noise model, accurately modelling noisy quantum computations is an extremely challenging task due to unfavourable scaling of required computational resources. Tensor network methods offer a viable solution for simulating computations that generate limited entanglement or that have noise models which yield low gate fidelities. However, in the most interesting regime of entangling circuits (with high gate fidelities) relevant for error correction and mitigation tensor network simulations often achieve poor accuracy. In this work we develop and numerically test a method for significantly improving the accuracy of tensor network simulations of noisy quantum circuits in the low-noise (i.e. high gate-fidelity) regime. Our method comes with the advantages that it (i) allows for the simulation of quantum circuits under generic types of noise model, (ii) is especially tailored to the low-noise regime, and (iii) retains the benefits of tensor network scaling, enabling efficient simulations of large numbers of qubits. We build upon the observations that adding extra noise to a quantum circuit makes it easier to simulate with tensor networks, and that the results can later be reliably extrapolated back to the low-noise regime of interest. These observations form the basis for a novel emulation technique that we call non-zero noise extrapolation, in analogy to the quantum error mitigation technique of zero-noise extrapolation.</p>

            <p>We present EHands, a quantum-native protocol for implementing multivariable polynomial transformations on quantum processors. The protocol introduces four fundamental, reversible operators: multiplication, addition, negation, and parity flip, and employs the Expectation Value ENcoding (EVEN) scheme to represent real numbers as quantum states. Unlike discretization or binary encoding methods, EHands operates directly on vectorized real-valued inputs prepared in the initial state and applies a shallow quantum circuit that depends only on the polynomial coefficients. The result is obtained from the expectation value measured on a single qubit, enabling efficient parallel evaluation of a polynomial across multiple data points using a single circuit. We introduce both a reversible implementation for degree-$d$ polynomials, requiring $3d$ qubits, and a non-reversible variant that uses qubit resets to reduce the requirements to $d+1$ qubits. Both implementations exhibit linear depth scaling in $d$ and are explicitly decomposed into one- and two-qubit gates for direct execution on current quantum processing units. The protocol's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental validation on IBM's Heron-class quantum processors, showing reliable polynomial approximations of functions like ReLU and arctan.</p>

            <p>Retrieving classical information from quantum systems is central to quantum information processing. As a more general task than quantum state discrimination, which focuses on identifying the exact state, quantum state exclusion only requires ruling out options, revealing fundamental limits of information extraction from quantum systems. In this work, we study the conclusive exclusion of quantum states generated by group actions, establishing explicit criteria for when such exclusion is possible. For systems with complex symmetries, including finite and compact Lie groups, we derive a sufficient condition for conclusive exclusion based on the initial state's amplitudes and the group's structure. As applications to special groups such as Abelian groups, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for conclusive state exclusion and generalize the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph result to a wider range of scenarios. Finally, we explore zero-error communication via conclusive exclusion of quantum states and derive a lower bound on the feedback-assisted and non-signalling-assisted zero-error capacity of classical-quantum channels generated by group actions.</p>

            <p>Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.</p>

In analysis, infinite processes - such as Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences - construct real numbers as equivalence classes of rational approximations, bridging discrete rationals to the continuous real line. In quantum mechanics, infinite tensor products model nested measurements, where sectorization partitions the Hilbert space into equivalence classes, reconciling unitary evolution with wavefunction collapse. In statistical mechanics, macrostates emerge as equivalence classes of microstates sharing identical macroscopic properties, providing the statistical basis for thermodynamic irreversibility despite reversible dynamics. Equivalence relations formalize For-All-Practical-Purposes (FAPP) indistinguishability, reflecting operational limits on precision and observation. Together, these examples reveal a unified framework where infinity and equivalence underpin emergent macroscopic behavior from microscopic reversibility.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Max d-Cut via qudit swap operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Klep, Tea Štrekelj, Jurij Volčič</p>
            <p>Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem for systems of qubits is an example of a 2-local Hamiltonian problem, and a prominent paradigm in computational complexity theory. This paper investigates the algebraic structure of a higher-dimensional analog of the QMC problem for systems of qudits. The Quantum Max d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a graph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb C^d)^{\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is identified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and a single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored hierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC problem. For a large class of complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem are derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Lastly, the paper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest eigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph Hamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian distinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d, low-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling adaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest eigenvalue in each isotypic component.</p>

            <p>Out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) are crucial tools for studying quantum chaos as they show distinct scrambling behavior for chaotic Hamiltonians. We calculate OTOC and analyze the quantum information scrambling in atom-field and spin-spin interaction models, which are open-system models and exhibit non-Markovian behavior. We also examine the Loschmidt echo for these models and comment on their chaotic nature. The commutator growth of two local operators, which is upper bounded by the Lieb-Robinson bound, is studied for these models, and the patterns of scrambling are investigated.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Floquet states facilitating coherent subharmonic response of periodically driven many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steffen Seligmann, Hamed Koochaki Kelardeh, Martin Holthaus</p>
            <p>We demonstrate longtime coherent subharmonic motion of a many-boson system subjected to an external time-periodic driving force. The underlying mechanism is exemplified numerically through analysis of a periodically driven Bose-Hubbard dimer, and clarified conceptually by semiclassical requantization of invariant tubes pertaining to the system's mean-field description. In this way, one arrives at pre-Floquet states that relate to the actual many-body Floquet states in a manner similar to the relation of site-localized Wannier states to lattice-extended Bloch states in solid-state physics. It is argued that even high-order subharmonic response can be systematically engineered, and be observed experimentally, with weakly interacting Floquet condensates comprising a sufficiently large number of particles.</p>

            <p>Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.</p>

Our approach is to map an $N$-qubit symmetric state onto a bipartite symmetric state of higher local dimension. We show that this mapping preserves separability and allows to characterize the entanglement of the original multipartite state. In particular, we establish a connection between the border rank and the Schmidt rank, and derive lower bounds on entanglement measures.

            <h2>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Atom in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj</p>
            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the primary methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an emitter in a doubly resonant cavity. The system is modeled by the Lindblad Master Equation, and an approximate analytical solution is derived to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. Additionally, the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits are also identified. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency is approximately $35\%$, which is several times larger than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Mandel Q parameter, revealing highly bunched two-photon emission and super-Poissonian statistics. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and its spectrum consists of three prominent peaks corresponding to transitions between the dressed states of the system.</p>

            <h2>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Lunt, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Kenneth T-R McLaughlin, Curt von Keyserlingk</p>
            <p>The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.</p>

            <h2>Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Tang, Yimu Bao</p>
            <p>Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and perfect measurements and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</p>

Both the odd and even instanton sectors are summed to all orders. The double well is same-level asymmetric in the sense that the potentials at neighboring wells have the same bottom level but can have different Hessians/curvatures/frequencies, which modify Coleman's original formulas. This for instance implies that the reference model used to calculate the functional determinant of quantum fluctuations must now interpolate between simple harmonic oscillators of different frequencies. Examples of symmetric double and triple wells are worked out.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach to leverage Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. However, choosing optimal quantum circuits that efficiently solve a given VQA problem is a non-trivial task. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms enable automatic generation of quantum circuits tailored to the provided problem. Existing QAS approaches typically adapt classical neural architecture search techniques, training machine learning models to sample relevant circuits, but often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By reformulating QAS from a quantum perspective, we propose a sampling-free differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, which emerges from the search space of quantum circuits. The mixed state formulation also enables our method to incorporate generic noise models, for example the depolarizing channel, which cannot be modeled by state vector simulation. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization and Hamiltonian optimization tasks, namely the variational quantum eigensolver and the unweighted max-cut problems. We show our approach to be comparable to, if not outperform, existing QAS techniques while requiring significantly fewer quantum simulations during training, and also show improved robustness levels to noise.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermalization and average entropy of a subsystem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smitarani Mishra, Shaon Sahoo</p>
            <p>Page's seminal result on the average von Neumann (VN) entropy does not immediately apply to realistic many-body systems which are restricted to physically relevant smaller subspaces. We investigate here the VN entropy averaged over the pure states in the subspace $\mathcal{H}_E$ corresponding to a narrow energy shell centered at energy $E$. We find that the average entropy is $\overline{S}_{1} \simeq \ln d_1$, where $d_1$ represents first subsystem's effective number of states relevant to the energy scale $E$. If $d_E = \dim{(\mathcal{H}_E)}$ and $D$ ($D_1$) is the Hilbert space dimension of the full system (first subsystem), we estimate that $d_1 \simeq D_1^\gamma$, where $\gamma = \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$ for nonintegrable (chaotic) systems and $\gamma < \ln (d_E) / \ln (D)$ for integrable systems. This result can be reinterpreted as a volume-law of entropy, where the volume-law coefficient depends on the density-of-states for nonintegrable systems, and remains below the maximal possible value for integrable systems. We numerically analyze a spin model to substantiate our main results.</p>

Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent control of spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium disulfide ($\beta$-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear spin density. The observed spin defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their spin dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the spin coherence time (T$_2$) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate the structure and spin densities of two possible spin defect candidates.

            <p>We present an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating nonlinear dynamics described by a system of stochastic dissipative differential equations with a quadratic nonlinearity. The stochastic part of the system is modeled by a Gaussian noise in the equation of motion and in the initial conditions. Our algorithm can approximate the expected value of any correlation function that depends on $O(1)$ variables with rigorous bounds on the approximation error. The runtime scales polynomially with $\log{N}$, $t$, $J$, and $\lambda_1^{-1}$, where $N$ is the total number of variables, $t$ is the evolution time, $J$ is the nonlinearity strength, and $\lambda_1$ is the smallest dissipation rate. However, the runtime scales exponentially with a parameter quantifying inverse relative error in the initial conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous quantum algorithm capable of simulating strongly nonlinear systems with $J\gg \lambda_1$ at the cost poly-logarithmic in $N$ and polynomial in $t$. The considered simulation problem is shown to be BQP-complete, providing a strong evidence for a quantum advantage. We benchmark the quantum algorithm via numerical experiments by simulating a vortex flow in the 2D Navier Stokes equation.</p>

The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at this https URL, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.</p>

Third, we implement a propagate-and-prune solver in which every learned clause is certified by a dual Farkas certificate verified in exact arithmetic. This guarantees soundness while enabling sub-exponential pruning: if the induced network provides a per-variable pruning rate rho in (0,1) under epsilon-stable propagation, the search runs in time (2-rho)^n. These bounds do not contradict ETH or SETH: the worst case remains exponential, but structured families admit provable speedups. In cryptography, the results highlight how such reductions could affect hardness margins in idealized primitives; in foundations, they motivate laboratory tests of counterfactual bounds as potential probes of computational complexity. We explicitly distinguish experimental epsilon, which quantifies laboratory visibility, from numerical epsilon, which is a solver tolerance. This builds directly on our earlier framework for epsilon-instrumentation, here integrated into certified pruning with dual certificates.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer-Shannon Renyi Equivalence: Exact Results for Quantum Critical Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. A. Rajabpour</p>
            <p>Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.</p>

            <h2>Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aayush Vijayvargia, Ezra Day-Roberts, Onur Erten</p>
            <p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p>

            <h2>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Batin Tank</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreemayee Aditya, Alessandro Summer, Piotr Sierant, Xhek Turkeshi</p>
            <p>The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.</p>

We achieve trapping of $\approx1300$ atoms in periodic trap sites with a trap lifetime of $\approx15$ ms. We also observe the effect of varied lattice periods on the atomic motional frequencies.

            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyi Li, Yu Gan, Zeguan Wu, Xueyue Zhang, Zheshen Zhang, Junyu Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates (e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By applying König's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero $T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck, eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive tasks on emerging quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher information matrices from Rényi relative entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the Rényi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric Rényi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean Rényi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric Rényi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ Rényi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Han Li, Si-Han Shang, Shu-Min Wu</p>
            <p>In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</p>

            <h2>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet states in laser-dressed crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Tiwari, Roman Korol, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</p>

            <h2>QuIC: Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snehal Raj, Brian Coyle</p>
            <p>Scaling full finetuning of large foundation models strains GPU memory and training time. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue via adapter modules which update only a small subset of model parameters. In this work, we introduce Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters (QuIC Adapters), a PEFT approach inspired from Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits that can effectively finetune a model using less than 0.02\% memory footprint of the base model. QuIC adapters preserve pretrained representations by enforcing orthogonality in weight parameters, and have native deployment mechanisms on quantum computers. We test QuIC adapters by finetuning large language models like LLaMA and vision transformers on language, math, reasoning and vision benchmarks. In its first-order configuration, QuIC recovers the performance of existing orthogonal methods, while higher-order configurations enable substantial parameter compression (over 40x smaller than LoRA) for a modest performance trade-off, unlocking applications in highly resource-constrained environments. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant finetuning. Our findings suggest that QuIC adapters offers a promising direction for efficient finetuning of foundation models in resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <p>Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</p>

            <p>Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) are at the forefront of precision metrology, operating near a standard quantum limit (SQL) set by quantum noise. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit, yet there remain practical roadblocks concerning scalability and measurement resolution requirements. Here, we adapt the holonomic quantum-gate concept to develop a novel Rabi-type "global-phase spectroscopy" (GPS) that utilizes the detuning-sensitive global Aharanov-Anandan phase. With this approach, we are able to demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy in an OLC that achieves 2.4(7) dB metrological gain without subtracting the laser noise, and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the SQL. We further introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light-atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-canceling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily owing to the global nature of entangling interaction, and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits.</p>

            <p>Quantum-logic spectroscopy has become an increasingly important tool for the state detection and readout of trapped atomic and molecular ions which do not possess easily accessible closed-cycling optical transitions. In this approach, the internal state of the target ion is mapped onto a co-trapped auxiliary ion. This mapping is typically mediated by normal modes of motion of the two-ion Coulomb crystal in the trap. The present study investigates the role of spectator modes not directly involved in a measurement protocol relying on a state-dependent optical-dipole force. We identify a Debye-Waller-type effect that modifies the response of the two-ion string to the force. We show that cooling the spectator modes of the string allows for the detection of the rovibrational ground state of an N$_2^+$ molecular ion with a computed statistical fidelity exceeding 99.99%, improving on previous experiments by more than an order of magnitude while also halving the experimental time. This enhanced sensitivity enables the simultaneous identification of multiple rotational states with markedly weaker signals.</p>

            <p>Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</p>

When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent curved space gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. The lensing effect can appear in systems without (emergent) magnetic fields, such as those with coplanar spin textures. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauren E. Cook, Timothy J. H. Hele (University College London)</p>
            <p>Accurate and efficient simulation of nonadiabatic dynamics is highly desirable for understanding charge and energy transfer in complex systems. A key criterion for obtaining an accurate method is conservation of the Quantum Boltzmann Distribution (QBD). For a single surface, Matsubara dynamics is known to conserve the QBD, as a consequence of truncating the dynamics in the higher normal modes of the imaginary-time path integral. Recently, a nonadiabatic Matsubara (NA-Mats) dynamics has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 154, 124124) which truncates in the normal modes of the nuclear variables but not in the electronic variables, which are described with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) representation. Surprisingly, this NA-Mats method does not appear to conserve the QBD for a general system. This poses the question of the effect of truncating the higher path integral normal modes of the electronic variables in the MMST representation. In this article, we present what we believe is the first study of electronic normal modes of the MMST representation. We find that observables are not usually a function of a finite number of normal modes and that the higher normal modes are not constrained by the distribution, unlike in conventional nuclear normal modes. Furthermore, truncating the dynamics in MMST normal modes leads to inaccurate correlation functions and while the QBD appears conserved for an ensemble of trajectories, it is not for a single trajectory. Overall, this suggests that MMST path integral normal modes are not optimal for obtaining an accurate, QBD conserving nonadiabatic dynamics method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donovan L. Buterakos, Sandesh S. Kalantre, Joshua Ziegler, Jacob M Taylor, Justyna P. Zwolak</p>
            <p>Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, representative datasets designed to capture the full spectrum of data quality encountered in practice, with both high- and low-quality data for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features of the device state. Collating such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability, slow measurement bandwidths, and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to simulate charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With an extensive set of parameters that can be varied and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.</p>

            <p>We study methods for efficient preparation of approximate ground states of $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware. Working in a variant of the electric basis, we introduce a refinement of the irrep truncation based on the energy density of site singlets, which provides a finer gradation of simulation complexity. Using strong-coupling perturbation theory as a guide, we develop simple ansatz circuits for ground state preparation and test them via classical simulation on small lattices, including the $2\times 2$ plaquette lattice in $d=2$ and the cube in $d=3$. We contrast state fidelities and resource requirements of variational methods against adiabatic state preparation and introduce a method that hybridizes the two approaches. Finally, we report on the public release of \texttt{ymcirc} -- a package of tools for building $SU(3)$ circuits and processing measurements -- and \texttt{pyclebsch}, a package for efficiently computing $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.</p>

            <h2>Polarization dependence of spin-electric transitions in molecular exchange qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Troiani, Athanassios K. Boudalis</p>
            <p>Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles.</p>

            <h2>Simple Quantum Algorithm for Approximate $k$-Mismatch Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruhan Habib</p>
            <p>In the $k$-mismatch problem, given a pattern and a text of length $n$ and $m$ respectively, we have to find if the text has a sub-string with a Hamming distance of at most $k$ from the pattern. This has been studied in the classical setting since 1982 and recently in the quantum computational setting by Jin and Nogler and Kociumaka, Nogler, and Wellnitz. We provide a simple quantum algorithm that solves the problem in an approximate manner, given a parameter $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$. It returns an occurrence as a match only if it is a $\left(1+\epsilon\right)k$-mismatch. If it does not return any occurrence, then there is no $k$-mismatch. This algorithm has a time (size) complexity of $\tilde{O}\left( \epsilon^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{mn}{k}} \right)$.</p>

            <h2>Probability distributions over CSS codes: two-universality, QKD hashing, collision bounds, security</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pete Rigas</p>
            <p>We characterize novel probability distributions for CSS codes. Such classes of error correcting codes, originally introduced by Calderbank, Shor, and Steane, are of great significance in advancing the fidelity of Quantum computation, with implications for future near term applications. Within the context of Quantum key distribution, such codes, as examined by Ostrev in arXiv: 2109.06709 along with two-universal hashing protocols, have greatly simplified Quantum phases of computation for unconditional security. To further examine novel applications of two-universal hashing protocols, particularly through the structure of parity check matrices, we demonstrate how being able to efficiently compute functions of the parity check matrices relates to marginals of a suitably defined probability measure supported over random matrices. The security of the two-universal QKD hashing protocol will be shown to depend upon the computation of purified states of random matrices, which relates to probabilistic collision bounds between two hashing functions. Central to our approach are the introduction of novel real, simulator, and ideal, isometries, hence allowing for efficient computations of functions of the two parity check matrices. As a result of being able to perform such computations involving parity check matrices, the security of the two-universal hashing protocol is a factor of $2^{ \frac{5}{2} ( 5 - \frac{3}{2} ) + \mathrm{log}_2 \sqrt{C}}$ less secure, for some strictly positive constant $C$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Ju Lin, Hrant Gharibyan, Vincent P. Su</p>
            <p>We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of one hundred qubits or more, beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation, thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum device beyond fixed-point models.</p>

            <h2>Mitigating the barren plateau problem in linear optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew D. Horner</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a significant speedup of variational quantum algorithms that use discrete variable boson sampling when the parametrised phase shifters are constrained to have two distinct eigenvalues. This results in a cost landscape with less local minima and barren plateaus regardless of the problem, ansatz or circuit layout. This works without reliance on any classical pre-processing and allows for the fast gradient-free Rotosolve algorithm to be used. We propose three ways to achieve this by using either non-linear optics, measurement-induced non-linearities, or entangled resource states simulating fermionic statistics. The latter two require linear optics only, allowing for implementation with widely-available technology today. We show this outperforms the best-known boson sampling variational algorithm for all tests we conducted.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Govind Krishna, Jun Gao, Sam O Brien, Rohan Yadgirkar, Venkatesh Deenadayalan, Stefan Preble, Val Zwiller, Ali W. Elshaari</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption. Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes. Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 0.79 for single-photon states and 3.7 for NOON states, exceeding the shot-noise limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4. The experiment integrates quantum state generation, programmable photonic circuitry, and photon-number-resolving detection, establishing ancilla-assisted circuits as powerful tools for programmable quantum state engineering, filtering, multiplexed sensing, and nonunitary quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Quantum Entanglement Between Photon and Phonon Modes in a Coulomb-coupled Optomechanical Cavity Magnonic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhib Ullah, Muhammad Idrees, Said Mikki</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum information science and a crucial resource for quantum technologies such as precision sensing, secure communication, and computation. In hybrid cavity magno-optomechanical systems, entanglement among cavity photons, magnons, and phonons enables manipulation of quantum states across different modes via radiation pressure-based light-matter interaction. We propose a hybrid optomechanical cavity-magnonic setup with Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere allowing magnons to couple with photons via magnetic-dipole interaction. The system also uses optomechanical and electrostatic interactions to entangle cavity photons and mechanical resonators. We focus on how the magnon nonlinear Kerr effect and varying coupling strengths influence entanglement dynamics. By analysing nonlinear effects alongside other coupling parameters, we identify optimal conditions for initiating and sustaining robust entanglement between the motional modes (phonons) of two Coulomb-coupled mechanical resonators. Our model predicts that adding Coulomb interaction and magnon coupling enhances the degree and tunability of entanglement, making it more resilient to thermal baths at 3 K. This study addresses how to optimize and sustain phonon-phonon entanglement in complex hybrid quantum systems. These findings offer insights relevant to developing quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and other quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Any type of spectroscopy can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam P. Flew, Ivan Kassal</p>
            <p>Spectroscopy is the most important method for probing the structure of molecules. However, predicting molecular spectra on classical computers is computationally expensive, with the most accurate methods having a cost that grows exponentially with molecule size. Quantum computers have been shown to simulate simple types of optical spectroscopy efficiently -- with a cost polynomial in molecule size -- using methods such as time-dependent simulations of photoinduced wavepackets. Here, we show that any type of spectroscopy can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer using a time-domain approach, including spectroscopies of any order, any frequency range, and involving both electric and magnetic transitions. Our method works by computing any spectroscopic correlation function based on the corresponding double-sided Feynman diagram, the canonical description of spectroscopic interactions. The approach can be used to simulate spectroscopy of both closed and open molecular systems using both digital and analog quantum computers.</p>

We employ a detailed finite-size scaling analysis and a time-averaged Inverse Participation Ratio analysis to determine the critical properties of this second-order phase transition.

            <h2>Testing Quantum Mechanics with Quantum Computers: Qubit Information Capacity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Palmer</p>
            <p>Motivated by John Wheeler's assertion that the continuum nature of Hilbert Space conceals the information-theoretic nature of the quantum wavefunction, a specific discretisation of complex Hilbert Space is proposed, leading to the notion of qubit information capacity $N_{\mathrm{max}}$: for any $N \ge N_{\mathrm{max}}$-qubit state, there is insufficient information in the $N$ qubits to allocate even one bit to each of the $2^{N+1}-2$ degrees of freedom demanded by complex Hilbert Space and hence unitary quantum mechanics. Using gravitised quantum mechanics, it is estimated that, for typical qubits in a quantum computer, $N_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 500-1,000$. By contrast, $N_{\mathrm{max}}=\infty$ in quantum mechanics. On this basis, it is predicted that the exponential speed up of algorithms such as Shor's will have saturated in quantum computers which use more than about 1,000 logical qubits. This predicted breakdown of quantum mechanics should be testable within the coming decade. If verified, factoring 2048-RSA integers using quantum computers will for all practical purposes be impossible. The existence of a finite qubit information capacity has profound implications for reimagining the foundations of quantum physics (including the measurement problem, complementarity and nonlocality) and for developing novel theories which synthesise quantum and gravitational physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takaya Matsuura, Masahito Hayashi, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>We address the problem of constructing fully universal private channel coding protocols for classical-quantum (c-q) channels. Previous work constructed universal decoding strategies, but the encoder relied on random coding, which prevents fully universal code construction. In this work, we resolve this gap by identifying an explicit structural property of codebooks -- namely, the spectral expansion of an associated Schreier graph -- that guarantees universal channel resolvability. Our analysis reveals how this property can be related to channel resolvability through the theory of induced representation. Our main technical result shows that when the transition matrix of a graph associated with a codebook has a large spectral gap, the channel output induced by uniformly sampled codewords is asymptotically indistinguishable from the target output distribution, independently of the channel. This establishes the first deterministic, channel-independent construction of resolvability codebooks. Building on this, we construct a fully universal private channel coding protocol by combining it with universal c-q channel coding based on the Schur-Weyl duality. With appropriate modifications to the requirements on codebooks of universal c-q channel coding, we show that our fully universal private channel coding achieves the known optimal rate. This work thus sheds new light on the expander property of a graph in the context of secure communication.</p>

            <p>Quantum Annealing (QA) and QAOA are promising quantum optimisation algorithms used for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial problems on near-term NISQ systems. Many NP-hard problems can be reformulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO), which maps naturally onto quantum Hamiltonians. However, the limited qubit counts of current NISQ devices restrict practical deployment of such algorithms. In this study, we present the Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which leverages an iterative strategy to automatically divide the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) Hamiltonian into sub-Hamiltonians which can be optimised separately using Hamiltonian based optimisers such as QAOA, QA or Simulated Annealing (SA) and aggregated into a global solution. We compare HADOF with Simulated Annealing (SA) and the CPLEX exact solver, showing scalability to problem sizes far exceeding available qubits while maintaining competitive accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we realise HADOF for a toy problem on an IBM quantum computer, showing promise for practical applications of quantum optimisation.</p>

Space-time hybrid multiplexing of Q-Pairs achieves O(N) linear scaling in the number of required physical qubits, while preserving coherence and mitigating circuit-depth limitations through in-situ atom replacement. To demonstrate MAQCY's versatility, we implement a three-qubit quantum Fourier transform using only global operations and atom transport.

            <p>In this work, we consider a three-level ladder-type atom driven by a coherent field, inspired by the experimental work of Gasparinetti et al. [Phys. Rev. A 100, 033802 (2019)]. When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state $| f \rangle$ by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay $| f \rangle \rightarrow | e \rangle \rightarrow | g \rangle$. Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions amongst the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.</p>

Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian.

Although Rydberg antiblockade offers key opportunities in quantum information processing and sensing, its sensitivity to position disorder and parameter imperfections has posed a central roadblock. By adiabatically sweeping across the interaction-shifted resonance, our approach is unaffected by realistic levels of disorder and parameter variations. As a straightforward application case, we show that it naturally gives rise to avalanche excitation growth in both one- and two-dimensional arrays. This avalanche process yields high gain with exceptionally low background, making it promising for rare-event detection.

            <p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for fault-tolerant quantum computation, especially for electronic structure calculations of chemical systems. To accommodate the diverse characteristics of quantum chemical systems, numerous variants of QPE have been developed, each with distinct qubit and gate cost implications. In this paper, we quantify the impact of three key parameters on the overall quantum resource costs for the QPE algorithm: the choice between trotterization and qubitization, the use of molecular orbitals versus plane-wave basis-sets, and the selection of the fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme. From this, we establish clear performance trade-offs and delineate specific parameter regimes that minimize resource costs for relevant molecular systems. When performing phase estimation on large molecules in the fault-tolerant setting, we found the first-quantized qubitization circuit using the plane-wave basis to be the most efficient, with a gate cost scaling of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}([N^{4/3}M^{2/3}+N^{8/3}M^{1/3}]/\varepsilon)$ for a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals, which is the best known scaling to date. On the other hand, when only noisy intermediate-scale or near-term fault-tolerant systems are available, the phase estimation of small molecules can be performed with gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(M^{7}/\varepsilon^{2})$ via trotterization in the MO basis. Furthermore, we provide numerical estimations of qubit and T gate costs required to perform QPE for several real-world molecular systems under these different parameter choices.</p>

Here, we report the observation and theoretical modeling of nonlinear dynamics in a mechanical system driven at the single-excitation level. We achieve this using a cavity-optomechanical platform with large single-photon coupling rates and a nonlinear microwave resonator. Specifically, the large Kerr nonlinearity of our superconducting microwave circuit reduces the threshold for the observation of nonlinear dynamics by four orders of magnitude, making this regime experimentally accessible at the few-photon level. The parameter-based quantitative predicative power of the theoretical description underlines our deep understanding of the physics involved and that this device concept paves the way for experiments with non-classical microwave drive schemes.</p>

            <p>We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>The (PXP)$^2$ model: long-range quantum scars in optical cavities</h2>

            <p>Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and Néel-ordered phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase, distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick R. Banner, Steven L. Rolston, Joseph W. Britton</p>
            <p>We present BIFROST, a first-principles model of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers. Unlike conventional models, BIFROST employs physically motivated representations of the PMD properties of fibers, allowing users to computationally investigate real-world fibers in ways that are connected to physical parameters such as environmental temperature and external stresses. Our model, implemented in an open-source Python module, incorporates birefringence from core geometry, material properties, environmental stress, and fiber spinning. We validate our model by examining commercial fiber specifications, fiber-paddle measurements, and published PMD statistics for deployed fiber links, and we showcase BIFROST's predictive power by considering wavelength-division-multiplexed PMD compensation schemes for polarization-encoded quantum networks. BIFROST's physical grounding enables investigations into such questions as the sensitivity of fiber sensors, the evaluation of PMD mitigation strategies in quantum networks, and many more applications across fiber technologies.</p>

            <p>Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams for advanced quantum photonic applications.</p>

            <p>Phonons play a central role in fundamental solid-state phenomena, including superconductivity, Raman scattering, and symmetry-breaking phases. Harnessing phonons to control these effects and enable quantum technologies is therefore of great interest. However, most existing phonon control strategies rely on external driving fields or anharmonic interactions, limiting their applicability. Here, we realize multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling and theoretically show the modulation of phonon emission. This regime is realized by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to a nanoslot array functioning as a single-mode cavity. The small mode volume of the nanoslots enables high coupling strengths in the phonon-polariton system. We show theoretically that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective interaction between phonon modes, leading to superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium between distinct modes. Our findings are well described by a multimode Hopfield model. This work establishes a pathway for engineering phononic properties for light-harvesting and light-emitting technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniil Trefilov, Xoel Sixto, Víctor Zapatero, Anqi Huang, Marcos Curty, Vadim Makarov</p>
            <p>The decoy-state method is a prominent approach to enhance the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that operate with weak coherent laser sources. Due to the limited transmissivity of single photons in optical fiber, current experimental decoy-state QKD setups increase their secret key rate by raising the repetition rate of the transmitter. However, this usually leads to correlations between subsequent optical pulses. This phenomenon leaks information about the encoding settings, including the intensities of the generated signals, which invalidates a basic premise of decoy-state QKD. Here we characterize intensity correlations between the emitted optical pulses in two industrial prototypes of decoy-state BB84 QKD systems and show that they significantly reduce the asymptotic key rate. In contrast to what has been conjectured, we experimentally confirm that the impact of higher-order correlations on the intensity of the generated signals can be much higher than that of nearest-neighbour correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayin Gu, Fan Zhang</p>
            <p>The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. Our method offers significant improvements in numerical efficiencies both in memory cost and computation time, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity of our method. The superiority of our method is benchmarked with detailed performance tests.</p>

            <p>We investigate the phase transitions from chaotic to nonchaotic dynamics in a quantum spin chain with a local non-Hermitian disorder, which can be realized with a Rydberg atom array setting. As the disorder strength increases, the emergence of nonchaotic dynamics is qualitatively captured through the suppressed growth of Krylov complexity, and quantitatively identified through the reciprocity breaking of Krylov space. We further find that the localization in Krylov space generates another transition in the weak disorder regime, suggesting a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results closely align with conventional methods, such as the entanglement entropy and complex level spacing statistics, and pave the way to explore non-Hermitian phase transitions using Krylov complexity and associated metrics.</p>

Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Petrides, Arpit Arora, Prineha Narang</p>
            <p>The quantum sensing landscape has been revolutionized by advanced technologies like superconducting circuits and qubit-based systems which have furthered the ability to probe and understand fundamental properties of quantum matter. Here, we propose an integrated photonic device where a transmon qubit capacitively couples to a microwave cross-resonator, and the setup is employed for sensing of time reversal broken order in materials. In this sensing scheme, the transmon qubit plays a dual role as both a control element and a passive detector, while the photonic cross-resonator serves as the host for the sample, enabling a contact-free spectroscopic method suitable for studying materials where reliable electrical contacts are challenging to obtain, e.g., in van der Waal 2D heterostructures. We show that by tuning the coupling strength and phase between the transmon and the cross-resonator, the system allows selective control over the interaction dynamics and leads to a highly sensitive detection method that can be compactly understood in terms of evolution of excited state population and quantum metric of the resonator-transmon hybrid state. This architecture has the potential to host a wide range of quantum phenomena that can be precisely encoded in the dynamics of the transmon qubit and, in this way, potentially allows access to elusive aspects of correlated materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC) using a hybrid qubit-boson system described by the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian and its dispersive limit (DJC). These models provide high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, making them powerful substrates for temporal information processing. We systematically benchmark both reservoirs through linear and nonlinear memory tasks, demonstrating that they exhibit an unusual superior nonlinear over linear memory capacity. We further test their predictive performance on the Mackey-Glass time series, a widely used benchmark for chaotic dynamics and show comparable forecasting ability. We also investigate how memory and prediction accuracy vary with reservoir parameters, and show the role of higher-order bosonic observables and time multiplexing in enhancing expressivity, even in minimal spin-boson configurations. Our results establish JC- and DJC-based reservoirs as versatile platforms for time-series processing and as elementary units that overcome the setting of equivalent qubit pairs and offer pathways towards tunable, high-performance quantum machine learning architectures.</p>

            <p>Photons are a ubiquitous carrier of quantum information: they are fast, suffer minimal decoherence, and do not require huge cryogenic facilities. Nevertheless, their intrinsically weak photon-photon interactions remain a key obstacle to scalable quantum computing. This review surveys hybrid photonic quantum computing, which exploits multiple photonic degrees of freedom to combine the complementary strengths of discrete and bosonic encodings, thereby significantly mitigating the challenge of weak photon-photon interactions. We first outline the basic principles of discrete-variable, native continuous-variable, and bosonic-encoding paradigms. We then summarise recent theoretical advances and state-of-the-art experimental demonstrations with particular emphasis on the hybrid approach. Its unique advantages, such as efficient generation of resource states and nearly ballistic (active-feedforward-free) operations, are highlighted alongside remaining technical challenges. To facilitate a clear comparison, we explicitly present the error thresholds and resource overheads required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Our work offers a focused overview that clarifies how the hybrid approach enables scalable and compatible architectures for quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions and Noise Robustness of Quantum Graph States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Numajiri, Shion Yamashika, Tomonori Tanizawa, Ryosuke Yoshii, Yuki Takeuchi, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>Graph states are entangled states that are essential for quantum information processing, including measurement-based quantum computation. As experimental advances enable the realization of large-scale graph states, efficient fidelity estimation methods are crucial for assessing their robustness against noise. However, calculations of exact fidelity become intractable for large systems due to the exponential growth in the number of stabilizers. In this work, we show that the fidelity between any ideal graph state and its noisy counterpart under IID Pauli noise can be mapped to the partition function of a classical spin system, enabling efficient computation via statistical mechanical techniques, including transfer matrix methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Using this approach, we analyze the fidelity for regular graph states under depolarizing noise and uncover the emergence of phase transitions in fidelity between the pure-state regime and the noise-dominated regime governed by both the connectivity (degree) and spatial dimensionality of the graph state. Specifically, in 2D, phase transitions occur only when the degree satisfies $d\ge 6$, while in 3D they already appear at $d\ge 5$. However, for graph states with excessively high degree, such as fully connected graphs, the phase transition disappears, suggesting that extreme connectivity suppresses critical behavior. These findings reveal that robustness of graph states against noise is determined by their connectivity and spatial dimensionality. Graph states with lower degree and/or dimensionality, which exhibit a smooth crossover rather than a sharp transition, demonstrate greater robustness, while highly connected or higher-dimensional graph states are more fragile. Extreme connectivity, as the fully connected graph state possesses, restores robustness.</p>

            <p>In quantum information and computation, a central challenge is to determine which quantum states can be transformed into one another under restricted sets of free operations. While many transformations are impossible directly, catalytic processes can enable otherwise forbidden conversions: an auxiliary quantum state (the catalyst) facilitates the transformation while remaining unchanged. In this work, we introduce flexible catalysis, a generalization in which the catalyst is allowed to transform into a different auxiliary state, provided it remains a valid catalyst. We show that this framework subsumes both standard catalytic and multicopy transformations, and we analyze its advantages across several classes of free operations. In particular, we prove that when the free operations are local unitaries or permutation matrices, flexible catalysis enables state extractions that are unattainable with standard catalysis alone.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Partha Ghose</p>
            <p>The quantum measurement problem is often presented as a conflict between unitary evolution and non-unitary collapse. Drawing on Wittgenstein's later philosophy of language and Bohr's principle of complementarity, we argue that this conflict is a grammatical illusion arising from cross-context conflations. To address this, we introduce a contextual seven-valued logic modeled on the Jaina doctrine of \emph{saptabhangīnaya} (sevenfold predication). In one formulation, each proposition is assigned a triplet $(t,f,u)$ indicating its status as true, false, or unsayable within a given context, with paraconsistent rules blocking triviality. In another, contexts are explicitly formalized through quantified conditionals, aligning directly with Bohr's view that meaning derives from experimental arrangements. By comparing these two complementary approaches, we show how canonical paradoxes--including Schrödinger's cat and Wigner's friend--dissolve once context is made explicit. The result is a flexible logical framework that reconciles Wittgensteinian conceptual therapy, Bohr's complementarity, and the Jaina pluralistic tradition, offering a coherent semantics for quantum discourse.</p>

In this work, we develop a hybrid error suppression protocol that integrates Pauli twirling, probabilistic error cancellation, and the $[[n, n-2, 2]]$ quantum error detecting code. In addition, to reduce overhead from error mitigation components of our method, we modify Pauli twirling by lowering the number of Pauli operators in the twirling set, and apply probabilistic error cancellation at the end of the encoded circuit to remove undetectable errors. Finally, we demonstrate our protocol on a non-Clifford variational quantum eigensolver circuit that estimates the ground state energy of $\rm H_2$ using both \texttt{qiskit} AerSimulator and the IBM quantum processor \texttt{ibm\_brussels}.</p>

            <p>A general spin-resolved momentum distribution of electron-positron pairs produced in strong external fields is derived by combining the covariant spin projection operator and the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism. The result shows that the spin-resolved and helicity-resolved momentum distributions given in previous literature are actually two special cases of it. For any spin-direction unit vector, numerical investigations demonstrate that when the $z$-component of the unit vector vanishes, the number density of produced spin-up and spin-down particles is equal, while their momentum distributions have some asymmetry. For a nonzero $z$-component of the unit vector, there is a difference of $1-3$ orders of magnitude in the number density of spin-up and spin-down particles induced by angular momentum transfer in multiphoton absorption. Moreover, as the electric field strength increases and/or the field frequency decreases, the asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down particle number density decreases rapidly. These results offer an approach to study general spin states in vacuum pair production, and enhance our understanding of angular momentum transfer from fields to matter in extreme environments.</p>

            <p>The optimal chirped field for enhancing electron-positron (EP) pair production is explored using a quantum kinetic approach. First, the momentum spectrum and number density of EP pairs produced by Gaussian chirped fields are investigated. The results show that the momentum spectrum exhibits distinct interference patterns, while the number density grows monotonically with chirp parameters but oscillates with the carrier angular frequency. Moreover, the number density increases by four orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. The results are further compared with those from four other chirped fields: frequency-modulated, linear, quadratic, and sinusoidal chirp. The analysis reveals that the maximum number density for sinusoidally chirped fields is the highest, followed by Gaussian, frequency-modulated, quadratically, and linearly chirped fields. This ranking also applies to the maximum enhancement factors for these chirped fields. Notably, the number density for sinusoidally chirped fields improves nine orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. These results not only deepen our understanding of pair production in chirped fields but also provide significant optimization strategies for future vacuum pair production experiments.</p>

            <p>The intrinsic equivalence between electron spin and qubit offers a natural foundation for quantum simulations of magnetic materials. However, incorporating magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), a key feature of real magnets, remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a quantum simulation framework for MCA in CuSb2O6, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating ferromagnetic chains arising from frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions in a nearly square lattice. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ spin network is modeled as a four-qubit square lattice, with four paired ancilla qubits introduced to encode angle-dependent MCA. This two-qubit representation per spin site resolves the limitation that squared Pauli operators yield only the identity, enabling MCA terms to be faithfully embedded into quantum circuits. Using the variational quantum eigensolver, we determine an exceptionally small easy-axis MCA constant, just 0.00022% of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, yet sufficient to drive a spin-flop transition with $90^{\circ}$ spin reorientation and strong angular variation in magnetic torque. Beyond this regime, the simulations uncover a half-saturated magnetic phase at ultra-high fields, stabilized by anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of resource-efficient quantum simulations of complex magnetic phenomena in real materials.</p>

The study introduces novel visualization methodologies for quantum circuit analysis and provides actionable deployment recommendations for practical quantum machine learning implementations. Notably, systematic entanglement pattern analysis shows that circular connectivity provides superior balance between expressivity and trainability while maintaining computational efficiency.

Importantly, by converting detected errors into random resets, which are an intended part of the dissipative quantum dynamics being studied, we avoid any post-selection in our simulations, thereby eliminating the exponential cost typically associated with error detection.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishik Perugu, Bryce Kobrin, Michael O. Flynn, Thomas Scaffidi</p>
            <p>The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called $\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related concept of $\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and (ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$ (with $\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\alpha$ the growth rate), which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not saturate this bound, with $h = \lambda_L / 2\alpha <1$, the winding with Pauli size $\ell$ becomes $\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\ell^{1/h}$. We illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model.</p>

            <h2>Heisenberg Scaling in a Continuous-Wave Interferometer</h2>

            <p>Continuous-wave (CW) interferometry has stood at the frontier of precision measurement science since its inception, where it was used to search for the luminiferous ether, to the present day, where it forms the basis of interferometric gravitational-wave detection. Quantum theory predicts that this frontier can be expanded more rapidly by employing certain quantum resources, compared with the case of using only classical resources. In the quantum case, we can achieve ``Heisenberg scaling'', which manifests as a quadratic improvement over the best possible classical precision scaling. Although Heisenberg scaling has been demonstrated in pulsed operation, it has not been demonstrated for continuous operation. The challenge in doing so is two-fold: continuous measurements capable of Heisenberg scaling were previously unknown, and the requisite CW quantum states are fragile. Here we overcome these challenges and demonstrate the first CW interferometer exhibiting resource efficiency approaching Heisenberg scaling. Our scheme comprises a Mach-Zehnder interferometer illuminated with a pair of squeezed light sources, followed by a nonlinear estimator of the output homodyne record to estimate a differential phase modulation signal that drives the interferometer. We observe that this signal can be extracted with a precision that scales faster than what is allowed classically, and approaches the Heisenberg scaling limit.</p>

            <h2>Barnett Effect-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement in Magnomechanics with Optical Parametric Amplifier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noura Chabar, Shakir Ullah, Mohamed Amazioug</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement via the Barnett effect in a spinning ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Transformer-Based Neural Networks Backflow for Strongly Correlated Electronic Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Ma, Bowen Kan, Honghui Shang, Jinlong Yang</p>
            <p>Solving the electronic Schrödinger equation for strongly correlated systems remains one of the grand challenges in quantum chemistry. Here we demonstrate that Transformer architectures can be adapted to capture the complex grammar of electronic correlations through neural network backflow. In this approach, electronic configurations are processed as token sequences, where attention layers learn non-local orbital correlations and token-specific neural networks map these contextual representations into backflowed orbitals. Application to strongly correlated iron-sulfur clusters validates our approach: for $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{~S}_2\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([2Fe-2S]) (30e,20o), the ground-state energy within chemical accuracy of DMRG while predicting magnetic exchange coupling constants closer to experimental values than all compared methods including DMRG, CCSD(T), and recent neural network approaches. For $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_4 \mathrm{S}_4\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([4Fe-4S]) (54e,36o), we match DMRG energies and accurately reproduce detailed spin-spin correlation patterns between all Fe centers. The approach scales favorably to large active spaces inaccessible to exact methods, with distributed VMC optimization enabling stable convergence. These results establish Transformer-based backflow as a powerful variational ansatz for strongly correlated electronic structure, achieving superior magnetic property predictions while maintaining chemical accuracy in total energies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Zhan, Zixuan Wang, Richard P. Mirin, Kevin L. Silverman, Shuo Sun</p>
            <p>Resonance fluorescence from a single two-level system is a cornerstone of quantum optics. In the strong driving regime, its emission spectrum exhibits the iconic Mollow triplet, with each spectral component corresponding to a transition between distinct atom-photon dressed states. Here, we experimentally study the resonance fluorescence spectrum under a novel driving configuration in which a second gigahertz-frequency field drives the Rabi transition between two atom-photon dressed states. Our experiment is performed on a single semiconductor quantum dot strongly driven by a laser and a surface acoustic wave. We observe emission spectra that are significantly altered from the standard Mollow triplet, including the dynamical cancellation of resonance fluorescence at the central emission frequency. These spectra are explained by a theoretical model that incorporates the hybridization of the two-level system, the optical field, and the acoustic field. Motivated by this model, we experimentally validate the condition for optimal cooling of acoustic phonons in an emitter-optomechanical system. Our results offer new insights into the quantum interactions among single two-level systems, optical fields, and acoustic fields in the strong driving limit, with important applications in nonclassical acoustic state generation, quantum transduction, and quantum sensing of thermal motions.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition induced by magnon Kerr effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Qiang Zhang, Si-Yan Lin, Wei Feng, Yi-Hao Kang, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Recently, proposals for realizing a nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition (SQPT) have been put forward, based on either nonreciprocal interactions between two spin ensembles or the Sagnac-Fizeau shift in a spinning cavity. However, experimental implementation of such a nonreciprocal SQPT remains challenging. This motivates the search for new mechanisms capable of producing a nonreciprocal SQPT. Here, we propose an alternative approach to realize a nonreciprocal SQPT, induced by the magnon Kerr effect (MKE), in a cavity magnonic system, where magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are coupled to cavity photons. The Kerr coefficient $K$ is positive (negative), i.e., $K>0$ ($K<0$), when the bias magnetic field is aligned along the crystallographic axis [100] ([110]) of the YIG sphere. We show that the steady-state phase diagrams differ significantly for both cases with $K > 0$ and $K < 0$, which is the origin of the nonreciprocal SQPT. By further studying the steady-state magnon occupation and its fluctuations versus the parametric drive strength, we demonstrate that the SQPT becomes nonreciprocal, characterized by distinct critical thresholds for $K > 0$ and $K < 0$. Moreover, we introduce a bidirectional contrast ratio to quantify this nonreciprocal behavior. Our work provides a new mechanism for realizing the nonreciprocal SQPT, with potential applications in designing nonreciprocal quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The ability to extend the lifetime of a logical qubit beyond that of the best physical qubit available within the same system, i.e., the break-even point, is a prerequisite for building practical quantum computers. So far, this point has been exceeded through active quantum error correction (QEC) protocols, where a logical error is corrected by measuring its syndrome and then performing an adaptive correcting operation. Autonomous QEC (AQEC), without the need for such resource-consuming measurement-feedback control, has been demonstrated in several experiments, but none of which has unambiguously reached the break-even point. Here, we present an unambiguous demonstration of beyond-break-even AQEC in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where a photonic logical qubit encoded in a superconducting microwave cavity is protected against photon loss through autonomous error correction, enabled by engineered dissipation. Under the AQEC protection, the logical qubit achieves a lifetime surpassing that of the best physical qubit available in the system by 18\%. We further employ this AQEC protocol to enhance the precision for measuring a slight frequency shift, achieving a metrological gain of 6.3 dB over that using the most robust Fock-state superposition. These results illustrate that the demonstrated AQEC procedure not only represents a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computation but also offers advantages for building robust quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>In its beginnings, the physics of intense laser-matter interactions was the physics of multiphoton processes. The theory was reduced then to high-order perturbation theory, while treating matter and light in a quantum manner. With the advent of chirped pulse amplification developed by D. Strickland and G. Mourou, which enabled generation of ultra-intense, ultra-short, coherent laser pulses, the need for a quantum electrodynamics description of electromagnetic (EM) fields practically ceased to exist and lost relevance. Contemporary attoscience (AS), and more generally ultrafast laser physics, awarded the Nobel Prize in 2023 to P. Agostini, F. Krausz, and A. L'Huillier, commonly uses the classical description of EM fields while keeping a fully quantum description of matter. The progress and successes of AS in the last 40 years have been spectacular, with an enormous amount of fascinating investigations in basic research and technology. Yet a central question remains: can ultrafast laser physics continue to advance without reintroducing quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics into its description of light-matter interactions?

            <p>A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state, and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João Pedro Mendonça, Krzysztof Jachymski, Yao Wang</p>
            <p>The superradiant phenomenon, usually described by the Dicke model, is a hallmark of strong light-matter interaction. We explore how matter-matter interactions influence this phenomenon by performing ground-state simulations of Dicke-like models with both isotropic and anisotropic spin couplings. We find that Ising-type interactions produce two qualitatively distinct phase boundaries, one of which gives rise to an antiferromagnetic-normal phase connected to the superradiant regime via a first-order phase transition. Under anisotropic couplings, we uncover a strongly correlated phase where in-plane spin order coexists with superradiance, exhibiting sublinear scaling of the photon occupation per site and power-law decay of spin correlations. Furthermore, superradiance can be strengthened by tuning either isotropic or anisotropic interactions, highlighting the role of intrinsic many-body correlations in shaping light-matter quantum phases.</p>

            <p>No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</p>

            <p>The intersection of quantum computing and quantum chemistry represents a promising frontier for achieving quantum utility in domains of both scientific and societal relevance. Owing to the exponential growth of classical resource requirements for simulating quantum systems, quantum chemistry has long been recognized as a natural candidate for quantum computation. This perspective focuses on identifying scientifically meaningful use cases where early fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are considered to be equipped with approximately 25--100 logical qubits, could deliver tangible impact. While recent advances in classical computing have pushed the boundaries of tractable simulations to unprecedented scales, this logical-qubit regime represents the first window where quantum devices can pursue qualitatively distinct strategies, such as polynomial-scaling phase estimation, direct simulation of quantum dynamics, and active-space embedding, that remain challenging for classical solvers, for instance, multireference charge-transfer and conical-intersection states central to photochemistry and materials design. We highlight near-term opportunities in algorithm and software design, discuss representative chemical problems suited for quantum acceleration, and propose strategic roadmaps and collaborative pathways for advancing practical quantum utility in quantum chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Simultaneous Quantization and Reduction of Constrained Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianhao M. Yang</p>
            <p>We present a novel framework for quantizing constrained quantum systems in which the processes of quantization and constraint enforcement are performed simultaneously. The approach is based on an extension of the stationary action principle, incorporating an information-theoretic term arising from vacuum fluctuations. Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange multipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum dynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction. We demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system with vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the time-independent Schrödinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac quantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global translational invariance, where all three methods agree. These results show that the proposed framework generalizes standard quantization schemes and provides a consistent treatment of systems with constraints that cannot be expressed as linear operators acting on the wave function. In addition to a unified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism also offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising from vacuum fluctuations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Abu-Nada, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>We present a \emph{novel} and scalable supervised machine learning framework to predict open-quantum system dynamics and detect non-Markovian memory using only local ancilla measurements. A system qubit is coherently coupled to an ancilla via a symmetric XY Hamiltonian; the ancilla interacts with a noisy environment and is the only qubit we measure. A feedforward neural network, trained on short sliding windows of supplementary data from the past, forecasts the observable system $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ without state tomography or knowledge of the bath. To quantify memory, we introduce a normalized revival-based metric that counts upward 'turn-backs' in \emph{predicted} $\langle Z_{(S)}(t)\rangle$ and reports the fraction of evaluated samples that exceeds a small threshold. This bounded score provides an interpretable, model-independent indicator of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate the method on two representative noise channels, non-unital amplitude damping and unital dephasing from random telegraph noise (RTN). Under matched conditions, the model accurately reproduces the dynamics and flags memory effects, with RTN exhibiting a larger normalized revival score than amplitude damping. Overall, the approach is experimentally realistic and readily extensible, enabling real-time, interpretable non-Markovian diagnostics from accessible local measurements.</p>

            <h2>Cost-aware Photonic Graph State Generation: A Graphical Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sobhan Ghanbari, Hoi-Kwong Lo</p>
            <p>Photonic graph states are essential resources for quantum computation and communication. Deterministic emitter-based generation of graph states overcomes the scalability issues of probabilistic approaches, but their experimental realization is constrained by technological demands, often expressed by the number of two-qubit gates and the depth and/or width of the quantum circuits used to model the generation process. We introduce a cost-aware framework for the generation of photonic graph states of arbitrary size and shape, built on a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions and a universal set of elementary graph operations that govern the evolution of the state toward the target. Within this framework, we develop Graph Builder, a deterministic generation algorithm that achieves substantial reductions (up to an order of magnitude) in two-qubit gate usage for both random and structured graphs, compared with alternative approaches. The algorithm uses the minimum number of emitters possible for a fixed emission sequence, while also supporting the use of extra emitters for controlled trade-offs between emitter count and other cost metrics. Moreover, by systematically identifying the degrees of freedom at each stage of the generation process, this framework fully characterizes the optimization landscape, enabling analytic, heuristic, or exhaustive strategies for further cost reductions. Our approach provides a general and versatile tool for designing and optimizing emitter-based photonic graph state generation protocols, essential for scalable and resource-efficient photonic quantum information processing.</p>

By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</p>

            <p>Hereby, we study the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons at telecom C-band by biexciton-exciton cascade from non-resonantly excited epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and shortening the radiative lifetimes.</p>

            <p>Due to its fast and robust characteristics, nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation with various optimized techniques has received much attention. However, these strategies either require precise pulse control or can only mitigate partial systematic errors, hindering their experimental development. Here, we propose a scheme for optimized composite nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (OCNGQGs), which can further enhance the gate performance of the composite nonadiabatic geometric scheme. Specifically, by optimizing the path parameter, our scheme effectively resists systematic errors in both directions, i.e., Rabi frequency and detuning errors, while preserving the flexibility of pulse shapes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our scheme offers superior gate robustness against these two types of errors compared to conventional schemes. Additionally, we propose to implement our scheme on superconducting transmon qubits, where the numerical results show the robustness of universal gates remaining evident within current technology. Therefore, our proposal provides a promising approach to achieve robust quantum gates for future scalable quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Decoding Problem : Tight Achievability Bounds and Application to Regev's Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agathe Blanvillain, André Chailloux, Jean-Pierre Tillich</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum decoding problem. It consists in recovering a codeword given a superposition of noisy versions of this codeword. By measuring the superposition, we get back to the classical decoding problem. It appears for the first time in Chen, Liu and Zhandry's work showing a quantum advantage for the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem for the $l_\infty$ norm. In a recent paper, Chailloux and Tillich proved that when we have a noise following a Bernoulli distribution, the quantum decoding problem can be solved in polynomial time and is therefore easier than classical decoding for which the best known algorithms have an exponential complexity. They also give an information theoretic limit for the code rate at which this problem can be solved which turns out to be above the Shannon limit. In this paper, we generalize the last result to all memoryless noise models. We also show similar results in the rank metric case which corresponds to a noise model which is not memoryless. We analyze the Pretty Good Measurement, from which we derive an information theoretic limit for this problem. By using the algorithm for the quantum decoding problem together with Regev's reduction, we derive a quantum algorithm sampling codewords from the dual code according to a probability distribution which is the dual of the original noise. It turns out that at the information theoretic limit, we get the most likely nonzero codeword of the dual code. When the distribution is a decreasing function of the weight, we find minimal nonzero codewords. Note that Regev's reduction used together with classical decoding is much less satisfying since it is not able to output those minimum weight codewords.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Size Security Bounds in Semi-Quantum Key Distribution: Spectral, Operator-Theoretic, and Entropic Perspectives</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahidur Rezwan Ratul</p>
            <p>We study Semi-Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD) with a focus on finite-size security bounds, developed through three complementary perspectives. (i) Spectral disturbance: wrong-basis Lüders updates produce closed-form spectra and purity loss, which serve as basis-independent indicators of disturbance. (ii) Operator-theoretic reduction: in Z/Z-sifted rounds, intercept-resend attacks can be represented as an effective depolarizing channel, characterized by a fidelity-QBER relation. (iii) Entropic trade-offs: Maassen-Uffink and memory-assisted uncertainty relations certify security through X tests and reflection rounds, even when the sifted QBER is low. The exposition provides step-by-step derivations supported by physically interpretable figures, and the framework concludes with finite-size estimates based on concentration inequalities that are suited for practical parameter estimation.</p>

We focus on one of the leading sources of quantum FOG phase uncertainty, uncorrelated photon saturation. We characterize the optimal ranges of phase bias angles which minimize this uncertainty to allow for sub-shot noise precision. As an example, we apply the present-day leading quantum FOG experiment as part of our analysis. This opens up a path to sub-shot noise angular rotation sensitivity further beyond the earth's rotation rate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iason A. Sofos, Andrew Hallam, Jiannis K. Pachos</p>
            <p>We investigate the apparent thermality of Hawking radiation in the semi-classical limit of quantum black holes using the mean-field limit of a chiral spin-chain simulator, which models fermions propagating on a black hole space-time in the continuum. In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.</p>

            <p>We study the conditions required to distinguish laser-induced nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in vacuum from competing signals due to interactions of laser pulses with ionized residual gas. The latter is inevitably present in vacuum chambers where experiments are performed because the vacuum is never perfect and there is always some residual pressure. The rarefied gas contribution is modeled statistically using the 1D-1V Vlasov-Maxwell system, while vacuum nonlinearities are described within the weak-field expansion of the Heisenberg-Euler effective action. In both cases, photon spectra from wave-mixing processes are evaluated by solving numerically the resulting partial differential equations using a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We consider short pulses in co- and counter-propagating configurations, allowing us to identify the laser intensities and vacuum pressures for which the vacuum signal dominates. These results provide quantitative guidance for future all-optical experiments aiming to detect light-by-light scattering in vacuum.</p>

            <p>We study a generalization of `Yukawa models' in which Majorana fermions, interacting via all-to-all random couplings as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, are parametrically coupled to disordered bosonic degrees of freedom described by a quantum $p-$spin model. The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.</p>

            <p>We investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of amassless electron in graphene in a two-dimensional noncommutative (NC) plane under a constant background magnetic field. To address the issue of gauge invariance, we employ an effective massless NC Dirac field theory, incorporating the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map alongside the Moyal star product. Using this framework, we derive a manifestly gauge-invariant Hamiltonian for a massless Dirac particle, which serves as the basis for studying the relativistic Landau problem in graphene in NC space. Specifically, we analyze the motion of a relativistic electron in monolayer graphene within this background field and compute the energy spectrum of the NC Landau system. The NC-modified energy levels are then used to explore the system's thermodynamic response. Notably, in the low-temperature limit, spatial noncommutativity leads to a spontaneous magnetization-a distinct signature of NC geometry in relativistic condensed matter systems like graphene.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we examine the holographic complexity of a theory of Einstein-Maxwell with a non-minimal coupling $R^2 F_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu} $ term via complexity=anything. We introduce a perturbative black brane solution in AdS spacetime up to the first order of the non-minimal coupling. Because the model exhibits the resistivity proportional to the temperature, it could describe strange metals. The complexity of the solution could be characterized by three quantities: the conserved charge, the non-minimal coupling and the generalized term in the complexity. The generalized term is chosen to be $C^2$, the Weyl squared tensor, $R^2F^2$ and $F^2$. The physical interpretation of the three quantities has been provided where the generalized term is interpreted as a bulk penalty factor, the non-minimal coupling and the conserved charge as an effective scrambling time of the dual theory which contains the choice of the generalization parameter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wirawat Kokaew, Thiparat Chotibut, Areeya Chantasri</p>
            <p>Finding controls for open quantum systems needs to take into account effects from unwanted environmental noise. Since actual realizations or states of the noise are typically unknown, the usual treatment for the quantum system's decoherence dynamics is via the so-called Lindblad master equation, which in essence describes an average evolution (mean path) of the system's state affected by the unknown noise. We here consider an alternative view of a noise-affected open quantum system, where the average dynamics can be unravelled into hypothetical noisy quantum trajectories, and propose a control strategy for the state-preparation problem based on the likelihood of noise occurrence. We formulate a stochastic path integral for noise variables whose extremum yields control functions associated with a most-likely noise to achieve target states. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to a qubit-state preparation under dephasing noise and analytically solve for controlled Rabi drives for arbitrary target states. Since the method is constructed based on the probability of noise, we also introduce a fidelity success rate as a measure of the state preparation. We benchmark against the mean-path approaches, e.g., GRAPE and CRAB controls, using both average fidelity and a success-rate metric. While standard mean-path controls maximize average fidelity, most-likely controls achieve higher success rates, especially at strong dephasing.</p>

            <p>This work presents a new approach for simulating the HHL linear systems of equations solver algorithm with tensor networks. First, a novel HHL in the qudits formalism, the generalization of qubits, is developed, and then its operations are transformed into an equivalent classical HHL, taking advantage of the non-unitary operations that they can apply. The main novelty of this proposal is to perform a classical simulation of the HHL as efficiently as possible to benchmark the algorithm steps according to its input parameters and the input matrix. The algorithm is applied to three classical simple simulation problems, comparing it with an exact inversion algorithm, and its performance is compared against an implementation of the original HHL simulated in the Qiskit framework, providing both codes. It is also applied to study the sensitivity of the HHL algorithm with respect to its hyperparameter values, reporting the existence of saturation points and maximal performance values. The results show that this approach can achieve a promising performance in computational efficiency to simulate the HHL process without quantum noise, providing a higher bound for its performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José A. Almanza-Marrero, Gonzalo Manzano</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii</p>
            <p>The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</p>

            <p>Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. Wave matrix Lindbladization (WML) similarly processes multiple copies of a program state $\psi_L$ in order to realize a Lindbladian evolution. Both algorithms are prototypical sample-based quantum algorithms and can be used for various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum principal component analysis, Hamiltonian simulation, and Lindbladian simulation. In this work, we present detailed sample complexity analyses for DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, as well as for WML and sample-based Lindbladian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$ for evolution time $t$ and imprecision level $\varepsilon$ quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor. Additionally, we prove that the sample complexity of WML is no larger than $3t^2d^2/\varepsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space on which the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially, and we prove a lower bound of $10^{-4} t^2/\varepsilon$ on the sample complexity of sample-based Lindbladian simulation. These results prove that WML is optimal for sample-based Lindbladian simulation whenever the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially on a constant-sized system. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] and the WML sample complexity analysis in [Patel and Wilde, Open Systems \& Information Dynamics 30, 2350010 (2023)] appear to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here.</p>

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p>Developing a dark matter detector with wide mass tunability is an immensely desirable property, yet it is challenging due to maintaining strong sensitivity. Resonant cavities for dark matter detection have traditionally employed mechanical tuning, moving parts around to change electromagnetic boundary conditions. However, these cavities have proven challenging to operate in sub-Kelvin cryogenic environments due to differential thermal contraction, low heat capacities, and low thermal conductivities. Instead, we develop an electronically tunable cavity architecture by coupling a superconducting 3D microwave cavity with a DC flux tunable SQUID. With a flux delivery system engineered to maintain high coherence in the cavity, we perform a hidden-photon dark matter search below the quantum-limited threshold. A microwave photon counting technique is employed through repeated quantum non-demolition measurements using a transmon qubit. With this device, we perform a hidden-photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to ${\varepsilon}< 8.2\times 10^{-15}$ in a tunable band from 5.672 GHz to 5.694 GHz. By coupling multimode tunable cavities to the transmon, wider hidden-photon searching ranges are possible.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Speed Limit and Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation under Feedback Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayato Yunoki, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Fundamental trade-off relations, such as quantum speed limit and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, describe the performance limits of quantum systems by imposing that improvements in speed or precision necessitate a substantial thermodynamic cost. Quantum feedback control, which is a pivotal technique for manipulating quantum dynamics based on measurement outcomes, is widely employed to enhance system performance. Nevertheless, its impact on these fundamental bounds remains an open question. This work elucidates this influence by establishing a theoretical framework for quantum speed limit and quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation under a paradigmatic Markovian feedback protocol. We derive general inequalities incorporating the effects of feedback control on speed and precision. Through numerical simulations on a simple two-level system and quantum error correction, a key application of quantum feedback control, we validate our derived bounds and demonstrate that feedback control can indeed improve both speed and precision beyond those achievable limits in uncontrolled systems. Next, to elucidate the mechanism behind these improvements and the qualitative difference from uncontrolled dynamics, we analyze the governing thermodynamic costs, which are the fundamental quantities that constrain speed and precision, within a simple model. Our analysis reveals that feedback can improve the time scaling order of these costs. This modification of the dynamical scaling is the origin of the qualitative performance gain, signifying that the feedback-induced improvements of performance are not merely quantitative but represent a fundamental shift. Consequently, our work offers a comprehensive understanding of how feedback control impacts the fundamental limits on the speed and precision of quantum systems, providing crucial insights for designing high-performance quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</p>

            <p>Quantum information cannot be broadcast -- an intrinsic limitation imposed by quantum mechanics. However, recent advances in virtual operations offer new insights into the no-broadcasting theorem. Here, we focus on the practical utility and introduce sample efficiency as a fundamental constraint, requiring any practical broadcasting protocol perform no worse than the naïve approach of direct preparation and distribution. We prove that no linear process -- whether quantum or beyond -- can simultaneously uphold sample efficiency, unitary covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency. This leads to a no-practical-broadcasting theorem, which places strict limits on the practical distribution of quantum information. By applying Schur-Weyl duality, we establish the uniqueness of the canonical 1-to-$N$ virtual broadcasting map that satisfies the latter three conditions, provide its construction, and determine its sample complexity through semidefinite programming. Finally, we explore the interplay between virtual broadcasting and a quantum spacetime framework, known as the pseudo-density operator, showing that their correspondence holds only in the 1-to-2 case, underscoring the fundamental asymmetry between spatial and temporal statistics in the quantum world.</p>

            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme within a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, wherein a mechanical resonator is coupled to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the open-quantum-system framework. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unstable system dynamics. Moreover, the squeezing level can surpass the maximum achievable under stable system conditions. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <p>Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge.

By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Distillation of multipartite entangled states for arbitrary subsets of parties in noisy quantum networks of increasing size</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aitor Balmaseda, Julio I. de Vicente</p>
            <p>Quantum network states are multipartite states built from distributing pairwise entanglement among parties and underpin the paradigm of quantum networks for quantum information processing. In this work we introduce the problem of partial distillability in noisy quantum networks. This corresponds to the possibility of distilling by local operations and classical communication an arbitrary pure state for an arbitrary subset of parties starting from a single copy of a quantum network state of an increasing number of parties that share noisy (i.e. mixed) bipartite entangled states. Here, distillation means that the target state is obtained with fidelity as close to 1 as desired as the size of the network increases when the pairwise entangled links support a constant amount of noise. While we prove an obstruction to multipartite distillation protocols after teleportation with channels with constant noise, we show that partial distillability is indeed possible if certain well-established graph-theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity in the network grow fast enough with its size. We give necessary as well as sufficient conditions for partial distillability in terms of these parameters and we moreover provide explicit constructions of networks with partial distillability and a relatively slow connectivity growth.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mpemba effect without global symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanmay Bhore, Lei Su, Ivar Martin, Aashish A. Clerk, Zlatko Papić</p>
            <p>The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of Noisy Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ferran Riera-Sàbat, Jorge Miguel-Ramiro, Wolfgang Dür</p>
            <p>Complex quantum networks are not only hard to establish, but also difficult to simulate due to the exponentially growing state space and noise-induced imperfections. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that leverage quantum computers and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices as simulators for quantum networks, including noisy quantum devices, channels, and protocols. Rather than considering noise as an undesired property that needs to be mitigated, we demonstrate how imperfections in quantum hardware can be utilized to simulate real-world communication devices under realistic conditions beyond classical simulation capabilities. Our approach allows NISQ devices with modest noise to simulate devices with more significant imperfections enabling large-scale, detailed simulations of quantum networks, where exact error models can be treated. It also improves over direct implementation and benchmarking of real networks, as waiting times for information transmission, locality, and memory restrictions do not apply. This framework can offer advantages in flexibility, scalability, and precision, demonstrating that NISQ devices can serve as natural testbeds for complex quantum networks, and paving the way for more efficient quantum network simulations.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Extraction of Coherent Ergotropy and Its Energetic Cost in a Superconducting Qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Li, Silu Zhao, Yun-Hao Shi, Kai Xu, Heng Fan, Dongning Zheng, Zhongcheng Xiang</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence, encoded in the off-diagonal elements of a system's density matrix, is a key resource in quantum thermodynamics, fundamentally limiting the maximum extractable work known as ergotropy. While previous experiments have isolated coherence-related contributions to work extraction, it remains unclear how coherence can be harnessed in a controllable and energy-efficient manner. Here, we experimentally investigate the role of initial-state coherence in work extraction from a superconducting transmon qubit. By preparing a variety of pure states and implementing three complementary extraction protocols, we reveal how coherence governs the partitioning of ergotropy. We find that the choice of initial state depends on the dominant decoherence channel-energy relaxation or dephasing. By further accounting for thermodynamic costs, we identify optimal initial states that maximize the efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the initial-state design provides a scalable approach to coherence control and advances the development of efficient quantum thermodynamic devices.</p>

            <p>Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</p>

            <p>We study the entanglement structure of tripartite stabilizer states on $N$ qudits of dimension $D$, distributed across parties $A$, $B$, and $C$, under arbitrary local unitaries. Prior work by Bravyi et al. and Looi et al. showed that qubit and squarefree qudit stabilizer states can be transformed via local Clifford unitaries into tensor products of GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0504208, arXiv:1107.1761]. We generalize this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits. Our algorithm leverages subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and applies to quantum protocols requiring efficient entanglement distribution.</p>

            <p>The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes--anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that a four-wave mixing-like correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation and completely characterizes the non-resonant SaS photon pair production. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</p>

            <p>We address the challenge of multi-target quantum optimization, where the objective is to simultaneously optimize multiple cost functions defined over the same quantum search space. To accelerate optimization and reduce quantum resource usage, we investigate a range of strategies that enable knowledge transfer between related tasks. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage framework consisting of a training phase where solutions are progressively shared across tasks and an inference phase, where unoptimized targets are initialized based on prior optimized ones. We propose and evaluate several methods, including warm-start initialization, parameter estimation via first-order Taylor expansion, hierarchical clustering with D-level trees, and deep learning-based transfer. Our experimental results, using parameterized quantum circuits implemented with PennyLane, demonstrate that transfer techniques significantly reduce the number of required iterations while maintaining an acceptable cost value. These findings highlight the promise of multi-target generalization in quantum optimization pipelines and provide a foundation for scalable multi-target quantum optimization.</p>

            <p>In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally connected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and arrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with a QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the scaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with the graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size growth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential advantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at least polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm considered relative to an efficient classical linear solver. Within the scope of our analyses, we observe that only 4% of the 50 considered graph families offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20% of the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we observe and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only fare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm but also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial advantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given the limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical studies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families into one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may face even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</p>

            <h2>Fault-tolerant transformations of spacetime codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Pesah, Austin K. Daniel, Ilan Tzitrin, Michael Vasmer</p>
            <p>Recent advances in quantum error-correction (QEC) have shown that it is often beneficial to understand fault-tolerance as a dynamical process, a circuit with redundant measurements that help correct errors, rather than as a static code equipped with a syndrome extraction circuit. Spacetime codes have emerged as a natural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while leveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on chain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations between them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding problems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence of two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain complexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits, fault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this framework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer codes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be transformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant properties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the underlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex constructions. Our method enables the construction of cluster states from non-CSS, subsystem, and Floquet codes, as well as from logical Clifford operations on a given code.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Aydin, Victor V. Albert, Alexander Barg</p>
            <p>We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms, ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.</p>

            <p>Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Paeckel</p>
            <p>The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</p>

We show how magnetic moment effects are included in either version of electrodynamics and that these apparently different formulations can give consistent results. In either case, we express the interactions in terms of electromagnetic fields only, avoiding use of a vector potential. The main focus is on magnetic dipole interactions, and magnetic monopole interactions are not considered.</p>

            <p>Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori</p>
            <p>It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has the desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors from several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation remain small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis</p>
            <p>We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.</p>

            <p>Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</p>

By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schrödinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.</p>

            <p>The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</p>

To overcome these limitations, we introduce VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Jie Chang, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.</p>

The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</p>

            <h2>Thermal reconstruction of chaotic quantum many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shozab Qasim, Jason Pollack</p>
            <p>Thermal states are thermal with respect to a fixed Hamiltonian. How much information about this Hamiltonian can we ``bootstrap'' from the subsystems of a thermal state? We attack the problem by positioning it as a subspecies of the quantum marginal problem. In states that obey the quantum Markov property, the Petz recovery map captures the knowledge of the larger system inherent in a subsystem. We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction breaks down at low temperatures.</p>

            <p>We ask how quantum correlations can be distributed among many subsystems. To address this, we define entanglement sharing schemes (ESS) where certain pairs of subsystems allow entanglement to be recovered via local operations, while other pairs must not. ESS schemes come in two variants, one where the partner system with which entanglement should be prepared is known, and one where it is not. In the case of known partners, we fully characterize the access structures realizable for ESS when using stabilizer states, and construct efficient schemes for threshold access structures, and give a conjecture for the access structures realizable with general states. In the unknown partner case, we again give a complete characterization in the stabilizer setting, additionally give a complete characterization of the case where there are no restrictions on unauthorized pairs, and we prove a set of necessary conditions on general schemes which we conjecture are also sufficient. Finally, we give an application of the theory of entanglement sharing to resolve an open problem related to the distribution of entanglement in response to time-sensitive requests in quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and Control of Two Coupled Quantum Oscillators: An Analytical Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Abu-Nada, Lian-Ao Wu</p>
            <p>We analyze two coupled quantum oscillators in a common Lorentzian environment and control them by detuning (temporarily shifting) their frequencies. The reduced dynamics are solved exactly, without Born or Markov approximations, by propagating each detuning segment in closed form. We study two control schedules: regular detuning, with perfectly periodic on and off pulses of fixed period, width, and amplitude; and irregular detuning, with the same on/off structure but cycle-to-cycle jitter in period, width, and amplitude. Our main observable is the average excitation number (AEN) of each mode. Detuning moves the system away from the bath's spectral peak, suppressing decoherence and damping non-Markovian revivals; in effectively Markovian baths the benefit is small. We quantify performance with a simple time-domain suppression factor. Larger detuning amplitudes and higher duty cycles yield stronger protection. Irregular control is slightly weaker at low duty cycle but becomes comparable to regular control as the duty cycle approaches one. These results give practical design rules linking detuning, duty cycle, and bath width, and provide an exact benchmark for controlled non-Markovian dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdelmouheymen Rabah Khamadja, Mohamed Taha Rouabah</p>
            <p>This thesis investigates sampling-based quantum algorithms for electronic ground state energy estimation, focusing on Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) and Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) as near-term alternatives to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Unlike VQE, which suffers from barren plateaus and high measurement costs, these methods avoid variational optimization by sampling Slater determinants from quantum hardware and performing diagonalization classically. The central contribution is the first analytical expression for the sampling bottleneck: the determinant-discovery step is mapped to the classical coupon-collector problem, yielding both an exact formula and a scalable lower-bound estimator for the number of measurements required to recover all determinants contributing to the ground state. Previous work only relied on numerical sampling and estimation. The analysis is validated through simulations, hardware-calibrated noisy studies, and execution on IBM's 127-qubit IBM Brisbane processor, demonstrating the dominant role of sampling efficiency in the near-term feasibility of QSCI and SQD.

            <p>Multi-photon correlations from quantum emitters coupled to vibrational environments lie beyond the reach of standard tools such as the quantum regression theorem (QRT). Here, we introduce a Markovian framework for computing frequency-resolved $N$-photon correlation functions that overcomes this limitation. Applying our approach to a driven semiconductor quantum dot provides a tractable description of phonon effects on fluorescence beyond the single-photon spectrum. Our method accurately captures the emergence of the phonon sideband, missed by conventional QRT treatments, and reveals rich phonon-induced structure in the filtered two-photon spectrum. Strikingly, we find that photons emitted via the phonon sideband inherit second-order coherence properties of the Mollow triplet.</p>

            <p>We study the limitations on observing transient amplification in atomic systems exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and evaluate the limits of optical Bloch equation (OBE) models. Using propagation-based Maxwell-Bloch simulations, we show that single-atom, spatially uniform OBE treatments overestimate gain by neglecting propagation dynamics. In two-level systems, this yields incorrect transmission, while in three-level systems, it predicts unrealistically large amplification. Furthermore, we show that Doppler averaging in warm vapor suppresses oscillatory ringing and the maximum achievable gain. Our results explain discrepancies between OBE predictions and experimental observations, and establish practical limits on transient gain in cold and thermally broadened EIT media.</p>

            <p>We describe a deterministic and experimentally feasible protocol for generating entangled pairs of ultracold neutral atoms through controlled dissociation of diatomic Feshbach molecules. The dissociation process naturally produces nonlocal quantum correlations in spin, position-momentum, and path degrees of freedom, enabling the deterministic preparation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of massive particles and multiqubit states through hyperentangled encoding. Having each atom of the pair prepared in a matter waveguide, the scheme can be scaled to hundreds of parallel entanglement sources in an array connected to a matter wave optical network of beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometers, tunnel junctions and local detectors. The protocol builds on established techniques, including programmable optical potentials, high-fidelity single-particle control, single-molecule initialization, controlled molecular dissociation, and quantum gas microscopy with near-perfect detection, making it directly implementable with current technology. The proposed architecture naturally integrates with atomtronics circuits and chip-based matter-wave optics, offering a deterministic entanglement source for quantum nonlocality tests, precision metrology, and scalable neutral-atom quantum processors.</p>

For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers. However, we show that optimized fully symmetric Gaussian states enable rapidly approaching perfect privacy while maintaining near-optimal sensing performance. We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision.

            <p>Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Tsunaki, Michael Dotan, Kseniia Volkova, Boris Naydenov</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a general protocol for realizing fast high-fidelity multi-qubit gates, through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. This way, we are able to control the states of the target qubits by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow error-prone direct control. The DD-gate protocol is developed and experimentally implemented within two distinct frameworks: a hardware-agnostic model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked within a general-purpose digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Likewise, we are able to thoroughly characterize the quantum mechanical dynamics behind the multi-qubit gates within IBMQ, without many of the experimental constraints faced by other quantum systems. While at the same time, we establish the protocol for the $^{15}$NV system, considering its specific properties. The DD-gates with $^{15}$NVs can represent a significant reduction in gate times and improved technological scalability, compared to current methods of target qubit control using dynamical decoupling. In addition, we propose a simple application of the method for high-efficiency polarization generation of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin. All experimental findings are supported by comprehensive open-source simulations in the two distinct frameworks. This work provides a robust hardware-agnostic strategy for quantum control, which can be implemented with arbitrary systems that fit the central-target qubits description. Thus, marking an essential step in technological scalability of future quantum devices.</p>

Mature semiclassical approaches reach their limits when confronted with quantized electromagnetic fields, while full Hilbert space treatments are often computationally prohibitive. To address these challenges, we develop a framework based on coupled stochastic processes with a common cross-covariance structure that can be easily coupled to various types of Maxwell solvers. Our approach accounts for the non-commutativity in the quantum-to-classical transition in a natural way, and has the ability to capture quantum optical signatures while retaining compatibility with classical electromagnetics. For benchmarking, we compare our simulation results with experimental emission spectra of a strongly driven InGaAs quantum dot, finding excellent agreement.

            <p>Estimating a classical parameter encoded in the Hamiltonian of a quantum probe is a fundamental and well-understood task in quantum metrology. A textbook example is the estimation of a classical field's amplitude using a two-level probe, as described by the semi-classical Rabi model. In this work, we explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent quantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom. For both metrological scenarios, we focus on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state of the atomic probe. In the semi-classical Rabi model, the QFI is independent of the field amplitude and grows quadratically with the interaction time $\tau$. In contrast, when the atom interacts with a single coherent mode of the field, the QFI is bounded by 4, a constant dictated by the non-orthogonality of coherent states. We find that this bound can only be approached in the vacuum limit. In the limit of large amplitude $\alpha$, the QFI is found to attain its maximal value $1.47$ at $\tau =O(1)$ and $\tau =O(\alpha^2)$, and also shows periodic revivals at much later times. When the atom interacts with a sequence of coherent states, the QFI can increase with time but is bounded to scale linearly due to the production of entanglement between the atom and the radiation (back-action), except in the limit where the number of modes and their total energy diverge. Finally, in the continuous limit, where the atom interacts with many weak coherent states, this back-action can be simply interpreted as spontaneous emission, giving rise to the optimal interaction time and QFI rate.</p>

            <p>Resonant energy transfer (RET), between equal parity 1s65s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ and 1s66s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ Rydberg levels in helium has been observed in low-temperature ($\sim80$ mK) collisions with ammonia molecules which undergo inversion transitions in their X$^1$A$_1$ ground electronic state. This hybrid Rydberg-atom polar-molecule RET represents a monopole-dipole energy exchange reaction that necessarily requires spatial overlap of the Rydberg-electron and molecular wavefunctions. Calculations, explicitly accounting for the charge-dipole interaction between the Rydberg electron and the molecular dipole, provide a quantitative explanation of the observations. Total parity is conserved in the reaction through the mixing of collisional angular momentum in the atom-molecule complex. This work opens opportunities to expand the toolbox of hybrid neutral-atom polar-molecule platforms for quantum science with charge-dipole mediated energy exchange.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have searched for evidence of the impact of non-inertial motion on the entanglement of particles. The success of these endeavours has been hindered by the fact that such tests were performed within spatial scales that were only "local" when compared to the spatial scales over which the non-inertial motion was taking place. We propose a Sagnac-like interferometer that, by challenging such bottlenecks, is able to achieve entangled states through a mechanism induced by the mechanical rotation of a photonic interferometer. The resulting states violate the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequality all the way up to the Tsirelson bound, thus signalling strong quantum nonlocality. Furthermore, we show that the Bell-CHSH inequality remains violated even without using any form of post-selection up to the value $1+\sqrt{2}$. Our results demonstrate that mechanical rotation can be thought of as resource for controlling quantum non-locality with implications also for recent proposals for experiments that can probe the quantum nature of curved spacetimes and non-inertial motion.</p>

            <p>We have analyzed the dynamics of entanglement in dissipative fermionic and bosonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models and found that, when the decoherence channel preserves the chiral symmetry, they exhibit a revival of entanglement in a wide range of parameters. This behavior only emerges in the topological phase, with the visibility of the revival dropping to zero at the phase boundary. Furthermore, the revival acquires a universal character once the system size exceeds the localization length of the edge modes. Our findings indicate that the universal entanglement revival has its origin in the topological properties of the SSH model.

Bringing two semi-infinite heat baths at different temperatures into thermal contact along a surface, the NESS arises at asymptotically late times as a stationary state that has modewise thermal properties and features a heat flow between the reservoirs. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the transition rate with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not couple to the heat flow, causing the detector to only register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</p>

QBlue is based on the formalism of second quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics, from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue, including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

            <p>Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can, for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity, we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum information, complexity theory, and cryptography.</p>

            <h2>Excited-CAFQA: A classical simulation bootstrap for the variational estimation of molecular excited states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bikrant Bhattacharyya, Gokul Ravi</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are iterative algorithms suited to implementation on current-era quantum devices. VQAs employ classical optimization to minimize cost functions evaluated on quantum circuits. However, the extent to which VQAs manage noise is often insufficient for quantum chemistry applications. One method of improving VQAs is through accurate ansatz initialization. The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurav Suman, Bikash K. Behera, Vivek Vyas, Prasanta k. Panigrahi</p>
            <p>Anharmonic potential quantum system play crucial role in physics as they provide a more realistic description of oscillatory phenomena, which often deviate from the idealized harmonic model. However, simulating such system on classical computers is highly challenging due to nonlinear interactions, large state spaces, and the exponential scaling of memory and computational resources. In this work, quantum simulation is employed to model a quantum anharmonic oscillator (QAHO) using a 3-qubit system implemented on IBM's Quantum Experiences platform. A quantum circuit with a filter-based design and Toffoli gates is constructed to track quantum state evolution, capturing key phenomena like quantum revival. The framework is further extended to n-qubit system to enhance resolution and scalability. For energy estimation, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a TwoLocal ansatz and variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), are used to compute ground and excited state energies. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy with an error of only 1.11% compared to exact methods. Notably, VQE outperforms classical approximations such as perturbation theory (error 6.71%) and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation(error 5.36%), yielding more precise energy values. These results highlight the potential of quantum simulation and VQD as effective tools for investigating complex quantum system, paving the way for future application in quantum chemistry and materials science as quantum hardware continues to advance.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we explore (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED) at finite density on a quantum computer, including two fermion flavors. Our method employs an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit structure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our simulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification of phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors. Classical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters, which are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude by discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to larger systems.</p>

            <h2>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muzamil Shah, Shahid Qamar, Muhammad Waseem</p>
            <p>This paper theoretically investigates the manipulation of the Photonic Spin Hall Effect (photonic SHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in a cavity. The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable photonic SHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance under the condition of electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT), the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits photonic SHE similar to the CTL system, showing a maximum upper limit of photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist. This upper limit arises due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence photonic SHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence photonic SHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning photonic SHE. Finally, the results are equally valid and applicable to conventional $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity atomic systems. The results of angular photonic SHE are also discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ron Belyansky, Cheyne Weis, Ryo Hanai, Peter B. Littlewood, Aashish A. Clerk</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require post-selection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>A parametric down-conversion source interfering on a beam splitter can be described as both a source of entangled N00N-states or a source of independent, and thus uncorrelated squeezers. The disparity between these outcomes can be attributed to whether one takes a standard discrete- or continuous-variable approach to describing the system. More precisely, this difference in output is due to the types of measurements involved and the way in which the data is processed, as both setups are identical, clearly identical states are produced. Here we take a hybrid approach to describe the state, which is generated by parametric down-conversion as input state, and investigate the measurements of the output ports of the interferometer using photon number resolved detection. We show that the output of this interference is separable in the photon number picture and demonstrate the worth of photon-number correlation measures for the characterization of squeezed light sources for hybrid applications like Gaussian boson-sampling.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian simulation is a central application of quantum computing, with significant potential in modeling physical systems and solving complex optimization problems. Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus on low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability and offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation pipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for compiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics, from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue, including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose performing key operations in quantum computation and communication using room-temperature atoms moving across a grid of high-quality-factor, small-mode-volume cavities. These cavities enable high-cooperativity interactions with single atoms to be achieved with a characteristic timescale much shorter than the atomic transit time, allowing multiple coherent operations to take place. We study scenarios where we can drive a Raman transition to generate photons with specific temporal shapes and to absorb, and hence detect, single photons. The strong atom-cavity interaction can also be used to implement the atom-photon controlled-phase gate, which can then be used to construct photon-photon gates, create photonic cluster states, and perform non-demolition detection of single photons. We provide numerics validating our methods and discuss the implications of our results for several applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Rivera-Dean, D. Kanti, P. Stammer, N. Tsatrafyllis, M. Lewenstein, P. Tzallas</p>
            <p>Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong-field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on interactions with single-atoms only, neglecting that under realistic conditions light propagates through the media. This raises two key questions: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media, and under what conditions it can generate observable nonlinear signals? We address these questions by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media using high-harmonic generation as a nonlinear observable. We found that the infrared photon losses, atomic ground-state depletion and atomic ionization, induce decoherence effects which significantly limit the propagation length in the medium, and reduce the harmonic yield by more than two orders of magnitude compared to that produced by coherent laser light. Nevertheless, we establish the conditions under which BSV generated harmonics can be detected. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation in all states of matter.</p>

            <p>Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for building scalable quantum networks, with electro-optics conversion emerging as a promising approach. Recent experiments, however, observe significant quality factor degradation in superconducting microwave cavities when realizing the electro optics transducers. Here, we identify the piezomechanical scattering, where microwave photon loss through phonon radiation into substrate, as a universal dissipation mechanism in these hybrid quantum devices. By establishing a direct analogy to Rayleigh scattering theory, we derive universal scaling laws governing phononic dissipation process. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off that optimizing coherent transduction coupling inevitably increases dissipation, regardless of the configurations of microwave and optical cavities. We propose potential strategies to overcome this challenge. These findings establish piezomechanical scattering as a critical design constraint for quantum transducers and provide insights to optimize their performances toward practical quantum networking.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a highly sensitive real-time magnetometry method at two measurement points. This magnetometry method is based on the frequency-division multiplexing of continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance. We use two ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers separated by 3.6 mm to measure a magnetic field. A different bias field is applied to the two NV ensembles to resolve the resonance peak for each ensemble in the frequency space and enables the multiplexed magnetometry at the two points. The sensitivities achieved at the measurement points are $21~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and $22~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$. The proposed magnetometry method can be expanded to include more measurement points and shorter spacing. The capability of real-time measurement at numerous points with short spacing and high sensitivity is beneficial for various applications, including biomagnetic sensing, geophysical research, and material science.</p>

            <p>The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields -- a fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$~G, provide unique astrophysical laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at $\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong decrease in polarization from 2~keV to 4~keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence (VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.</p>

            <p>Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip. Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss. Together, these advances pave the way to the scalable assembly of optically addressable quantum memory arrays which are a key building block for modular photonic quantum interconnects.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill States on a Quantum Torus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijo K. Joseph, Sudhir Singh</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel formulation of a Generalized Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state that resolves all of its foundational pathologies, such as infinite energy, non-normalizability, and or- thogonality. We demonstrate that these issues are artifacts of defining the code on an unbounded phase-space. By considering the compact quantum-phase-space intrinsic to systems like coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, we have obtained a Generalized GKP (GGKP) state that is both exact and physically realizable. This is achieved by applying an obtained Quantum Zak Transform (QZT) to Squeezed Coherent States, which reveals that Riemann-Theta functions are the natural representation of these states on the quantum torus phase-space. This framework not only provides a well-behaved quantum state, but also reveals a deep connection between quantum error correc- tion, non-commutative geometry, and the theory of generalized Theta functions. This opens a new avenue for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Fairly quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structures (such as symmetries or encodings) is a fundamental challenge for benchmarking quantum technologies. We introduce the "Reference-Contingent Complexity" (RCC). Its core idea is to utilize the quantum relative entropy to measure the extent to which a state deviates from its "structured vacuum" (the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace), thereby only pricing the generation of non-trivial information. We establish a central theorem, establishing that the RCC is a rigorous information-theoretic lower bound on universal quantum circuit complexity, a bound that features a linear leading term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction for the non-uniformity of the spectral distribution. Furthermore, we establish an operational protocol based on quantum hypothesis testing, which connects this theoretical lower bound to experimentally accessible observables. This work provides a structurally-fair yardstick for quantum technologies and offers a new perspective for exploring the intrinsic connection between computational cost and the generation of non-trivial information.</p>

            <p>Quantum decoherence provides a framework to study the emergence of classicality from quantum system by showing how interactions with the environments suppress interferences and select robust states known as pointer states. Earlier studies have linked Gaussian coherent states with pointer states. More recently, it was conjectured that more general quantum states called joint momenta-coordinates states could also be considered as more suitable candidates to be pointer states. These states are associated to the concept of quantum phase space and saturate, by definition, generalized uncertainty relations. In this work, we rigorously prove this conjecture. Building on the Lindblad framework for the damped harmonic oscillator and applying Zurek's predictability-sieve criterion, we analyze both underdamped and overdamped regimes. We show that only in the underdamped case do joint momenta-coordinates states remain pure and robust for all times, establishing them as the true pointer states. This extends Isar's earlier underdamped treatment, generalizes the concept beyond Gaussian approximations, and embeds classical robustness in the quantum phase space formalism, with potential applications in error-resilient quantum information.</p>

            <p>Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.</p>

            <p>Accurately predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology, with profound implications for understanding biological functions and enabling structure-based drug discovery. Quantum computing approaches based on coarse-grained lattice models combined with variational algorithms have been proposed as an initial step towards predicting protein structures using quantum computers. In this work, we introduce a more efficient quantum protein structure prediction workflow that bypasses the need for explicit Hamiltonian construction by employing a problem-agnostic ansatz. The ansatz is trained to minimize an energy-based cost function that can be efficiently computed on classical computers, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing circuit depth compared to previous Hamiltonian-based methods. This enables a more scalable approach for larger proteins and facilitates the inclusion of higher-order interactions, previously hard to achieve in quantum approaches. We validate our method by benchmarking a hardware-efficient ansatz on a large set of proteins with up to 26 amino acids, modeled on the tetrahedral, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic lattices, incorporating up to second-nearest-neighbor interactions. We assess the performance on both a noise-free simulator and the ibm_kingston quantum computer using a set of distinct metrics to probe different aspects of the prediction quality. These experiments push the boundaries of quantum methods for protein structure prediction, targeting sequences that are longer than those typically addressed in prior studies. Overall, the results highlight the scalability and versatility of our approach, while also identifying key areas for improvement to inform future algorithm development and hardware advancements.</p>

            <p>We present a family of simple three-dimensional stabilizer codes, called the chiral color codes, that realize fermionic and chiral topological orders. In the qubit case, the code realizes the topological phase of a single copy of the fermionic toric code. For qudit systems with local dimension $d$, the model features a chiral parameter $\alpha$ and realizes 3D topological phases characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_d^{(\alpha)}$ anyon theories with anomalous chiral surface topological order. On closed manifolds, the code has a unique ground state after removing bulk transparent fermions or bosons. Furthermore, we prove that the bulk is short-range entangled (for odd $d$, coprime $\alpha$) by constructing an explicit local quantum channel that prepares the ground state. The chiral color codes are constructed within the gauge color code, and hence inherit its fault-tolerant features: they admit single-shot error correction and allow code switching to other stabilizer color codes. These properties position the chiral color codes as particularly useful platforms for realizing and manipulating fermions and chiral anyons.</p>

            <p>Optimal strategies for local quantum metrology -- including the preparation of optimal probe states, implementation of optimal control and measurement strategies, are well established. However, for distributed quantum metrology, where the goal is to estimate global properties of multiple spatially distributed parameters, the optimal scheme -- particularly the role of optimal control -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we address this challenge by developing optimal schemes for distributed quantum metrology that characterize the ultimate precision limits in distributed systems. We derive the optimal probe state, optimal control protocols, and measurement strategies in estimating a linear combination of $N$ independent unknown parameters coupled to $d$ networked sensors. Crucially, we prove that the optimal control operations can be implemented locally on each sensor, eliminating the need for non-local control operations across distant nodes. This result significantly reduces the complexity of implementing optimal strategies in distributed quantum metrology. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we apply it to several key scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Q. Guo, Shi-Lei Su, Weibin Li, X. Q. Shao</p>
            <p>We propose a dissipative protocol for preparing nonequilibrium steady-state entanglement in neutral atom arrays within a Floquet-Lindblad framework. Stabilizer pumping is implemented through noninstantaneous kicks, where each period consists of a short resonant laser pulse followed by a detuned strong $\pi$ pulse that couples the atomic ground state to a Rydberg state. This scheme is intrinsically fast and robust against the Doppler shifts and interatomic spatial fluctuations, as adiabatic requirements on the laser field are avoided. As such the engineered dissipation channels induce a fast decay rate, dramatically accelerating convergence toward the desired steady states. We show that this approach is inherently scalable and enables high-fidelity preparation of arbitrary multipartite graph states in the neutral atom array at zero and finite temperatures. Our study not only facilitates the preparation of resource states for measurement-based quantum computation but also provides a passive error-correction mechanism in the undergoing computation.</p>

            <p>Entanglement generation lies at the heart of many quantum networking protocols as it enables distributed and modular quantum computing. For superconducting qubits, entanglement fidelity is typically limited by photon loss in the links that connect these qubits together. We propose and realize a new scheme for heralded entanglement generation that almost entirely circumvents this limit. We produce Bell states with $92\pm1\%$ state fidelity, including state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, between separated superconducting bosonic qubits in a high-loss regime where direct deterministic state transfer fails. Our scheme exploits simple but fundamental physics found in microwave links, specifically the ability to treat our communication channel as a single standing wave mode. Combining this with local measurements on bosonically encoded qubits allows us to herald entanglement with success probabilities approaching the scheme's upper limit of 50% per attempt. We then use the heralded Bell state as a resource to deterministically teleport a qubit between modules with an average state transfer fidelity of $90\pm1\%$. This is achieved despite the link possessing a direct single photon transfer efficiency of 2%. Our work informs the design of future superconducting quantum networks, by demonstrating fast coupling rates and low loss links are no longer strict requirements for high-fidelity quantum communication in the microwave regime.</p>

            <p>Bell state measurements, which project bipartite qubit systems onto the maximally entangled Bell basis, are central to a wide range of quantum information processing tasks, including quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, and fusion-gate quantum computation. In photonic quantum platforms, where information is encoded in optical degrees of freedom, the realization of efficient Bell state measurements is particularly challenging, especially when constrained to linear optical elements. In this review, we provide a comprehensive examination of existing proposals for implementing Bell state measurements, highlighting their fundamental limitations and the strategies developed to overcome them. Additionally, we survey recent advances in Bell state measurements for high-dimensional systems, an area of growing interest due to its relevance in scalable quantum networks and high-capacity quantum communication.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Optomagnonic dielectric resonators offer a promising platform for the bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons at the single quantum level. Current implementation of such a conversion lacks from low magneto-optical interaction strength, limiting its practical utilization in quantum technologies. The main bottleneck is the small spatial overlap between optical and magnon modes. Here, we show that utilization of a disk and ring geometries notably increases the mode overlap. We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible. Strategies for further improvements of interactions are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iren Simko, Norah M. Hoffmann</p>
            <p>Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is fundamentally quantum or classical is essential for building accurate theoretical models and guiding experimental design. Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengfei Zhang, Shuyan Zhou, Ning Sun</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</p>

            <p>Exploiting quantum measurements is a promising route for preparation of correlated quantum states. We use methods from large deviation theory to solve this problem exactly for a specific system: the deterministic quantum East circuit with boundary measurements. We show that conditioning on measurement outcomes generates a long-range correlated state, despite typical trajectories being trivial. We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to the Sierpiński triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning for Quantum Noise Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karan Kendre</p>
            <p>Quantum noise fundamentally limits the utility of near-term quantum devices, making error mitigation essential for practical quantum computation. While traditional quantum error correction codes require substantial qubit overhead and complex syndrome decoding, we propose a machine learning approach that directly reconstructs clean quantum states from noisy density matrices without additional qubits. We formulate quantum noise reduction as a supervised learning problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder architecture with a novel fidelity-aware composite loss function. Our method is trained and evaluated on a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 10,000 density matrices derived from random 5-qubit quantum circuits, encompassing five noise types (depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, bit-flip, and mixed noise) across four intensity levels (0.05-0.20). The CNN successfully reconstructs quantum states across all noise conditions, achieving an average fidelity improvement from 0.298 to 0.774 ({\Delta} = 0.476). Notably, the model demonstrates superior performance on complex mixed noise scenarios and higher noise intensities, with mixed noise showing the highest corrected fidelity (0.807) and improvement (0.567). The approach effectively preserves both diagonal elements (populations) and off-diagonal elements (quantum coherences), making it suitable for entanglement-dependent quantum algorithms. While phase damping presents fundamental information-theoretic limitations, our results suggest that CNN-based density matrix reconstruction offers a promising, resource-efficient alternative to traditional quantum error correction for NISQ-era devices. This data-driven approach could enable practical quantum advantage with fewer physical qubits than conventional error correction schemes require.</p>

            <p>We investigate a theoretical protocol for the dissipative stabilization of mechanical quantum states in a multimode optomechanical system composed of multiple optical and mechanical modes. The scheme employs a single squeezed reservoir that drives one of the optical modes, while the remaining optical modes mediate an effective phonon-phonon interaction Hamiltonian. The interplay between these coherent interactions and the dissipation provided by the squeezed bath enables the steady-state preparation of targeted quantum states of the mechanical modes. In the absence of significant uncontrolled noise sources, the resulting dynamics closely approximate the model introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 020402 (2021)]. We analyze the performance of this protocol in generating mechanical cluster states defined on rectangular graphs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Kongkui Berinyuy, C. Tchodimou, P. Djorwé, S. K. Singh, S. G. Nana Engo</p>
            <p>We introduce and conduct a theoretical analysis of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system, presenting a framework for generating multipartite quantum entanglement that is both robust and highly adjustable. The system leverages a sophisticated synergy of collective molecular enhancement, nonreciprocal directional coupling, and engineered $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dissipation. A central finding is the exceptional thermal resilience of this entanglement, which persists robustly at and well above room temperature, with a practical operational ceiling limited by material stability around \SI{700}{\kelvin}. This remarkable resilience, driven by ultra-high-frequency molecular vibrations and collective $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement, positions our system as a leading candidate for developing robust, high-temperature quantum technologies. Notably, our work directly addresses the performance trade-offs inherent in nonlinear enhancement schemes. By employing a two-collective-mode model to explicitly investigate vibration-vibration correlations, our $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric architecture achieves a balanced and powerful enhancement across all investigated bipartite entanglement channels: inter-cavity ($E_{ac}$), cavity-molecule ($E_{aB_1}$, $E_{cB_2}$), and critically, vibration-vibration ($E_{B_1B_2}$). These findings, rigorously validated within stable operational regimes, establish $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric McOM as a versatile platform for engineering advanced quantum information technologies</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase transition in two dimension nonlinear cavity optomagnonic system</h2>

            <p>The superfluid-Mott insulator and ergodic-many body localization transitions based on a two dimension nonlinear cavity optomagnonic system are investigated, where a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is embedded at each site of a two-dimensional coupled cavity array. It can be demonstrated that, the introduction of phonon-photon coupling enhances the coherence of the system when considering the Kerr nonlinearity of the YIG sphere. In contrast, the Kerr nonlinearity of photons is more conducive to the Mott insulating phase than that of the YIG sphere. We further elucidate the underlying physical mechanism by calculating the effective repulsive potential of the system in the presence of photonic Kerr nonlinearity. Regarding the ergodic-many body localization transition, the results indicate that as the disorder strength of the Kerr nonlinearity increases, the system transitions from the ergodic phase to the many body localized phase, while increasing the chemical potential expands the region of the ergodic phase. This work provides a novel framework for characterizing quantum phase transitions in cavity optomagnonic systems and offers an experimentally feasible scheme for studying them, thereby yielding valuable insights for quantum simulation.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering strong light-matter interactions, presenting exciting opportunities for quantum science. However, a full understanding of their multi-excitation dynamics remains a significant challenge. In this work, we uncover a remarkable universal phenomenon that emerges in these arrays. Using scattering theory to analyze two-excitation interactions, we reveal a profound simplification near critical points of the collective atomic excitation band structure, determined solely from single-excitation properties. At these critical points, scattering becomes universal and the full two-excitation scattering matrix decomposes into a block-diagonal form. Remarkably, all scattering processes involving the photon field are completely suppressed, resulting in the perfect isolation of a unitary, nonlinear interaction channel between collective dark spin waves. Our findings provide exact analytical insights into few-body nonlinearities and establish a universal framework for analyzing complex scattering phenomena in ordered atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering light-matter interactions, enabling near-perfect single-photon mirrors and robust quantum memories based on long-lived dark spin waves. However, a comprehensive theory of their nonlinear, multi-excitation dynamics has remained a significant challenge. We present a unified quantum scattering theory that treats both photons and collective atomic spin waves as distinct propagating excitations interacting across different spatial dimensions. Our central result is a powerful analytical reduction: we demonstrate that the complete multi-channel S-matrix and the associated scattering cross sections are exactly determined by the effective scattering dynamics solely within the atomic spin wave subspace. This maps the complex physical problem of photon-atom interactions to a conceptually simpler one involving only atomic modes. We apply this formalism to the two-excitation case, deriving the complete analytical S-matrix and scattering cross sections for systems with two-level nonlinearities. Our work provides a versatile analytic tool for analyzing and engineering complex quantum nonlinear phenomena, including multi-excitation subradiance, in large-scale atomic systems.</p>

Remarkably, this maximum depends solely on the number of coherently superposed microstates. Based on this property, we introduce coherence-based definitions of entropy, temperature, and heat capacity, establishing a formal analogy with standard thermodynamic quantities.</p>

            <p>Coherent wavepacket expansion is a key component of recent proposals aiming to create non-classical states of a levitated dielectric nanoparticle. Free evolution, i.e., releasing the particle from its harmonic trapping potential and allowing its position variance to grow, is a simple but effective expansion scheme, but requires accurate force compensation to avoid significant mean displacements of the wavepacket during the free evolution. Here, using an optical trap-release-recapture sequence, we demonstrate an electrostatic compensation technique that enables free evolution without significant mean displacement in 3D, successfully compensating both gravity and stray electric fields. To achieve 100 microsecond free evolution times with charged particles, we developed methods to map and correct for force cross-talk, as well as to control the environmental charge state. Combined with a low decoherence environment, our approach enables the preparation of largely delocalized states without the need for long freefall trajectories or a low-gravity environment.</p>

            <p>Characterizing increasingly complex quantum systems is a central task in quantum information science, yet experimental costs often scale prohibitively with system size. Certifying key properties -- such as entanglement, circuit complexity, and quantum magic -- using simple local measurements is highly desirable but challenging. In this work, we introduce a highly general certification framework based on a physical phenomenon that we call localizable quantumness: for generic many-body states, essential quantum properties are robustly preserved within the projected ensembles on small subsystems after performing local projective measurements on the rest of the system. Leveraging this insight, we develop certification protocols that certify global properties by witnessing them on a small, accessible subsystem. Our method dramatically reduces experimental cost by relying solely on local Pauli measurements, while achieving constant sample complexity, constant-level noise robustness, and soundness for mixed states -- exponentially improving the sample complexity and overcoming major limitations of previous methods. We further present a random-basis variant to certify state fidelity, with numerical evidence strongly suggesting it maintains constant sample complexity and robustness for generic states, representing a substantial improvement over existing methods. Our results provide a practical, scalable toolkit for certifying large-scale quantum processors and offer a novel lens for understanding complex many-body quantum systems.</p>

As an alternative, we look for the initial states (pure or mixed) of the rotator that result in low entropy change. In order to create candidate initial states, we use an ansatz that align with the maximum entropy principle. We then find conditions for state preparation and system/bath parameters to achieve a small relative change in both linear and differential entropy in underdamped and non-underdamped regimes. We identify cases with relatively small entropy change and discuss their practical feasibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail S. Podoshvedov, Sergey A. Podoshvedov</p>
            <p>Continuous variable (CV) entanglement refers to the type of entanglement of quantum wave-like systems that are described by continuous variables in an inherently infinite-dimensional space. It can become a crucial resource for quantum communication, sensing and computation. We propose the mechanism of transfer of quantum entanglement (TQE) from a nonlocal photon to two initially separate single-mode squeezed vacuum (SMSV) states. The nonlocal photon is the only original quantum resource from which entanglement is transferred to CV states of a certain parity without them directly interacting with each other in a deterministic manner. Measurement induced CV parity entanglement is tuned using initial squeezing and the beam splitter (BS) parameter allowing us to estimate the probability of transfer of maximum entanglement at sufficiently high brightness to be 0.2344 . If, instead of the original SMSV states, we use those from which one photon is initially subtracted, then the heralded technique can turn the probabilistic maximum entanglement transfer protocol into a nearly deterministic one, the probability of which is >0.98. Such a perfect TQE from the nonlocal photon to a maximally parity-entangled CV state can be considered the most suitable for applications, since it preserves the trade-off between the probability and brightness of the output non-Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Quantum public-key encryption (PKE), where public-keys and/or ciphertexts can be quantum states, is an important primitive in quantum cryptography. Unlike classical PKE (e.g., RSA or ECC), quantum PKE can leverage quantum-secure cryptographic assumptions or the principles of quantum mechanics for security. It has great potential in providing for secure cryptographic systems under potentially weaker assumptions than is possible classically. In addition, it is of both practical and theoretical interest, opening the door to novel cryptographic systems not possible with classical information alone. While multiple quantum PKE schemes have been proposed, they require a large number of qubits acting coherently, and are not practical on current noisy quantum devices. In this paper, we design a practical quantum PKE scheme, taking into account the constraints of current NISQ devices. Specifically, we design a PKE scheme with quantum-classical public keys and classical ciphertexts, that is noise-resilient and only requires a small number of qubits acting coherently. In addition, our design provides tradeoffs in terms of efficiency and the number of qubits that are required.</p>

            <h2>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Batin Tank</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Sakashita (The University of Osaka)</p>
            <p>The XZZX code is a variant of the surface code designed to address biased noise in realistic quantum devices. For the XZZX code, we propose a decoder based on simulated annealing (SA). Our SA decoder can be readily and efficiently parallelized, by virtue of its simple MCMC-based algorithm. To prepare an initial configuration of SA, we propose to employ recovery chains obtained by a decoder which utilizes a kind of greedy matching graph algorithm. Although $Z$-biased noise is commonly assumed in real quantum devices, we focus on $Y$-biased noise, for which the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm fails to decode accurately. Our numerical simulation for the code capacity noise model, where only data qubits suffer errors, confirmed that our SA decoder is more accurate than the MWPM decoder. Furthermore, our SA decoder attained the accuracy equivalent to that of the optimal decoder formulated by integer programming, called CPLEX decoder. In our greedy matching decoder, we randomly determine order of matching pairs of incorrect syndromes that have the same distance. This randomness brings about a variety of initial configurations of SA, which leads to faster convergence of our SA decoder. By comparing decoding times of our SA decoder, the CPLEX decoder, and matrix product state (MPS) decoder, all of which can handle $Y$-biased noise appropriately, we confirmed that our SA decoder is fastest if parallelized. This result implies a potential for combining of our greedy matching and SA decoder for practical use in quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Recently, several researchers proposed portfolio optimization as a potential use case for quantum optimization. However, the literature is lacking an extensive benchmark quantifying the potential of quantum computers for portfolio optimization. In this work, we fill this gap. We provide a computational study, comparing quantum approaches against state-of-the-art classical methods on a meaningful, real-world instance set. In particular, we compare quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm against classical mixed-integer programming, simulated annealing, steepest descent local search, tabu search and a problem-tailored heuristics. We consider a variant of portfolio optimization which we show to be particular difficult for classical solvers in practice. Our benchmark comprises 250 instances with up to 1,000 assets from actual stock data. The results show that all instances can be solved to proven optimality by mixed-integer programming in the order of seconds. Moreover, the problem-tailored heuristic consistently outperforms quantum approaches in terms of solution quality for fixed runtime. Thus, we conclude that there is only very limited room for a potential quantum advantage in portfolio optimization.</p>

As an example, this decomposition is applied to a benchmark-quality approximate wave function of the lowest-energy quartet electronic state of the lithium atom. This wave function, which comprises hundreds of basis functions, is reduced to eleven shape blocks, only five of which are numerically significant. Such a compact characterization is a generic example of the appearance of superselection rules in configuration space, and provides a qualitative aid in the search for robust few-particle entangled states</p>

By considering the two-lowest energy eigenstates of this system as a {\it logical} qubit, we demonstrate that its coherence is significantly enhanced: both its pure dephasing and relaxation times are extended beyond those of individual {\it physical} qubits. Specifically, we show that by increasing either the interaction strength or the number of physical qubits in the chain, the logical qubit's pure dephasing rate is suppressed to zero, and its relaxation rate is reduced to half the relaxation rate of a single physical qubit. Single qubit and two-qubit gates can be performed with a high fidelity.</p>

            <h2>The incompleteness of relativistic Spekkens' contextuality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruben Campos Delgado</p>
            <p>We show that the operational definition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens is, in general, not Lorentz invariant. Specifically, we consider particle states with both spin and momentum, apply a Lorentz transformation to obtain the states in a new inertial frame, and then trace out the momentum degrees of freedom in both frames. We find that spin states that are contextual in one frame can become non-contextual in the other. Hence, the Spekkens' notion of contextuality, when restricted to spin states only, is a frame-dependent concept. We apply our results to predict a novel relativistic effect concerning the task of discriminating between two quantum states. We show that the probability of success for a moving observer exceeds that of an observer at rest.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of polymerized superconducting circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sean Crowe, Stefan Evans, Alexei Smolyaninov</p>
            <p>We apply polymer quantization, a quantization technique sometimes used in high energy physics, to several superconducting circuits including: transmons, transmission line resonators, and LC circuits. In the case of transmon qubits and transmission line resonators, experimental predictions are very close to what is found with canonical quantization, though in this approach constant charge offsets can be interpreted as quantization ambiguities. In the case of LC circuits, polymer quantization predicts nonlinearities which are not present in the canonical approach. Based on this analysis we design and analyze a qubit which uses a meander inductor instead of a Josephson junction. Implications for qubit performance and fabrication are discussed. Given a choice for an effective phase operator, relevant parameters such as anharmonicity, frequency, and dispersive shifts are calculated for this meander inductor based qubit.</p>

            <h2>Probing the Ground State of the Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model on the Kagome Lattice using Geometrically Informed Variational Quantum Eigensolver</h2>

            <p>This work investigates the nature of the ground state of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on minimal kagome cells -- a triangle and a star -- using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on real quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the ground state preparation is achievable using a shallow hardware-efficient quantum circuit with a naturally Euclidean parameter space. Our custom ansatz is capable of accurately recovering essential properties such as the spin correlation terms for each edge without explicit error mitigation. These features are found to be less sensitive to noise. We exploited the Fubini-Study metric in constructing the ansatz, ensuring a singularity-free parameter space. With this ansatz design, the quantum natural gradient coincides with the normal gradient, complemented with a backtracking search for dynamic step size adaptation. We refer to this regime as the implicit adaptive quantum natural gradient descent. It achieves faster convergence in fewer iterations compared to simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), while maintaining competitive runtime with the metric being analytically constant. We further apply error mitigation techniques, including zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) and qubit-wise readout error mitigation (REM). While ZNE does not obey the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle, the conditions under which REM preserves it are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Detection of long-range coherence in driven hot atomic vapors by spin noise spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rupak Bag, Sayari Majumder, Saptarishi Chaudhuri, Dibyendu Roy</p>
            <p>We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal a power-law decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.</p>

            <h2>Efficient formulation of quantum network under amplitude damping noise: Highlighting benefits over its Pauli-twirled counterpart</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudipta Mondal, Pritam Halder, Stav Haldar, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>At the heart of building a large-scale quantum internet lies the challenge of establishing long-distance entanglement using quantum repeaters, which mitigate direct transmission losses but introduce additional noise in the nodes via interactions with the environment and imperfect operations. This effect has typically been studied under a simplifying Pauli channel assumption. Our study focuses on distributing end-to-end entanglement in a homogeneous, repeater-based linear quantum network operating under a non-Pauli noise, specifically, amplitude damping noise, which we refer to as amplitude damping-affected quantum network (AQN). Unlike its twirled counterpart (TAQN), where the resulting state is fully Bell-diagonal with a single parameter, we prove that the AQN produces a block-diagonal state in the Bell basis with four parameters. We develop a method for the simulation of AQN, where we keep track of these four parameters of each entangled link, along with the number of times noise acts on it, i.e., its age, until it is consumed for swapping. Our results reveal that across diverse policies, including NESTING and SWAP-ASAP, AQN consistently outperforms TAQN in terms of both fidelity and average entanglement. The benefit is most significant in the low-probability regime of elementary link generation, highly relevant for near-term experiments. Notably, we also identify the coherence-time and link-probability regions where TAQN fails while AQN succeeds in distributing end-to-end entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Similarity as Thermodynamic Work: Between Depth and Diversity -- from Information Distance to Ugly Duckling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kentaro Imafuku</p>
            <p>Defining similarity is a fundamental challenge in information science. Watanabe's Ugly Duckling Theorem highlights diversity, while algorithmic information theory emphasizes depth through Information Distance. We propose a statistical-mechanical framework that treats program length as energy, with a temperature parameter unifying these two aspects: in the low-temperature limit, similarity approaches Information Distance; in the high-temperature limit, it recovers the indiscriminability of the Ugly Duckling theorem; and at the critical point, it coincides with the Solomonoff prior. We refine the statistical-mechanical framework by introducing regular universal machines and effective degeneracy ratios, allowing us to separate redundant from core diversity. This refinement yields new tools for analyzing similarity and opens perspectives for information distance, model selection, and non-equilibrium extensions.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry for Higher and Noninvertible Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Benini, Pasquale Calabrese, Michele Fossati, Amartya Harsh Singh, Marco Venuti</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous excitation of a centripetally accelerated atom coupled to electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the rate of change of the mean atomic energy for centripetally accelerated atoms interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary, using the Dalibard-Dupont-Roc-Cohen-Tannoudji formalism. The distinct contributions from vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction are analyzed separately. Our results reveal that, when the centripetal acceleration significantly exceeds the characteristic acceleration set by the atomic transition frequency, vacuum fluctuations dominates over radiation reaction, irrespective of the atom-boundary distance and the atomic polarization. In the near-zone regime, where the atom-boundary distance is much smaller than both the characteristic length associated with the acceleration and the transition wavelength of the atom, the boundary introduces substantial corrections to the rate of change of the mean atomic energy. These corrections are comparable in magnitude to those in free space and exhibit strong dependence on the atomic polarization. Remarkably, in the intermediate and far regions, contributions stemming from the combined effects of the boundary and acceleration can become the leading and subleading terms, respectively. An acceleration-independent term also arises from their interplay. These findings highlight the significant interplay between acceleration and the presence of a boundary in shaping atomic radiative properties and may have potential implications for experimentally probing the circular Unruh effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. J. Morelock, S. Bagchi, E. L. Briggs, W. Lu, J. Bernholc, P. Ganesh</p>
            <p>Computational materials science has evolved toward materials informatics, where large datasets of complex, multispecies compounds are generated and evaluated using density functional theory (DFT). Materials genome projects mine these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells. Our results link strain and twist angle to material informatics properties, including stability and band gap, and show that pyRMG can initialize and converge challenging RMG-based workflows with limited user intervention.</p>

            <h2>Sublinear Time Quantum Sensitivity Sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Song, David P. Woodruff, Lichen Zhang</p>
            <p>We present a unified framework for quantum sensitivity sampling, extending the advantages of quantum computing to a broad class of classical approximation problems. Our unified framework provides a streamlined approach for constructing coresets and offers significant runtime improvements in applications such as clustering, regression, and low-rank approximation. Our contributions include: * $k$-median and $k$-means clustering: For $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, we give an algorithm that constructs an $\epsilon$-coreset in time $\widetilde O(n^{0.5}dk^{2.5}~\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering. Our approach achieves a better dependence on $d$ and constructs smaller coresets that only consist of points in the dataset, compared to recent results of [Xue, Chen, Li and Jiang, ICML'23]. * $\ell_p$ regression: For $\ell_p$ regression problems, we construct an $\epsilon$-coreset of size $\widetilde O_p(d^{\max\{1, p/2\}}\epsilon^{-2})$ in time $\widetilde O_p(n^{0.5}d^{\max\{0.5, p/4\}+1}(\epsilon^{-3}+d^{0.5}))$, improving upon the prior best quantum sampling approach of [Apers and Gribling, QIP'24] for all $p\in (0, 2)\cup (2, 22]$, including the widely studied least absolute deviation regression ($\ell_1$ regression). * Low-rank approximation with Frobenius norm error: We introduce the first quantum sublinear-time algorithm for low-rank approximation that does not rely on data-dependent parameters, and runs in $\widetilde O(nd^{0.5}k^{0.5}\epsilon^{-1})$ time. Additionally, we present quantum sublinear algorithms for kernel low-rank approximation and tensor low-rank approximation, broadening the range of achievable sublinear time algorithms in randomized numerical linear algebra.</p>
