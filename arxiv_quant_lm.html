            <h2>Error and Resource Estimates of Variational Quantum Algorithms for Solving Differential Equations Based on Runge-Kutta Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Dechant, Liubov Markovich, Vedran Dunjko, Jordi Tura</p>
            <p>A focus of recent research in quantum computing has been on developing quantum algorithms for differential equations solving using variational methods on near-term quantum devices. A promising approach involves variational algorithms, which combine classical Runge-Kutta methods with quantum computations. However, a rigorous error analysis, essential for assessing real-world feasibility, has so far been lacking. In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of error sources and determine the resource requirements needed to achieve specific target errors. In particular, we derive analytical error and resource estimates for scenarios with and without shot noise, examining shot noise in quantum measurements and truncation errors in Runge-Kutta methods. Our analysis does not take into account representation errors and hardware noise, as these are specific to the instance and the used device. We evaluate the implications of our results by applying them to two scenarios: classically solving a $1$D ordinary differential equation and solving an option pricing linear partial differential equation with the variational algorithm, showing that the most resource-efficient methods are of order 4 and 2, respectively. This work provides a framework for optimizing quantum resources when applying Runge-Kutta methods, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy in both solving differential equations and simulating quantum systems. Further, this work plays a crucial role in assessing the suitability of these variational algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The results may also be of interest to the numerical analysis community as they involve the accumulation of errors in the function description, a topic that has hardly been explored even in the context of classical differential equation solvers.</p>

            <h2>Coherent information as a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Luis Colmenarez, Markus Müller, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry protected fermion matter.</p>

            <h2>Selective and noise-resilient wave estimation with quantum sensor networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arne Hamann, Paul Aigner, Pavel Sekatski, Wolfgang Dür</p>
            <p>We consider the selective sensing of planar waves in the presence of noise. We present different methods to control the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network, which allow one to decouple it from arbitrarily selected waves while retaining sensitivity to the signal. Comparing these methods with classical (non-entangled) sensor networks we demonstrate two advantages. First, entanglement increases precision by enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Second, entanglement enables the elimination of correlated noise processes corresponding to waves with different propagation directions, by exploiting decoherence-free subspaces. We then provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of the advantage offered by entangled quantum sensor networks, which is not specific to waves and can be of general interest. We demonstrate an exponential advantage in the regime where the number of sensor locations is comparable to the number of noise sources. Finally, we outline a generalization to other waveforms, e.g., spherical harmonics and general time-dependent fields.</p>

            <h2>Coherent enhancement of collection of light from linear ion crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. D. Tran, D. Babjak, A. Kovalenko, K. Singh, M. T. Pham, P. Obšil, A. Lešundák, O. Číp, L. Slodička</p>
            <p>The efficient detection of light from trapped ions in free space is paramount for most of their applications. We propose a scheme to enhance the photon collection from linear ion strings. It employs the constructive interference of light scattered from ions along the axial direction in linear Paul traps. The coherent enhancement of photon collection is numerically optimized for a range of feasible spatial angles and realistic ion positions in a single harmonic Coulomb potential. Despite the large mutual distance of scatterers on the order of many wavelengths of scattered light, presented experimental tests confirm the feasibility of enhancements by a factor of $3.05 \pm 0.09$ with a crystal of nine $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Further significant improvements using different ion species, which allow for suppression of the sensitivity to the residual thermal motion, are predicted. The proposed collection geometry is intrinsic to diverse linear ion trap designs and the methodology can be directly applied to an observation of scattering from ion crystals prepared in collective electronic excitations.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Pumping of Spectral Holes in a Tm$^{3+}$: YAG Crystal for Broadband Quantum Optical Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yisheng Lei, Zongfeng Li, Mahdi Hosseini</p>
            <p>Quantum memory devices with high storage efficiency and bandwidth are essential elements for future quantum networks. Here, we report a storage efficiency greater than 28% in a Tm$^{3+}$: YAG crystal in elevated temperatures and without compromising the memory bandwidth. Using various pumping and optimization techniques, we demonstrate multi-frequency window storage with a high memory bandwidth of 630 MHz. Moreover, we propose a general method for large-bandwidth atomic-frequency memory with non-Kramers rare-earth-ion (REI) in solids enabling significantly higher storage efficiency and bandwidth.

            <h2>Polynomially efficient quantum enabled variational Monte Carlo for training neural-network quantum states for physico-chemical applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manas Sajjan, Vinit Singh, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ansätze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Perturbation theory scope for predicting vibronic selectivity by entangled two photon absorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. D. Rodriguez-Camargo, H. O. Gestsson, C. Nation, A. R. Jones, A. Olaya-Castro</p>
            <p>Using second-order perturbation theory in the light-matter interaction, we derive an analytical approximation for the vibronic populations of a diatomic system excited by ultrabroadband frequency entangled photons and evaluate the population dynamics for different degrees of entanglement between photon pairs. Our analytical approach make the same predictions as previously derived via numerical solutions of the complete Schrödinger equation [H. Oka, Physical Review A 97, 063859 (2018)], with the added advantage of providing clear physical insights into the vibronic selectivity as a function of the degree of photon correlations while requiring significantly reduced computational effort. Specifically, our analytical expression for the probability of vibronic excitation includes a factor which predicts the enhancement of vibrational selectivity as a function of the degree correlation between the entangled photon pairs, the targeted vibrational energy level, and the vibrational molecular structure encoded in the Franck-Condon factors. Our results illustrate the importance of going beyond the usual approximations in second-order perturbation theory to capture the relevance of the vibrational structure of the molecular system of interest in order to gain a deeper understanding of the possible quantum-enhancement provided by the interaction between quantum light and matter.</p>

            <h2>Completely characterizing multimode nonlinear-optical quantum processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geunhee Gwak, Chan Roh, Young-Do Yoon, M.S. Kim, Young-Sik Ra</p>
            <p>Complete characterization of a multimode optical process has paved the way for understanding complex optical phenomena, leading to the development of novel optical technologies. Until now, however, characterizations have mainly focused on a linear-optical process, despite the plethora of multimode nonlinear-optical processes crucial for photonic technologies. Here we report the experimental characterization of multimode nonlinear-optical quantum processes by obtaining the full information needed to describe them while satisfying the necessary physical condition. Specifically, to characterize a second-order nonlinear-optical process of parametric downconversion, we determine the amplification and noise matrices of multimode field quadratures. The full information allows us to factorize the multimode process, leading to the identification of eigenquadratures and their associated amplification and noise properties. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our method by characterizing various nonlinear-optical quantum processes, including cluster state generation, mode-dependent loss with nonlinear interaction, and a quantum noise channel. Our method, by providing a versatile technique for characterizing a nonlinear-optical process, will be beneficial for developing scalable photonic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Fully quantum stochastic entropy production</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ge Bai, Francesco Buscemi, Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>Building on the approach of stochastic thermodynamics, we define entropy production for arbitrary quantum processes, using Bayesian tools to capture the inherent subjective element. First, we show that the classical expression for average entropy production involves only comparisons of statistics at the input or output, and thus can be formally generalized by replacing probability distributions by quantum states. To go beyond the mere average, we construct an entropy production operator, that generalizes the value of entropy to the non-commutative case. The operator is Hermitian; its average is non-negative, so that the Second Law takes its usual form $\langle\Sigma\rangle\geq 0$; it formally satisfies the Jarzynski equality; and recovers the classical expression for classical processes. We also present features whose fully quantum version is not a straightforward translation of the classical one: these may point to the core difference between classical and quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast high-fidelity state readout of single neutral atom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Wang, Dong-Yu Huang, Xiao-Long Zhou, Ze-Min Shen, Si-Jian He, Qi-Yang Huang, Yi-Jia Liu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>The capability to measure the state of a quantum system is vital to a practical quantum network, for applications including distributed quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. As a thriving platform for quantum information technology, single neutral atoms suffer from low achievable photon scattering rate and shallow trapping potential, which limits the fidelity and speed of state readout process. Here, by coupling an single neutral atom with a high-finesse fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity (FFPC) in Purcell regime, we realize strong enhancement of the atomic photoemission rate, which enables ultrafast and high-fidelity discrimination of bright and dark hyperfine states of the atom. The readout fidelity can reach 99.1(2)% within 200 ns and 99.985(8)% within 9 $\mu$s. Furthermore, we demonstrate that state preparation via optical pumping can be efficiently accelerated by real-time decision protocol based on ultrafast state readout. This work paves the way to the implementation of quantum networking protocols with high communication rate and high fidelity.</p>

            <h2>End-to-end switchless architecture for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Renault, Patrick Yard, Raphael C. Pooser, Miller Eaton, Hussain Asim Zaidi</p>
            <p>Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Equilibrium in All-Optical Single Quantum-Trajectory Ising Machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Tosca, Marcello Calvanese Strinati, Claudio Conti, Cristiano Ciuti</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of multi-mode optical systems driven by two-photon processes and subject to non-local losses, incorporating quantum noise at the Gaussian level. Our findings show that the statistics retrieved from a single Gaussian quantum trajectory exhibits emergent thermal equilibrium governed by an Ising Hamiltonian, encoded in the dissipative coupling between modes. The system's effective temperature is set by the driving strength relative to the oscillation threshold. Given the ultra-short time scales typical of all-optical devices, our study demonstrates that such multi-mode optical systems can operate as ultra-fast Boltzmann samplers, paving the way towards the realization of efficient hardware for combinatorial optimization, with promising applications in machine learning and beyond.</p>

            <h2>High quality quasinormal modes of phononic crystals for quantum acoustodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksey N. Bolgar, Shtefan V. Sanduleanu, Aleksandr Strelnikov, Oleg V. Astafiev</p>
            <p>Phononic crystals are a promising platform for the study of quantum acoustodynamics. In a recent experiment, the interaction of a superconducting quantum bit with modes of a phononic crystal has been demonstrated. The field of these modes is localized in a compact area, providing high values of the coupling constant with the qubit. However, the Q-factor of phononic crystal modes is strongly limited (1050) due to a phonon emission from the crystal ends. For further use of phononic crystals in research in the field of quantum acoustodynamics, it is desirable to overcome this limitation in the quality factor. In this work, we have proposed a structure consisting of a phononic crystal placed between the Bragg mirrors. Our simulations predict that the Q-factor in such a structure can reach (100000). We demonstrate experimental results in which this structure has a Q-factor (60,000), which is 60 times higher than that of an acoustic crystal of the same size.</p>

            <h2>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiko Sekine, Ryo Murakami, Yoshiyasu Doi</p>
            <p>The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian delocalization in 1D via emergent compactness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang-Hong Mo, Zhenyu Xiao, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao</p>
            <p>Potential disorder in 1D leads to Anderson localization of the entire spectrum. Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the non-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for delocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely random potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal spatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the concomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn translates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized states can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Heralded Optical Entanglement Generation via the Graph Picture of Linear Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungbeom Chin, Marcin Karczewski, Yong-Su Kim</p>
            <p>Non-destructive heralded entanglement with photons is a valuable resource for quantum information processing. However, they generally entail ancillary particles and modes that amplify the circuit intricacy. To address this challenge, a recent work (\href{this https URL}{npj Quantum Information 10, 67 (2024)}) introduced a graph approach for creating multipartite entanglements with boson subtractions. Nonetheless, it remains an essential intermediate step toward practical heralded schemes: the proposition of heralded subtraction operators in bosonic linear quantum networks. This research establishes comprehensive translation rules from subtraction operators to linear optical operators, which provides a seamless path to design heralded schemes with single photons. Our method begets enhanced or previously unreported schemes for the $N$-partite GHZ state with $2N$ photons, $N$-partite W state with $2N+1$ photons and superposition of $N=3$ GHZ and W states with 9 photons. Our streamlined approach can straightforwardly design heralded schemes for multipartite entangled states by assembling the operators according to the guidence of sculpting bigraphs, hence significantly simplifies the quantum circuit design process.</p>

            <h2>Chirality-induced emergent spin-orbit coupling in topological atomic lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonah S. Peter, Stefan Ostermann, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling is of fundamental interest in both quantum optical and condensed matter systems alike. In this work, we show that optically induced electronic excitations in lattices of V-type atoms exhibit an emergent spin-orbit coupling when the geometry is chiral. This spin-orbit coupling arises naturally from the electric dipole interaction between the atomic sites and leads to a nontrivial topology for the lattice band structure. Using a general quantum optical model, we determine analytically the conditions that give rise to spin-orbit coupling and characterize the behavior under various symmetry transformations. We demonstrate that chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling can result from either the chirality of the underlying lattice geometry or the combination of an achiral lattice with a suitably chosen external quantization axis. We then discuss how these results are influenced by dissipation, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and illuminates the distinction between true and false chirality. Our results demonstrate that chiral atom arrays are a robust platform for realizing spin-orbit-coupled topological states of matter.</p>

            <h2>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Tian Li, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Huai-Bing Zhu, Simon Gröblacher, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum delocalization of a 1-milligram torsional pendulum for gravity experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofia Agafonova, Pere Rossello, Manuel Mekonnen, Onur Hosten</p>
            <p>Reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics has posed significant challenges in contemporary physics. Even the seemingly simple question of whether gravitational fields should obey the quantum superposition principle remains unanswered. Unlocking the answer experimentally necessitates a quantum-unfriendly regime with large masses and low-frequency dynamics to maximize the dimensionless figure-of-merit in the problem, quantifying the ability to generate quantum entanglement gravitationally. To this end, we develop a 1-milligram torsional pendulum operating at 18 Hz. Laser cooling its motion to an unprecedented 240~microkelvins for this mass range, we boost its quantum delocalization and benchmark a state-of-the-art quantum-gravity figure-of-merit with an unparalleled improvement potential. The results open a frontier for explorations of quantum aspects of gravity, establishing milligram-scale torsional pendulums as a leading platform.</p>

            <h2>Black Hole Multi-Entropy Curves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin, Mitsuhiro Nishida</p>
            <p>We investigate the multi-partite entanglement structure of an evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation by dividing the radiation into finer subsystems. Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</p>
