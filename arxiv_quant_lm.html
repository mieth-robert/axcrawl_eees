            <h2>Optimized Amplitude Amplification for Quantum State Preparation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artem Chernikov, Karina Zakharova, Sergey Sysoev</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present an algorithm for preparing quantum states of the form $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \alpha_i |i\rangle$, where the coefficients $\alpha_i$ are specified by a quantum oracle. Our method achieves this task twice as fast as the best existing algorithm known to the authors. Such state preparation is essential for quantum algorithms that process large classical inputs, including matrix inversion and linear system solvers. The standard approach relies on amplitude amplification, a process that may require multiple, time-consuming oracle queries. Consequently, reducing the number of queries - and thereby the overall time complexity can lead to significant performance improvements in practice.</p>

            <h2>Improved Ground State Estimation in Quantum Field Theories via Normalising Flow-Assisted Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal S. Ngairangbam, Michael Spannowsky, Timur Sypchenko</p>
            <p>We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States (NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space. This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</p>

            <h2>Single-photon emission modeling with statistical estimators for the exponential distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artur Czerwinski, Katarzyna Czerwinska, Xiangji Cai, Asad Ali, Hashir Kuniyil, Atta ur Rahman, Saif Al-Kuwari, Saeed Haddadi</p>
            <p>Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.</p>

            <h2>Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Aruku Senoo, Alexander Baumgärtner, Adam M. Kaufman, Hannes Pichler</p>
            <p>Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Multimode and Random-Access Optical Quantum Memory via Adiabatic Phase Imprinting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nasser Gohari Kamel, Sourabh Kumar, Ujjwal Gautam, Erhan Saglamyurek, Vahid Salari, Daniel Oblak</p>
            <p>A photonic quantum memory capable of simultaneously storing multiple qubits and subsequently recalling any randomly selected subset of the qubits, is essential for large-scale quantum networking and computing. Such functionality, akin to classical Random-Access Memory (RAM), has proven difficult to implement due to the absence of a versatile random-access mechanism and limited multimode capacity in existing quantum memory protocols. A potential path to developing the quantum analog to RAM is offered by photon-echo protocols in rare-earth ion-doped materials, such as Revival Of Silenced Echo. These can utilize optical rephasing pulses to selectively read-out frequency multiplexed photonic qubits within an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition. However, the conventional non-adiabatic nature of the rephasing pulses requires intense, short-duration pulses, impeding their fidelity and multimode capacity. To address these critical limitations, we introduce an alternate protocol that employs Rapid Adiabatic Passage (RAP) rephasing pulses, to realize quantum memory, which invokes phase-imprints to suppress undesirable echoes. Using the optical transitions of a $^{171}{\rm Yb}^{3+}$:${\rm Y}_2{\rm SiO}_5$ crystal, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of multiple intricate spectro-temporally photonic modes and achieve optical random access memory across eight distinct spectral modes. This protocol yields greatly enhanced mode-mapping versatility while substantially lowering the required rephasing pulse intensity, providing a more efficient and reliable approach for high-fidelity qubit storage and retrieval.</p>

            <h2>Fully Collective Superradiant Lasing with Vanishing Sensitivity to Cavity Length Vibrations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jarrod T. Reilly, Simon B. Jäger, John Cooper, Murray J. Holland</p>
            <p>To date, realization of a continuous-wave active atomic clock has been elusive primarily due to parasitic heating from spontaneous emission while repumping the atoms. Here, we propose a solution to this problem by replacing the random emission with coupling to an auxiliary cavity, making repumping a fully collective process. While it is known that collective two-level models do not possess a generic lasing threshold, we show this restriction is overcome with multi-level atoms since collective pumping and decay can be performed on distinct transitions. Using relevant atomic parameters, we find this system is capable of producing an $\mathcal{O}$(100 $\mu$Hz)-linewidth continuous-wave superradiant laser. Our principal result is the potential for an operating regime with cavity length vibration sensitivity below $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14} / g)$, including a locus of parameter values where it completely vanishes even at steady-state.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Usman</p>
            <p>The meteoric rise of artificial intelligence in recent years has seen machine learning methods become ubiquitous in modern science, technology, and industry. Concurrently, the emergence of programmable quantum computers, coupled with the expectation that large-scale fault-tolerant machines will follow in the near to medium-term future, has led to much speculation about the prospect of quantum machine learning (QML), namely machine learning (ML) solutions which take advantage of quantum properties to outperform their classical counterparts. Indeed, QML is widely considered as one of the front-running use cases for quantum computing. In recent years, research in QML has gained significant global momentum. In this chapter, we introduce the fundamentals of QML and provide a brief overview of the recent progress and future trends in the field of QML. We highlight key opportunities for achieving quantum advantage in ML tasks, as well as describe some open challenges currently facing the field of QML. Specifically in the context of cybersecurity, we introduce the potential for QML in defence and security-sensitive applications, where it has been predicted that the seamless integration of quantum computing into ML will herald the development of robust and reliable QML systems, resilient against sophisticated threats arising from data manipulation and poisoning.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical non-Hermitian systems: Fingerprints and pure dephasing induced protection effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanchen Ma, Hao Zhang, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems have shown promising potential for realizing quantum information tasks that lack counterparts in the Hermitian realm. Understanding the dynamical characteristics of non-Hermitian systems as reflected in information-theoretic quantities is essential for advancing their applications. Here we investigate dynamics of trace distance and concurrence, which quantify information flow and entanglement, respectively, in non-Hermitian qubit systems exhibiting either parity-time or anti-parity-time symmetry. We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies. We further investigate the fate of dynamical fingerprints under the impact of pure dephasing. Surprisingly, we find that pure dephasing can slow down the inherent relaxation of information flow and entanglement in non-Hermitian systems with unbroken anti-parity-time symmetry, suggesting a passive environment-assisted information protection in this class of non-Hermitian systems. Our findings enhance our understanding of dynamical non-Hermitian systems and have specific relevance to their information-oriented applications.</p>

            <h2>Physical-Layer Machine Learning with Multimode Interferometric Photon Counting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Jin Feng, Anthony J. Brady, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>The learning of the physical world relies on sensing and data post-processing. When the signals are weak, multi-dimensional and correlated, the performance of learning is often bottlenecked by the quality of sensors, calling for integrating quantum sensing into the learning of such physical-layer data. An example of such a learning scenario is the stochastic quadrature displacements of electromagnetic fields, modeling optomechanical force sensing, radiofrequency photonic sensing, microwave cavity weak signal sensing and other applications. We propose a unified protocol that combines machine learning with interferometric photon counting to reduce noise and reveal correlations. By applying variational quantum learning with multimode programmable quantum measurements, we enhance signal extraction. Our results show that multimode interferometric photon counting outperforms conventional homodyne detection proposed in prior works for tasks like principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-correlation analysis (CCA), even below vacuum noise levels. To further enhance the performance, We also integrate entanglement-enhanced modules, in the form of squeezed state distribution and anti-squeezing at detection, into the protocol. Combining the multimode interferometric photon counting and multipartite entanglement, the proposed protocol provides a powerful toolbox for learning weak signals.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanics via the Barnett effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinhao Jia, Yingru Li, Juan Huang, Mei Zhang</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the quantum coherence ans its nonreciprocity in a cavity magnomechanical (CMM) syetem, which consists of a rotating yittrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a microwave cavity. By adjusting the direction of the magnetic field, the frequency shift of a magnon mode can be tuned from positive to negative due to the Barnett effect. This effect leads to a significant difference in the system stability and is responsible for the nonreciprocal quantum coherence. We examine how the input power, magnomechanical and magnon-photon coupling rates, decay rates of both the cavity photon modes and the magnon modes influence the quantum coherence. Through careful tuning of system parameters, nearly perfect nonreciprocity can be achieved. Our results provide a controllable mechanism for direction-dependent quantum coherence, with potential applications in nonreciprocal quantum devices and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Ab Initio Polaritonic Chemistry on Diverse Quantum Computing Platforms: Qubit, Qudit, and Hybrid Qubit-Qumode Architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Even Chiari, Wafa Makhlouf, Lucie Pepe, Johanna Klein, Emiel Koridon, Johanna Klein, Bruno Senjean, Benjamin Lasorne, Saad Yalouz</p>
            <p>Trying to export ab initio polaritonic chemistry onto emerging quantum computers raises fundamental questions. A central one is how to efficiently represent both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom on the same platform, in order to develop computational strategies that can accurately capture strong electron-photon correlations at a reasonable cost for implementation on near-term hardware. Given the hybrid fermion-boson nature of polaritonic problem, one may legitimately ask: should we rely exclusively on conventional qubit-based platforms, or consider alternative computational paradigms? To explore this, we investigate in this work three strategies: qubit-based, qudit-based, and hybrid qubit-qumode approaches. For each platform, we design compact, physically motivated quantum circuit ansätze and integrate them within the state-averaged variational quantum eigensolver to compute multiple polaritonic eigenstates simultaneously. A key element of our approach is the development of compact electron-photon entangling circuits, tailored to the native capabilities and limitations of each hardware architecture. We benchmark all three strategies on a cavity-embedded H$_{2}$ molecule, reproducing characteristic phenomena such as light-induced avoided crossings. Our results show that each platform achieves comparable accuracy in predicting polaritonic eigen-energies and eigenstates. However, with respect to quantum resources required the hybrid qubit-qumode approach offers the most favorable tradeoff between resource efficiency and accuracy, followed closely by the qudit-based method. Both of which outperform the conventional qubit-based strategy. Our work presents a hardware-conscious comparison of quantum encoding strategies for polaritonic systems and highlights the potential of higher-dimensional quantum platforms to simulate complex light-matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic properties of the frustrated decorated Ising chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D.V. Laptiev, O.O. Krivchikov, Yu.V. Savin, V.V. Slavin</p>
            <p>Using the Kramers-Wannier transfer matrix method we studied several decorated Ising chains. The exact expressions for thermodynamic characteristics, including the ground state characteristics, were obtained. We considered a number of modeling chains with different signs and absolute values of exchange constants for the nearest- and the next-nearest neighbors. For these models we calculated the magnetization curves. The critical values of magnetic fields and corresponding magnetization plateau parameters were obtained. Analytic expressions for the ground state entropy were obtained for the chains with different interaction constants. The dependencies of the number of states with minimum energy (the degeneration of the ground state) as the function of the number of particles were found. It was shown that these dependencies are expressed in terms of well-known numerical sequences - Lucas numbers and Pell numbers, which, in the limit of a large number of particles, are proportional to the powers of the golden and silver sections. Therefore, the ground state entropy (per particle) of the systems under consideration can be described in terms of these sections and, therefore, is nonzero.</p>

            <h2>Inequality for von Neumann entropy change under measurement and dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Kobayashi</p>
            <p>We derive a universal inequality that provides a lower bound on the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy change in a quantum system subject to continuous measurement and dissipation. Our result clarifies how entropy production is fundamentally constrained by three distinct contributions: (i) the non-Hermitian structure of the dissipation operator, (ii) the standard variance associated with measurement-induced fluctuations, and (iii) a generalized quantum variance reflecting the noncommutativity between the measurement observable and the quantum state. This third term vanishes when the state and observable commute, and thus represents a purely quantum contribution arising from coherence disturbance and measurement backaction. The derived inequality generalizes classical information-thermodynamic relations, such as the Sagawa--Ueda inequality, to the quantum regime, providing a new perspective on the trade-offs between information acquisition, control, and entropy production in continuously monitored open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Multimode Bosonic State Tomography with Single-Shot Joint Parity Measurement of a Trapped Ion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Honggi Jeon, Jiyong Kang, Wonhyeong Choi, Kyunghye Kim, Jaehun You, Taehyun Kim</p>
            <p>The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of reconstructing the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasi-probability function and the density matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multi-mode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for reconstructing a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multi-mode Wigner quasi-probability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and show that the generated state is non-positive under partial transpose, confirming its entanglement. We further show that the single-shot joint parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By post-selecting the parity measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the extension of the bosonic state lifetime, effectively implementing an error mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be easily extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Dicke superradiance: Universal scaling of the peak emission rate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity for many spatially separated emitters remained challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Derived from exact numerics, we present an analytically compact and easily computable formula for the peak photon emission rate of fully excited quantum emitter systems undergoing superradiant decay. The result applies to emitter configurations in any geometry and reveals a universal behavior: spatially extended quantum systems have a geometry-dependent optimal emitter number and always reach a peak photon emission rate that increases only linearly with $N$. Our results encompass quantum systems ranging from cold atomic gases and neutral-atom arrays to molecular aggregates and solid-state materials.</p>

            <h2>Multiphoton blockade by multi-tone drive</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang-Yu Zhang, Zhi-Hao Liu, Jie-Qiao Liao, Xun-Wei Xu</p>
            <p>Multiphoton blockade provides an efficient way to achieve entangled photon sources and leads to wide applications in modern quantum technologies. Here, we propose a scheme to realize multiphoton blockade by a multi-tone drive. Specifically, we demonstrate two-photon and three-photon blockades in a single-mode optical Kerr resonator using a two-tone and a three-tone drive, respectively. In comparison with the single-tone drive, except for the blockade of the $(n+1)$th photon excitation due to large detuning, the key mechanism in this scheme is the sequently resonant excitations of all the $m$-photon states ($m\leq n$) by the $n$-tone drive, which lead to the enhancement of photon generation and the demonstration of multiphoton blockade in the weak driving regime. Moreover, the photon distribution within the system can be adjusted on demand by tuning the relative amplitudes of the driving fields for different frequencies. The scheme can be extended to other bosonic systems and be applied to demonstrate other multiphoton physical effects.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Protection and Thermal Fragility of Quantum Resources in a Spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg Diamond Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fadwa Benabdallah, M. Y. Abd-Rabbou, Mohammed Daoud</p>
            <p>This research investigates the dynamics of entanglement and uncertainty-induced nonlocality in a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain subjected to local non-Markovian decoherence channels. By examining amplitude damping and random telegraph noise in both zero and finite temperature regimes, the study reveals nuanced distinctions in the degradation and revival of quantum correlations. The interplay between intrinsic spin couplings, thermal effects, and memory-induced coherence backflow highlights the complex behavior of quantum resources under realistic noise conditions. Concurrence emerges as a sensitive marker of entanglement recovery in dephasing environments, while uncertainty-induced nonlocality proves more resilient in high-temperature or dissipative regimes. The analysis further demonstrates that moderate thermal activation and external magnetic fields can nontrivially enhance or suppress quantum features depending on system parameters. These findings offer a detailed perspective on the robustness and complementarity of different quantum correlation measures, providing guiding principles for the design of thermally stable and noise-resilient quantum information protocols.</p>

            <p>Many body localization shows the robustness for external perturbations and time reversal symmetry on Time Crystal. This Time Crystal prolongs the coherence time, hence, it is used for quantum computers as qubits.

As a consequence, we revealed that Quantum Time Crystal Computing lower the accuracy of Quantum Reservoir Computing and improved the accuracy of Quantum Neural Network and Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network.

            <h2>Distinguishing Quantum and Classical Gravity via Non-Stationary Test Mass Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjie Zhong, Yubao Liu, Yiqiu Ma</p>
            <p>Classical gravity theory predicts a state-dependent gravitational potential for a quantum test mass, leading to nonlinear Schrodinger-Newton (SN) state evolution that contrasts with quantum gravity. Testing the effect of SN evolution can provide evidence for distinguishing quantum gravity and classical gravity, which is challenging to realize in the stationary optomechanical systems as analyzed in previous works [Phys. Rev. D 107, 024004 (2023), Phys. Rev. D 111, 062004 (2025)]. This work is devoted to analyzing the possibility of capturing the signature of SN theory during the non-stationary evolution of the test mass under the optomechanical measurement, where the second-order moments of a test mass can exhibit a distinctive oscillatory behavior. We show that this feature manifest in the non-stationary noise spectrum of outgoing light as additional peaks structures, although resolving these structures in practical experiments requires a larger number of repetitive trials with our sampling parameters, which is cost-prohibitive. To address this issue, we further employ statistical inference methods to extract more comprehensive information, thereby reducing the required number of experimental repetitions. Through Mock-Data simulations, we demonstrate that only 10 experimental trials of 40 seconds each are sufficient to reduce the false alarm rate for distinguishing between the two models to below one percent.</p>

            <h2>Cascaded quantum time transfer breaking the no-cloning barrier with entanglement relay architecture</h2>

            <p>Quantum two-way time transfer (Q-TWTT) leveraging energy-time entangled biphotons has achieved sub-picosecond stability but faces fundamental distance limitations due to the no-cloning theorem's restriction on quantum amplification. To overcome this challenge, we propose a cascaded Q-TWTT architecture employing relay stations that generate and distribute new energy-time entangled biphotons after each transmission segment. Theoretical modeling reveals sublinear standard deviation growth (merely N increase for N equidistant segments), enabling preservation of sub-picosecond stability over extended distances. We experimentally validate this approach using a three-station cascaded configuration over 200 km fiber segments, demonstrating strong agreement with theory. Utilizing independent Rb clocks at end and relay stations with online frequency skew correction, we achieve time stabilities of 3.82 ps at 10 s and 0.39 ps at 5120 s. The consistency in long-term stability between cascaded and single-segment configurations confirms high-precision preservation across modular quantum networks. This work establishes a framework for long-distance quantum time transfer that surpasses the no-cloning barrier, providing a foundation for future quantum-network timing infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fidelity Estimation in the Resource Theory of Nonstabilizerness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiping Liu, Kun Wang, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum fidelity estimation is essential for benchmarking quantum states and processes on noisy quantum devices. While stabilizer operations form the foundation of fault-tolerant quantum computing, non-stabilizer resources further enable universal quantum computation through state injection. In this work, we propose several efficient fidelity estimation protocols for both quantum states and channels within the resource theory of nonstabilizerness, focusing on qudit systems with odd prime dimensions. Our protocols require measuring only a constant number of phase-space point operator expectation values, with operators selected randomly according to an importance weighting scheme tailored to the target state. Notably, we demonstrate that mathematically defined nonstabilizerness measures--such as Wigner rank and mana--quantify the sample complexity of the proposed protocols, thereby endowing them with a clear operational interpretation in the fidelity estimation task. This connection reveals a fundamental trade-off: while fidelity estimation for general quantum states and channels requires resources that scale exponentially with their nonstabilizerness, the task remains tractable for states and channels that admit efficient classical simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritam Roy, Subhankar Bera, A. S. Majumdar, Shiladitya Mal</p>
            <p>We propose a communication game in the sequential measurement scenario, involving a sender and two receivers with restricted collaboration among the latter parties. In the framework of the prepare-transform-measure scenario, we find a prominent quantum advantage in the receiver's decoding of the message originally encoded by the sender. We show that an optimal trade-off between the success probabilities of the two receivers enables self-testing of the sender's state preparation, the first receiver's instruments, and the measurement device of the second receiver. Our protocol enables a more robust certification of the unsharp measurement parameter of the first receiver compared to the protocol without collaboration among the receivers. We further generalize our game to higher-dimensional systems, revealing greater quantum advantage with an increase in dimensions.</p>

            <p>Higher-dimensional quantum systems (qudits) offer advantages in information encoding, error resilience, and compact gate implementations, and naturally arise in platforms such as superconducting and solid-state systems. However, realistic conditions such as non-Markovian noise, non-ideal pulses, and beyond rotating wave approximation (RWA) dynamics, pose significant challenges for controlling and characterizing qudits. In this work, we present a machine-learning-based graybox framework for the control and noise characterization of qudits with arbitrary dimension, extending recent methods developed for single-qubit systems. Additionally, we introduce a local analytic expansion that enables interpretable modelling of the noise dynamics, providing a structured and efficient way to simulate system behaviour and compare different noise models. This interpretability feature allows us to to understand the mechanisms underlying successful control strategies; and opens the way for developing methods for distinguishing noise sources with similar effects. We demonstrate high-fidelity implementations of both global unitary operations as well as two-level subspace gates. Our work establishes a foundation for scalable and interpretable quantum control techniques applicable to both NISQ devices and finite-dimensional quantum systems, enhancing the performance of next-generation quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Testing the quantum nature of gravity through interferometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubao Liu, Yanbei Chen, Kentaro Somiya, Yiqiu Ma</p>
            <p>We propose a Michelson-type interferometric protocol for testing the quantum nature of gravity through testing the phenomenology of semi-classical gravity theory, which predicts a state-dependent Schrodinger-Newton (SN) evolution of the test mass. The protocol's feature lies in utilizing the asymmetry of two interferometric arms induced by SN self-gravity to create cross-talk between the common and differential motion of the test masses. This cross-talk is imprinted as a clean binary signature in the correlation measurements of the interferometer's output light fields. Our results demonstrate that, when assisted by 10 dB squeezed input states, 3 hours of aggregated measurement data can provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to conclusively test the SN theory in 1 Kelvin environment. This shows the strong feasibility of using such interferometric protocols to test if gravity operates quantum-mechanically.</p>

            <p>Quantum neural networks have emerged as promising quantum machine learning models, leveraging the properties of quantum systems and classical optimization to solve complex problems in physics and beyond. However, previous studies have demonstrated inevitable trainability issues that severely limit their capabilities in the large-scale regime. In this work, we propose a quantum recurrent embedding neural network (QRENN) inspired by fast-track information pathways in ResNet and general quantum circuit architectures in quantum information theory. By employing dynamical Lie algebras, we provide a rigorous proof of the trainability of QRENN circuits, demonstrating that this deep quantum neural network can avoid barren plateaus. Notably, the general QRENN architecture resists classical simulation as it encompasses powerful quantum circuits such as QSP, QSVT, and DQC1, which are widely believed to be classically intractable. Building on this theoretical foundation, we apply our QRENN to accurately classify quantum Hamiltonians and detect symmetry-protected topological phases, demonstrating its applicability in quantum supervised learning. Our results highlight the power of recurrent data embedding in quantum neural networks and the potential for scalable quantum supervised learning in predicting physical properties and solving complex problems.</p>

            <p>The Rydberg blockade phenomenon is fundamental to quantum algorithms employing neutral atom devices. By preventing two neighboring atoms from being simultaneously excited, it facilitates the embedding of unit disk graphs. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Rydberg blockade and its behavior under various drive schemes. We introduce new metrics for graph embedding, specifically the correlation matrix and maximum independence violation, and apply them to facilitate the embedding of disk graphs, a parent class of the unit disk graph class. Furthermore, we address the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on embedded disk graphs and demonstrate that a local drive, informed by local blockade radii, outperforms the globally applied drive commonly used for solving the MIS problem in unit disk graphs.</p>

            <p>High-performance numerical methods are essential not only for advancing quantum many-body physics but also for enabling integration with emerging quantum computing platforms. We present a scalable and general-purpose parallel algorithm for quantum simulations based on or-represented quantum algebra (ORQA). This framework applies to arbitrary spin systems and naturally integrates with quantum circuit simulation in the Heisenberg picture, particularly relevant to recent large-scale experiments on superconducting qubit processors [Kim et al., Nature 618, 500 (2023)]. As a benchmark, we simulate the kicked Ising model on a 127-qubit heavy-hexagon lattice, tracking the time evolution of local magnetization using up to one trillion Pauli strings. Executed on the supercomputer Fugaku, our simulations exhibit strong scaling up to $2^{17}$ parallel processes with near-linear communication overhead. These results establish ORQA as a practical and high-performance tool for quantum many-body dynamics, and highlight its potential for integration into hybrid quantum-classical computational frameworks, complementing recent advances in tensor-network and surrogate simulation techniques.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Enhanced Simulated Annealing Using Rydberg Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seokho Jeong, Juyoung Park, Jaewook Ahn</p>
            <p>Quantum-classical hybrid algorithms offer a promising strategy for tackling computationally challenging problems, such as the maximum independent set (MIS) problem that plays a crucial role in areas like network design and data analysis. This study experimentally demonstrates that a Rydberg quantum-classical hybrid algorithm, termed as quantum-enhanced simulated annealing (QESA), provides a computational time advantage over standalone simulated annealing (SA), a classical heuristic optimization method. The performance of QESA is evaluated based on the approximation ratio and the Hamming distance, relative to the graph size. The analysis shows that QESA outperforms standalone SA by leveraging a warm-start input derived from two types of Rydberg atomic array experimental data: quench evolution (QE) (implemented on the Quera Aquila machine) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) (using the experimental dataset archieved in K. Kim et al., Scientific Data 11, 111 (2024). Based on these results, an estimate is provided for the maximum graph size that can be handled within a one-day computational time limit on a standard personal computer. These findings suggest that QESA has the potential to offer a computational advantage over classical methods for solving complex optimization problems efficiently.</p>

Despite their widespread use, a complete characterization of their physically realizable values has remained an outstanding challenge. In this work, we provide a rigorous determination of the numerical range of Bargmann invariants for quantum systems of arbitrary finite dimension. We demonstrate that any permissible value of these invariants can be achieved using either (i) pure states exhibiting circular Gram matrix symmetry or (ii) qubit states alone. These results establish fundamental limits on Bargmann invariants in quantum mechanics and provide a solid mathematical foundation for their diverse applications in quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Xue, Jacob P. Covey, Matthew Otten</p>
            <p>Quantum chemistry is a promising application of future quantum computers, but the requirements on qubit count and other resources suggest that modular computing architectures will be required. We introduce an implementation of a quantum chemistry algorithm that is distributed across several computational modules: the distributed unitary selective coupled cluster (dUSCC). We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\sim$20$\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be "free" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of "free" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermalization mechanism and the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastián Gómez, Ángel L. Corps, Armando Relaño</p>
            <p>We propose a generalization of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis accounting for the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases. It consists of two conditions that any system with a degenerate spectrum must fulfill in order to thermalize. The failure of each of them generates a different non-thermalizing scenario. One is due to the absence of chaos and may indicate that extra constants of motion are required to describe equilibrium states. The other one implies the existence of initial conditions evolving towards symmetry-breaking equilibrium states. If it spreads across an entire spectral region, then this region gives rise to a symmetry-breaking phase. We explore the applicability of this formalism by means of numerical experiments on a three-site Bose-Hubbard model with two non-commuting discrete symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement-minimized orbitals enable faster quantum simulation of molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhendong Li</p>
            <p>Quantum computation offers significant potential for accelerating the simulation of molecules and materials through algorithms such as quantum phase estimation (QPE). However, the expected speedup in ground-state energy estimation depends critically on the ability to efficiently prepare an initial state with high overlap with the true ground state. For strongly correlated molecules such as iron-sulfur clusters, this overlap is demonstrated to decay exponentially with system size. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm to find entanglement-minimized orbitals (EMOs) using spin-adapted matrix product states (MPS) with small bond dimensions. The EMO basis yields a more compact ground-state representation, significantly easing initial state preparation for challenging systems. Our algorithm improves initial state overlap by nearly an order of magnitude over prior orbital optimization approaches for an iron-sulfur cluster with four irons, and is scalable to larger systems with many unpaired electrons, including the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase with eight transition metal centers. For these systems, we achieve substantial enhancements on initial state overlap by factors of $O(10^2)$ and $O(10^5)$, respectively, compared to results obtained using localized orbitals. Our results show that initial state preparation for these challenging systems requires far fewer resources than prior estimates suggested.</p>

            <h2>Exact Quantum Capacity of Decohering Channels in Arbitrary Dimensions</h2>

Unlike previous studies restricted to qubit systems or asymptotic bounds, our result holds for arbitrary finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We show that these channels are degradable for all $x$, leading to a closed-form, single-letter capacity formula that does not require regularization. Besides full decoherence, we extend our analysis to block-decohering channels, where decoherence occurs within orthogonal or overlapping subspaces. This family interpolates between identity channels and classical-quantum channels. Our findings clarify the role of coherence in quantum communication and provide rare exact benchmarks in the study of quantum channel capacities.</p>

Concurrently, oscillators with masses ranging between milligrams and grams in cavity optomechanical systems sparked interest for probing gravity, and even investigating gravity within macroscopic quantum systems. Here we present a measurement scheme for probing gravity in a microwave optomechanical setup that incorporates periodic gravitational modulation between the test mass and the driven source mass at the milligram scale. Optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) can be utilized to sense the gravitational interactions between test masses and source masses. Specifically, the relative variation in the height of the OMIT peak, expressed as $|1 + re^{i\phi}|^2 - 1$, where $r$ represents the ratio of the amplitude of the gravitational driving force to the radiation pressure force of the probe tone, and $\phi$ denotes their phase difference, can reach up to 2.3\% under plausible experimental conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da Zhang, Yu Zhang, Juan Gao</p>
            <p>We theoretically demonstrate via numerical modeling that fully degenerate triple-photon states generated by three-mode spontaneous parametric down-conversion can be categorized into four distinct states: 0-phase, $\pi$/2-phase, $\pi$-phase, and 3$\pi$/2-phase squeezed states. Using quantum relative entropy and Wigner negativity as quantitative measures, we show that the nonGaussianity and nonclassicality of these squeezed states increase with the increase of interaction strength. Analogous to Gaussian scenarios, these squeezed states serve as basic building blocks for deterministic preparation of two-mode non-Gaussian states. We study the correlation properties of two-mode state generated by interfering 0-phase and $\pi$-phase squeezed states on a beam splitter, and reveal its entanglement at 3rd and 6th-order moments using the positive partial transposition criterion based on higher-order covariance matrices. In particular, by adjusting the intensities of the two input beams, the entanglement of the two output modes at the 3rd- and 6th-order moments can be dynamically modulated. Our results highlight the nonclassical nature of fully degenerate triple-photon states and establish a pathway for preparing non-Gaussian entanglement based on such states.</p>

            <p>Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.</p>

            <p>Accurate computation of multiple eigenvalues of quantum Hamiltonians is essential in quantum chemistry, materials science, and molecular spectroscopy. Estimating excited-state energies is challenging for classical algorithms due to exponential scaling with system size, posing an even harder problem than ground-state calculations. We present a quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues and singular values of parameterized matrix families, including solving generalized eigenvalue problems that frequently arise in quantum simulations. Our method uses quantum amplitude amplification and phase estimation to identify matrix eigenvalues by locating minima in the singular value spectrum. We demonstrate our algorithm by proposing a quantum-computing formulation of the pseudospectral collocation method for the Schrödinger equation. We estimate fault-tolerant quantum resource requirements for the quantum collocation method, showing favorable scaling in the size of the problem $N$ (up to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N})$) compared to classical implementations with $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, for certain well-behaved potentials. Additionally, unlike the standard collocation method, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem requiring matrix inversion, our algorithm circumvents the associated numerical instability by scanning a parameterized matrix family and detecting eigenvalues through singular value minimization. This approach is particularly effective when multiple eigenvalues are needed or when the generalized eigenvalue problem involves a high condition number. In the fault-tolerant era, our method may thus be useful for simulating high-dimensional molecular systems with dense spectra involving highly excited states, such as those encountered in molecular photodynamics or quasi-continuum regimes in many-body and solid-state systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs), as currently formulated, are near-term quantum machine learning architectures that leverage parameterized quantum circuits with the aim of improving upon the performance of their classical counterparts. In this work, we show that some desired properties attributed to these models can be efficiently reproduced without necessarily resorting to quantum hardware. We indeed study the expressibility of parametrized quantum circuit commonly used in QNN applications and contrast it to those of two classes of states that can be efficiently simulated classically: matrix-product states (MPS), and Clifford-enhanced MPS (CMPS), obtained by applying a set of Clifford gates to MPS. In addition to expressibility, we assess the level of primary quantum resources, entanglement and non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. "magic"), in random ensembles of such quantum states, tracking their convergence to the Haar distribution. While MPS require a large number of parameters to reproduce an arbitrary quantum state, we find that CMPS approach the Haar distribution more rapidly, in terms of both entanglement and magic. Our results indicate that high expressibility in QNNs is attainable with purely classical resources.</p>

            <p>We introduce a construction for protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computing based on code concatenation and transversal gates. These protocols can be interpreted as families of quantum circuits of low-weight stabilizer measurements without strict locality constraints, effectively implementing concatenated codes. However, we primarily study these protocols in the context of photonic fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC), where they yield families of fusion networks with constant-sized resource states. Their high erasure thresholds relative to their resource-state cost establish them as promising candidates to replace surface codes in the context of FBQC. Examples include protocol families using 8-, 10- and 12-qubit resource states, with erasure thresholds of 13.8%, 19.1% and 11.5%, and footprint-per-logical-qubit scaling as $\mathcal{O}(d)$, $\mathcal{O}(d^{1.46})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{0.58})$, respectively, where $d$ is the code distance. We also present techniques for performing logical operations, decoding, and implementing the protocols in photonic hardware.

            <p>Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits as well as enhanced GHZ state fidelities in analog preparation. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable (CV) systems have shown remarkable potential for quantum computation, particularly excelling in scalability and error correction through bosonic encoding. Within this framework, the foundational notion of computational universality was introduced in [Phys. Rev.

However, achieving the critical objective of fault-tolerant computation requires some form of encoding, and to date there has been no proof that these universal CV gates can lead to encoded fault tolerance. We present compelling evidence in this direction by utilizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. Specifically, we numerically optimize the generation of GKP states from vacua using circuits comprised solely of universal CV gates. We demonstrate that these states can be attained with sufficient quality to exhibit error probabilities lower than the threshold needed to achieve a fault-tolerant memory via concatenated GKP-stabilizer codes.</p>

            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging erasure errors in logical qubits with metastable $^{171}$Yb atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bichen Zhang, Genyue Liu, Guillaume Bornet, Sebastian P. Horvath, Pai Peng, Shuo Ma, Shilin Huang, Shruti Puri, Jeff D. Thompson</p>
            <p>Implementing large-scale quantum algorithms with practical advantage will require fault-tolerance achieved through quantum error correction, but the associated overhead is a significant cost. The overhead can be reduced by engineering physical qubits with fewer errors, and by shaping the residual errors to be more easily correctable. In this work, we demonstrate quantum error correcting codes and logical qubit circuits in a metastable ${}^{171}$Yb qubit with a noise bias towards erasure errors, that is, errors whose location can be detected separate from any syndrome information. We show that dephasing errors on the nuclear spin qubit during coherent transport can be strongly suppressed, and implement robust entangling gates that maintain a high fidelity in the presence of gate beam inhomogeneity or pointing error. We demonstrate logical qubit encoding in the $[[4,2,2]]$ code, with error correction during decoding based on mid-circuit erasure measurements despite the fact that the code is too small to correct any Pauli errors. Finally, we demonstrate logical qubit teleportation between multiple code blocks with conditionally selected ancillas based on mid-circuit erasure checks, which is a key ingredient for leakage-robust error correction with neutral atoms.</p>

            <h2>Numerical Derivatives, Projection Coefficients, and Truncation Errors in Analytic Hilbert Space With Gaussian Measure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. W. AlMasri</p>
            <p>We introduce the projection coefficients algorithm, a novel method for determining the leading terms of the Taylor series expansion of a given holomorphic function from a graph perspective, while also analyzing the associated truncation errors. Let $ f(z) $ be a holomorphic function, and let $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denote the inner product defined over an analytic Hilbert space equipped with a Gaussian measure. The derivatives $ f^{(n)}(z) $ at a point $ z_0 $ can be computed theoretically by evaluating an inner product of the form $ f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{\langle z^n, f(z) \rangle}{C}, $ where $ C $ is a normalization constant. Specifically, in the Bargmann space (the analytic Hilbert space with a Gaussian weight and orthogonal monomials), this constant is $ \pi $. This result assumes that $ f(z) $ is a holomorphic function of a single complex variable. The accuracy of the computed derivative values depends on the precision and reliability of the numerical routines used to evaluate these inner products. The projection coefficients offer valuable insights into certain properties of analytic functions, such as whether they are odd or even, and whether the $ n $-th derivatives exist at a given point $ z_0 $. Due to its relevance to quantum theory, our approach establishes a correspondence between quantum circuits derived from quantum systems and the theory of analytic functions. This study lays the groundwork for further applications in numerical analysis and approximation theory within Hilbert spaces equipped with Gaussian measures. Additionally, it holds potential for advancing fields such as quantum computing, reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods -- which are widely used in support vector machines (SVM) and other areas of machine learning -- and probabilistic numerics.</p>

            <p>We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of quantum matter interacting with time-energy entangled photons. We consider the stimulation of a collective mode of a two-dimensional material by means of one of the two partners of a time-energy entangled pair of photons. Using an exactly solvable model, we analyze the out-of-equilibrium properties of both light and matter degrees of freedom, and show how entanglement in the incident photons deeply modifies relevant time scales of the light-matter interaction process. We find that entanglement strongly suppresses the delay between the transmission and absorption events, which become synchronous in the limit of strongly entangled wave packets. By comparing numerical simulations with analytic modeling, we trace back this behavior to the representation of entangled wave packets in terms of a superposition of multiple train pulses containing an increasing number of ultrashort non-entangled packets. As a result, we show that the entangled driving allows the creation of a matter excitation on a time scale shorter than the temporal width of the pulse. Eventually, by analyzing temporal correlations of the excited matter degrees of freedom, we show that driving with entangled photons imprints characteristic temporal correlations of time-energy entangled modes in the matter degree of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. J. Lobo, M. Rivera-Tapia, G. Rubilar, O. Jiménez, A. Delgado</p>
            <p>We study the possibility of discriminating between metric theories within the Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism. In this approach, the two-dimensional quantum state of a massive quantum clock becomes, after propagating at low speed and in a weak gravitational field, a function of the post-Newtonian parameters and thus a signature of a metric theory. To discriminate among metric theories, we resort to quantum-state discrimination strategies such as minimum error and unambiguous state discrimination. In particular, we show that it is possible to refute the hypothesis that a particular metric theory describes spacetime with a single detection event and that it is possible to discriminate with certainty between two different metrics, also with a single detection event. In general, the success probability of the discrimination strategy is a harmonic function of the product of the difference of the proper time corresponding to each quantum clock state, the energy difference between the energy eigenstates of the quantum clock, the propagation length, and speed. It is thus possible to find suitable length and speed scales such that the success probability is close to one by selecting a quantum system with the highest energy difference and the largest natural lifetime. According to this, atomic nuclei such as thorium are considered the most suitable quantum clocks.</p>

            <p>Precise measurement of the particle number, spatial distribution and internal state is fundamental to all proposed experiments with ultracold molecules both in bulk gases and optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate in-situ detection of individual molecules in a bulk sample of 87Rb133Cs molecules. Extending techniques from atomic quantum gas microscopy, we pin the molecules in a deep two-dimensional optical lattice and, following dissociation, collect fluorescence from the constituent atoms using a high-numerical-aperture objective. This enables detection of individual molecules up to the resolution of the sub-micron lattice spacing. Our approach provides direct access to the density distribution of small samples of molecules, allowing us to obtain precise measurements of density-dependent collisional losses. Further, by mapping two internal states of the molecule to different atomic species, we demonstrate simultaneous detection of the position and rotational state of individual molecules. Finally, we implement local addressing of the sample using a focused beam to induce a spatially-dependent light shift on the rotational transitions of the molecules.</p>

            <h2>Learning Best Paths in Quantum Networks</h2>

            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) transmit delicate quantum information across noisy quantum channels. Crucial applications, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and distributed quantum computation (DQC), rely on efficient quantum information transmission. Learning the best path between a pair of end nodes in a QN is key to enhancing such applications. This paper addresses learning the best path in a QN in the online learning setting. We explore two types of feedback: "link-level" and "path-level". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path, BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high probability, determine the best path. Finally, we perform NetSquid-based simulations and validate that both algorithms accurately and efficiently identify the best path.</p>

            <h2>Defect-Mediated Pairing and Dissociation of Strongly Correlated Electrons in Low Dimensional Lattices: The Quantum Taxi Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Pouthier, Saad Yalouz</p>
            <p>We study the quantum dynamics of a strongly correlated electron pair in a one-dimensional lattice, focusing on the occurrence of local dissociation/pairing mechanisms induced by a site energy defect. To this end, we simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size chain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb repulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with single-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with amplitude $ \Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially paired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such mechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \sim V \sim \Delta) \gg J$. To rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the original Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a two-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the pairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct families of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially well-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states with locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these states hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated electrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect. These results provide new insights into exotic pairing phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems and may have implications for the design of tunable many-body states in low-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.</p>

            <p>Relativistic quantum metrology provides a framework within which we can quantify the quality of measurement and estimation procedures while accounting for both quantum and relativistic effects. The chief measure for describing such procedures is the Fisher information, which quantifies how sensitive a given estimation is to a variance of some underlying parameter. Recently, the Fisher information has been used to quantify the spacetime information accessible to two-level quantum particle detectors. We have previously shown that such a system is capable of discerning black hole mass for static black holes in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we extend these results to the astrophysically interesting case of rotating black holes and show that the Fisher information is also sensitive to the rotation of a black hole.</p>

            <p>We reanalyze from a modern perspective the bold idea of G. Helm, W. Ostwald, P. Duhem and others that energy is the fundamental entity composing the physical world. We start from a broad perspective reminding the search for a fundamental ``substance'' (perhaps better referred to as ous\'ıa, the original Greek word) from the pre-Socratics to the important debate between Ostwald and Boltzmann about the energy vs. atoms at the end of the 19th century. While atoms were eventually accepted (even by Ostwald himself), the emergence of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity were crucial to suggest that the dismissal of energy in favor of atoms was perhaps premature, and should be revisited. We discuss how the so-called primitive ontology programme can be implemented with energy as the fundamental entity, and why fields (and their quanta, particles) should rather be considered as non-fundamental. We sketch some of the difficulties introduced by the attempt to include gravitation in the general scheme.</p>

Compared to hadron colliders, the EIC provides a cleaner experimental environment for measuring entanglement through the $\gamma^\ast g \to q\bar{q}$ channel, offering a strong signal and a promising avenue to verify Bell nonlocality.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. E. Alon, L. S. Cederbaum</p>
            <p>We consider a multiple-species mixture of interacting bosons, $N_1$ bosons of mass $m_1$, $N_2$ bosons of mass $m_2$, and $N_3$ bosons of mass $m_3$ in a harmonic trap of frequency $\omega$. The corresponding intraspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{11}$, $\lambda_{22}$, and $\lambda_{33}$, and the interspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{12}$, $\lambda_{13}$, and $\lambda_{23}$. When the shape of all interactions are harmonic, this is the generic multiple-species harmonic-interaction model which is exactly solvable. We start by solving the many-particle Hamiltonian and concisely discussing the ground-state wavefunction and energy in explicit forms as functions of all parameters, the masses, numbers of particles, and the intraspecies and interspecies interaction strengths. We then move to compute explicitly the reduced one-particle density matrices for all the species and diagonalize them, thus generalizing the treatment in [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 161}, 184307 (2024)]. The respective eigenvalues determine the degree of fragmentation of each species. As applications, we focus on aspects that do not appear for the respective single-species and two-species systems. For instance, placing a mixture of two kinds of bosons in a bath made by a third kind, and controlling the fragmentation of the former by coupling to the latter. Another example exploits the possibility of different connectivities (i.e., which species interacts with which species) in the mixture, and demonstrates how the fragmentation of species $3$ can be manipulated by the interaction between species $1$ and species $2$, when species $3$ and $1$ do not interact with each other. We thereby highlight properties of fragmentation that only appear in the multiple-species mixture. Further applications are briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled quantum states characterized by anomalous edge behavior, a manifestation of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological phases. Moreover, the Li-Haldane conjecture posits that the entanglement spectrum exhibits the same anomaly as the physical edge spectrum, thereby serving as an entanglement-based fingerprint for identifying topological phases. In this work, we extend the entanglement-based diagnostic tools by demonstrating that the edge anomaly is manifested not only in the entanglement spectrum but also in the reduced density matrix itself, a phenomenon we refer to as the mixed state anomaly. Focusing on the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase, we show that this anomaly is subtly encoded in symmetry-twisted mixed states, leading to a topological contribution to the disorder parameter beyond the area law, as well as a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking type long-range order when time reversal symmetry is present.</p>

Here, we evaluate the ultimate performance limits of deep convolutional neural network models for image reconstruction, by comparing them against the standard quantum limit set by shot-noise and the Heisenberg limit on precision. We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized images for which we can calculate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound to determine the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given probe state. We find the mean-squared error of the model predictions reaches these bounds calculated for the parameters, across a variety of parameterized images. These results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can learn to become the optimal estimators allowed by the laws of physics, performing parameter estimation and image reconstruction at the ultimate possible limits of precision for the case of classical illumination of the object.</p>

            <p>In this note we consider lattice fermions on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with a gapped ground state and show how to apply the NEASS approach to linear response to derive the formula for the Hall conductance in terms of an expectation of a commutator of modified step functions. This formula is usually derived by a charge pumping argument going back to Laughlin. Here we show that it can also be obtained as the linear response coefficient of the microscopic current response to an adiabatic increase of the chemical potential on a half plane. We discuss the connection with the double commutator formula with modified position operators for the Hall conductivity derived in arXiv:2411.06967 as the linear response coefficient of the macroscopic current response to the adiabatic application of a constant electric field.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.</p>

            <h2>POPQC: Parallel Optimization for Quantum Circuits (Extended Version)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengyu Liu, Jatin Arora, Mingkuan Xu, Umut A. Acar</p>
            <p>Optimization of quantum programs or circuits is a fundamental problem in quantum computing and remains a major challenge. State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and even exponential, time. Recent work proposed a new approach that pursues a weaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural number $\Omega$, local optimality insists that each and every $\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the oracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls to the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to oracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential. In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of quantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set of fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a $\Omega$-deep circuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in rounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the segments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the invariant. For constant $\Omega$, we prove that the algorithm requires $O(n\lg{n})$ work and $O(r\lg{n})$ span, where $n$ is the circuit size and $r$ is the number of rounds. We prove that the optimized circuit returned by the algorithm is locally optimal in the sense that any $\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to the oracle.</p>

            <p>Representing real-time data as a sum of complex exponentials provides a compact form that enables both denoising and extrapolation. As a fully data-driven method, the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm is agnostic to the underlying physical equations, making it broadly applicable to various observables and experimental or numerical setups. In this work, we consider applications of the ESPRIT algorithm primarily to extend real-time dynamical data from simulations of quantum systems. We evaluate ESPRIT's performance in the presence of noise and compare it to other extrapolation methods. We demonstrate its ability to extract information from short-time dynamics to reliably predict long-time behavior and determine the minimum time interval required for accurate results. We discuss how this insight can be leveraged in numerical methods that propagate quantum systems in time, and show how ESPRIT can predict infinite-time values of dynamical observables, offering a purely data-driven approach to characterizing quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Improved Quantum Query Upper Bounds Based on Classical Decision Trees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjan Cornelissen, Nikhil S. Mande, Subhasree Patro</p>
            <p>Given a classical query algorithm as a decision tree, when does there exist a quantum query algorithm with a speed-up over the classical one? We provide a general construction based on the structure of the underlying decision tree, and prove that this can give us an up-to-quadratic quantum speed-up. In particular, we obtain a bounded-error quantum query algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{s})$ to compute a Boolean function (more generally, a relation) that can be computed by a classical (even randomized) decision tree of size $s$. Lin and Lin [ToC'16] and Beigi and Taghavi [Quantum'20] showed results of a similar flavor, and gave upper bounds in terms of a quantity which we call the "guessing complexity" of a decision tree. We identify that the guessing complexity of a decision tree equals its rank, a notion introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Inf. Comp.'89] in the context of learning theory. This answers a question posed by Lin and Lin, who asked whether the guessing complexity of a decision tree is related to any complexity-theoretic measure. We also show a polynomial separation between rank and randomized rank for the complete binary AND-OR tree. Beigi and Taghavi constructed span programs and dual adversary solutions for Boolean functions given classical decision trees computing them and an assignment of non-negative weights to its edges. We explore the effect of changing these weights on the resulting span program complexity and objective value of the dual adversary bound, and capture the best possible weighting scheme by an optimization program. We exhibit a solution to this program and argue its optimality from first principles. We also exhibit decision trees for which our bounds are asymptotically stronger than those of Lin and Lin, and Beigi and Taghavi. This answers a question of Beigi and Taghavi, who asked whether different weighting schemes could yield better upper bounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chris N. Self, Sofyan Iblisdir, Gavin K. Brennen, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis</p>
            <p>The evaluation of the Jones polynomial at roots of unity is a paradigmatic problem for quantum computers. In this work we present experimental results obtained from existing noisy quantum computers for special cases of this problem, where it is classically tractable. Our approach relies on the reduction of the problem of evaluating the Jones polynomial of a knot at lattice roots of unity to the problem of computing quantum amplitudes of qudit stabiliser circuits, which are classically efficiently simulatable. More specifically, we focus on evaluation at the fourth root of unity, which is a lattice root of unity, where the problem reduces to evaluating amplitudes of qubit stabiliser circuits. To estimate the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes up to additive error we use the Hadamard test, yielding non-Clifford circuits that nevertheless we can always efficiently compute the correct output of. Hence, we further argue that this setup defines a standard benchmark for near-term noisy quantum processors. Additionally, we study the benefit of performing quantum error mitigation with the method of zero noise extrapolation.</p>

            <p>We present superconducting quantum circuits which exhibit atomic energy spectrum and selection rules as ladder and lambda three-level configurations designed by means of genetic algorithms. These heuristic optimization techniques are employed for adapting the topology and the parameters of a set of electrical circuits to find the suitable architecture matching the required energy levels and relevant transition matrix elements. We analyze the performance of the optimizer on one-dimensional single- and multi-loop circuits to design ladder ($\Xi$) and lambda ($\Lambda$) three-level system with specific transition matrix elements. As expected, attaining both the required energy spectrum and the needed selection rules is challenging for single-loop circuits, but they can be accurately obtained even with just two loops. Additionally, we show that our multi-loop circuits are robust under random fluctuation in their circuital parameters, i.e. under eventual fabrication flaws. Developing an optimization algorithm for automatized circuit quantization opens an avenue to engineering superconducting circuits with specific symmetry to be used as modules within large-scale setups, which may allow us to mitigate the well-known current errors observed in the first generation of quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Betti Numbers Using Cohomology Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nhat A. Nghiem, Xianfeng David Gu, Tzu-Chieh Wei</p>
            <p>Topological data analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale data. An abstract simplicial complex, in principle, can be built from data points, and by using tools from homology, topological features could be identified. Given a simplex, an important feature is called the Betti numbers, which roughly count the number of `holes' in different dimensions. Calculating Betti numbers exactly can be $\#$P-hard, and approximating them can be NP-hard, which rules out the possibility of any generic efficient algorithms and unconditional exponential quantum speedup. Here, we explore the specific setting of a triangulated manifold. In contrast to most known methods to estimate Betti numbers, which rely on homology, we exploit the `dual' approach, namely, cohomology, combining the insight of the Hodge theory and de Rham cohomology. Our proposed algorithm can calculate its $r$-th normalized Betti number $\beta_r/|S_r|$ up to some additive error $\epsilon$ with running time $\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\log(|S_r^K| |S_{r+1}^K|)}{\epsilon^2} \log (\log |S_r^K|) \big( r\log |S_r^K| \big) \Big)$, where $|S_r|$ is the number of $r$-simplexes in the given complex. For the estimation of $r$-th Betti number $\beta_r$ to a chosen multiplicative accuracy $\epsilon'$, our algorithm has complexity $ \mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\log(|S_r^K| |S_{r+1}^K|)}{\epsilon'^2} \big( \frac{ \Gamma}{\beta_r}\big)^2 (\log |S_r^K|) \log \big( r\log |S_r^K| \big) \Big)$, where $\Gamma \leq |S_r^K|$ can be chosen. A detailed analysis is provided, showing that our cohomology framework can even perform exponentially faster than previous homology methods in several regimes. In particular, our method is most effective when $\beta_r \ll |S_r^K|$, which can offer more flexibility and practicability than existing quantum algorithms that achieve the best performance in the regime $\beta_r \approx |S_r^K|$.</p>

The QSL time includes an alternative function by which we derive three QSL times with particularly chosen functions. It indicates that two QSL times are exactly the ones presented in Ref. [1] and [2], respectively, and the third one can provide a unified QSL time for both open and closed systems. The three QSL times are attainable for any given initial state in the sense that there exists a dynamics driving the initial state to evolve along the geodesic. We numerically compare the tightness of the three QSL times, which typically promises a tighter QSL time if optimizing the alternative function.</p>

            <h2>On the Conditions for a Quantum Violent Relaxation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guido Giachetti, Nicolò Defenu</p>
            <p>In general, classical fully-connected systems are known to undergo violent relaxation. This phenomenon refers to the relaxation of observables to stationary, non-thermal, values on a finite timescale, despite their long-time dynamics being dominated by mean-field effects in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we analyze the ``quantum" violent relaxation by studying the dynamics of generic many-body systems with two-body, all-to-all, interactions in the thermodynamic limit. We show that, in order for violent relaxation to occur very specific conditions on the spectrum of the mean-field effective Hamiltonian have to be met. These conditions are hardly met and ``quantum" violent relaxation is observed rarely with respect to its classical counterpart. Our predictions are validated by the study of a spin model which, depending on the value of the coupling, shows a transition between violent-relaxation and a generic prethermal phase. We also analyze a spin version of the quantum Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model, which is shown not to exhibit violent-relaxation. Finally, we discuss how the violent-relaxation picture emerges back in the classical limit. Our results demonstrate how, even in the mean-field regime, quantum effects have a rather dramatic impact on the dynamics, paving the way to a better understanding of light-matter coupled systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of QHT, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on QHT, we characterize the sample complexity of binary QHT in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse type II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy, provided that the type II error probability is sufficiently small. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of QHT is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of QHT, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.</p>

            <p>We introduce Lindblad-like quantum tomography (L$\ell$QT) as a quantum characterization technique of time-correlated noise in quantum information processors. This approach enables the estimation of time-local master equations, including their possible negative decay rates, by maximizing a likelihood function subject to dynamical constraints. We discuss L$\ell$QT for the dephasing dynamics of single qubits in detail, which allows for a neat understanding of the importance of including multiple snapshots of the quantum evolution in the likelihood function, and how these need to be distributed in time depending on the noise characteristics. By a detailed comparative study employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, we assess the accuracy and precision of L$\ell$QT of a dephasing quantum dynamical map that goes beyond the Lindblad limit, focusing on two different microscopic noise models that can be realised in either trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit architectures. We explore the optimization of the distribution of measurement times to minimize the estimation errors, assessing the superiority of each learning scheme conditioned on the degree of non-Markovinity of the noise, and setting the stage for future experimental designs of non-Markovian quantum tomography.</p>

            <p>The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength atomic arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground-state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yokomizo, Yuto Ashida</p>
            <p>The competition between quantum many-particle dynamics and continuous monitoring can lead to measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). So far, MIPTs have been extensively explored in fermionic or spin systems. To examine the possibility of an MIPT in bosonic systems, we study the entanglement structure in continuously monitored free bosons with long-range couplings. When the measurement is local, we find that no MIPTs occur because the substantial entanglement generated by the long-range coupling overcomes the entanglement destruction due to the measurement. In contrast, we show that the nonlocal measurement can efficiently suppress the entanglement generation, leading to an MIPT where the bipartite entanglement entropy exhibits the subvolume-to-area law phase transition as the measurement strength is increased. Our numerical results indicate that the critical point should be described by a certain conformal field theory, while the transition does not belong to a conventional universality class such as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class.</p>

            <p>Work is a process-based quantity, and its measurement typically requires interaction with a measuring device multiple times. While classical systems allow for non-invasive and accurate measurements, quantum systems present unique challenges due to the influence of the measuring device on the final value of work. As recent studies have shown, among these challenges is the impossibility of formulating a universal definition of work that respects energy conservation for coherent quantum systems and is compatible with the Jarzynski equality - a fluctuation relation linking the equilibrium free energy difference to the non-equilibrium work. Here we overcome this challenge by introducing a genuinely quantum, positive correction to the Jarzynski equality stemming from imposing energy conservation. When sufficiently large, this correction forces quantum work to violate the second law more often. Moreover, we construct modified two-point measurement (TPM) schemes for work along with circuit implementations for them. These measurement schemes correctly certify energy conservation and remain consistent with our quantum-corrected fluctuation relation.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.</p>

Here, we present an ultrabright polarization-entangled photon source based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide designed for practical quantum communication networks. Using a 780 nm pump laser, the source achieves a pair generation rate of 2.4 $\times 10^{10}$ pairs/s/mW. Remarkably, the entangled photons are bright enough to be detected by a power meter, reaching a power of 17.9 nW under a pump power of 3.2 mW. We demonstrate the practicality of the source by conducting quantum key distribution experiments over long-distance fiber links. Wavelength-division multiplexing was employed to enhance the key generation, and nonlocal dispersion compensation was implemented to ensure precise timing coincidence measurements across a broad spectral range. By utilizing nine pairs of wavelength channels, the system achieved the applicable secure key rates of up to 440.80 bits/s over 200 km with a 62 dB loss and extended the maximum secure key generation distance to 404 km.

            <p>Quantum recursive programming has been recently introduced for describing sophisticated and complicated quantum algorithms in a compact and elegant way. However, implementation of quantum recursion involves intricate interplay between quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls. In this paper, we aim at resolving this fundamental challenge and develop a series of techniques to efficiently implement quantum recursive programs. Our main contributions include: 1. We propose a notion of quantum register machine, the first quantum architecture (including an instruction set) that provides instruction-level support for quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls at the same time. 2. Based on quantum register machine, we describe the first comprehensive implementation process of quantum recursive programs, including the compilation, the partial evaluation of quantum control flow, and the execution on the quantum register machine. 3. As a bonus, our efficient implementation of quantum recursive programs also offers automatic parallelisation of quantum algorithms. For implementing certain quantum algorithmic subroutine, like the widely used quantum multiplexor, we can even obtain exponential parallel speed-up (over the straightforward implementation) from this automatic parallelisation. This demonstrates that quantum recursive programming can be win-win for both modularity of programs and efficiency of their implementation.</p>

            <p>Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction in the Newtonian limit. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering the general relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</p>

In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Hong, Hao-Wei Cui, An-Chun Ji, Shi-Ju Ran</p>
            <p>Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrödinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.</p>

            <h2>Generalizing the matching decoder for the Chamon code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohar Schwartzman-Nowik, Benjamin J. Brown</p>
            <p>Different choices of quantum error-correcting codes can reduce the demands on the physical hardware needed to build a quantum computer. To achieve the full potential of a code, we must develop practical decoding algorithms that can correct errors that have occurred with high likelihood. Matching decoders are very good at correcting local errors while also demonstrating fast run times that can keep pace with physical quantum devices. We implement variations of a matching decoder for a three-dimensional, non-CSS, low-density parity check code known as the Chamon code, which has a non-trivial structure that does not lend itself readily to this type of decoding. The non-trivial structure of the syndrome of this code means that we can supplement the decoder with additional steps to improve the threshold error rate, below which the logical failure rate decreases with increasing code distance. We find that a generalized matching decoder that is augmented by a belief-propagation step prior to matching gives a threshold of 10.5% for depolarizing noise.</p>

            <h2>A Classical Analogue of Entanglement for a Kicked Top</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bilal Khalid, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>It is widely believed that quantum mechanics cannot exhibit chaos, since unitarity of time evolution ensures that distances between quantum states are preserved. However, a parallel argument can be constructed in classical mechanics that would seem to deny the existence of classical chaos too. The argument works by describing classical states as probability distributions in phase space and showing that the inner product between distributions on phase space is preserved under Liouvillian dynamics. Thus, the more faithful classical analogy of a quantum state is not a single phase space trajectory but is instead a phase space distribution, and chaos in such states must be identified by some statistical signatures instead of exponential separation of nearby states. The search for these signatures is the primary goal in quantum chaos research. However, this perspective also naturally motivates the search for classical analogues of these signatures, to reveal the inner machinery of chaos in quantum systems. One widely recognized signature of chaos in quantum systems is the dynamical generation of entanglement. Chaos in the classical system is correlated with a greater entanglement production in the corresponding quantum system. One of the most well-studied examples of this is the kicked top model. In this paper, we construct a classical analogue of bipartite entanglement in terms of the mutual information between phase space distributions of subsystems and find completely analogous signatures of chaos as those found in entanglement for the kicked top Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Pierre Gazeau, Tomoi Koide, Romain Murenzi, Aidan Zlotak</p>
            <p>We present an application of the affine covariant integral quantization (ACIQ) (this http URL, 5, 901, 2020, this http URL, 7.1, 2020) to quantum mechanics on the punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), which comprises translations, rotations, and dilations of the plane. Due to the topology of the punctured plane, our quantization procedure gives rise to an affine vector potential. This potential can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge field produced by an infinite solenoid. This observation supports a reinterpretation of the AB effect: it emerges from the topological constraint imposed by the impenetrable coil rather than from an externally applied classical gauge field. In addition to this gauge structure, ACIQ also generates a repulsive, centrifugal-like scalar potential, a feature already encountered when applying ACIQ to motion on the half-line, whose phase space is the open half-plane. These results provide a new perspective on the AB effect, highlighting the central roles of topology and symmetry in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>We analyze the interference of individual photons in a linear-optical setup comprised of two overlapping Mach-Zehnder interferometers joined via a common beam splitter. We show how, in this setup, two kinds of standard interference effects -- namely, single-photon Mach-Zehnder interference and two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference -- interfere with one another, partially canceling each other out. This new perspective, along with the overall pedagogical exposition of this work, is intended as an intuitive illustration of why quantum effects can combine nontrivially and, moreover, of the fundamental notion that quantum interference happens at measurement. This work can serve as a bridge to more advanced quantum mechanical concepts. For instance, analyses of this setup in terms of entanglement have a rich history and can be used to test the predictions of quantum mechanics versus local realism (e.g., as in Hardy's Paradox).</p>

            <p>The effective frequency of a mechanical resonator can be tuned via the spring effect induced by quadratic optomechanical (QOM) coupling, and both spontaneous symmetry breaking and anti-parity-time phase transition were predicted in the QOM systems. Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced significantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field, and divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical point (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenzheng Dong, Yuanlong Wang, Muhammad Qasim Khan</p>
            <p>Precise qubit control in the presence of spatio-temporally correlated noise is pivotal for transitioning to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generically, such noise can also have non-Gaussian statistics, which hampers existing non-Markovian noise spectroscopy protocols. By utilizing frame-based characterization and a novel symmetry analysis, we show how to achieve higher-order spectral estimation for noise-optimized circuit design. Remarkably, we find that the digitally driven qubit dynamics can be solely determined by the complexity of the applied control, rather than the non-perturbative nature of the non-Gaussian environment. This enables us to address certain non-perturbative qubit dynamics more simply. We delineate several complexity bounds for learning such high-complexity noise and demonstrate our single and two-qubit digital characterization and control using a series of numerical simulations. Our results not only provide insights into the exact solvability of (small-sized) open quantum dynamics but also highlight a resource-efficient approach for optimal control and possible error reduction techniques for current qubit devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries, as highly efficient energy storage devices, have garnered significant research interest. A key challenge in their development is to maximize the extractable energy (ergotropy) when operating within a finite-temperature reservoir. To address this, we applied quantum feedback control to the charger and investigated the effects of fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored energy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system exhibits optimal charging parameters. In particular, in a fermionic thermal reservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery performance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a bosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and extraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency. Additionally, we explored the impact of battery size and found that, under a fermionic reservoir, increasing the battery size appropriately can further improve performance.</p>

            <p>The limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have motivated the development of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which are designed to potentially achieve quantum advantage for specific tasks. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms play a critical role in automating the design of high-performance Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) for VQAs. However, existing QAS approaches struggle with large search spaces, leading to substantial computational overhead when optimizing large-scale quantum circuits. Extensive empirical analysis reveals that circuit topology has a greater impact on quantum circuit performance than gate types. Based on this insight, we propose the Topology-Driven Quantum Architecture Search (TD-QAS) framework, which first identifies optimal circuit topologies and then fine-tunes the gate types. In the fine-tuning phase, the QAS inherits parameters from the topology search phase, eliminating the need for training from scratch. By decoupling the large search space into separate topology and gate-type components, TD-QAS avoids exploring gate configurations within low-performance topologies, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity. Numerical simulations across various tasks, under both noiseless and noisy conditions, validate the effectiveness of the TD-QAS framework. This framework advances standard QAS algorithms by enabling the identification of high-performance quantum circuits while minimizing computational demands. These findings indicate that TD-QAS deepens our understanding of VQAs and offers broad potential for the development of future QAS algorithms.</p>

            <p>The precise registration of solid-state quantum emitters to photonic structures is a major technological challenge for fundamental research (e.g. in cavity quantum electrodynamics) and applications to quantum technology. Standard approaches include the complex multi-step fabrication of photonic structures on pre-existing emitters, both registered within a grid of lithographically-defined markers. Here, we demonstrate a marker-free, femtosecond laser writing technique to generate individual quantum emitters within photonic structures. Characterization of 28 defect centers, laser-written at the centers of pre-existing solid immersion lens structures, showed offsets relative to the photonic structure's center of 260~nm in the x-direction and 60~nm in the y-direction, with standard deviations of $\pm 170$~nm and $\pm 90$~nm, respectively, resulting in an average 4.5 times enhancement of the optical collection efficiency. This method is scalable for developing integrated quantum devices using spin-photon interfaces in silicon carbide and is easily extendable to other materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Z. M. McIntyre, W. A. Coish</p>
            <p>As quantum devices scale to larger numbers of qubits, entangling gates between distant stationary qubits will help provide flexible, long-range connectivity in modular architectures. In this work, we present protocols for implementing long-range two-qubit gates mediated by either Fock-state or time-bin qubits -- photonic encodings that are both compatible with the coplanar waveguide resonators commonly used in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). These protocols become deterministic in the limit of vanishing photon loss. Additionally, photon loss can be heralded, signaling a failed two-qubit gate attempt. We model the loss of a time-bin qubit to a dielectric environment consisting of an ensemble of two-level systems (TLSs), which are believed to be the dominant mechanism for dielectric loss in circuit QED architectures. The backaction (on the stationary qubits) associated with the loss of the time-bin qubit is strongly suppressed in a non-Markovian regime where the temporal separation of the time bins is short compared to the dielectric environment's correlation time. This result suggests strategies based on a combination of materials-fabrication and time-bin-qubit optimization for ensuring that the loss of a time-bin qubit is not only heralded, but also approximately backaction-free.</p>

            <h2>A Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Quantum Realizability of Correlations for Arbitrary Normalized Observables in the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt Setup</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryosuke Nogami, Jaeha Lee</p>
            <p>We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quantum state that reproduces given correlation values in the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt (CHSH) setup for any fixed normalized observables. This result addresses a fundamental question shared by both local realism and quantum mechanics: under what conditions a given set of observed data can be reproduced by a physical model. While previous studies have mainly addressed conditions for correlations achievable without specifying the measurement settings, our result gives a finer characterization by treating the observables as fixed in advance. The resulting quantum condition strengthens previously known constraints, such as Tsirel'son's inequalities and the Tsirel'son--Landau inequality, by characterizing statistical constraints explicitly for each specified set of observables. In particular, we show that our condition applies to Bell's original scenario and reveals that whether Bell's original inequality is violated depends sensitively on the chosen observables. More broadly, this perspective offers new insights into how quantum violations of local realism depend on the measurement settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Broadbent, Alex B. Grilo, Nagisa Hara, Arthur Mehta</p>
            <p>In a proof of knowledge (PoK), a verifier becomes convinced that a prover possesses privileged information. In combination with zero-knowledge proof systems, PoKs play an important role in security protocols such as in digital signatures and authentication schemes, as they enable a prover to demonstrate possession of certain information (such as a private key or a credential), without revealing it. A PoK is formally defined via the existence of an extractor, which is capable of reconstructing the key information that makes a verifier accept, given oracle access to any accepting prover. We extend this concept to the setting of a single classical verifier and multiple quantum provers and present the first statistical zero-knowledge (ZK) PoK proof system for problems in QMA. To achieve this, we establish the PoK property for the ZK protocol of Broadbent, Mehta, and Zhao (TQC 2024), which applies to the local Hamiltonian problem. More specifically, we construct an extractor which, given oracle access to a provers' strategy that leads to high acceptance probability, is able to reconstruct the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Our result can be seen as a new form of self-testing, where, in addition to certifying a pre-shared entangled state, the verifier also certifies that a prover has access to a quantum system, in particular, a ground state; this indicates a new level of verification for a proof of quantumness.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.</p>

            <p>Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</p>

In this study, we measure the local optical response of a NbTiN nanowire resonator using a laser-scanning microwave spectroscopy system integrated with a dilution refrigerator. The optical response of the resonator shows correlation with the resonance modes and position, which is attributed to the two-level system around the resonator. These findings not only contribute to the design and understanding of quantum transducers and single-photon detectors, but also to the understandings of catastrophic high-energy particle irradiation events that generate unintended phonons in quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The fluxonium qubit has emerged as a promising candidate for superconducting quantum computing due to its long coherence times and high-fidelity gates. Nonetheless, further scaling up and improving performance remain critical challenges for establishing fluxoniums as a viable alternative to transmons. A key obstacle lies in developing scalable coupling architectures. In this work, we introduce a scalable fluxonium architecture that enables decoupling of qubit states while maintaining tunable couplings between non-computational states. Beyond the well-studied ZZ crosstalk, we identify that always-on interactions involving non-computational levels can significantly degrade the fidelities of initialization, control, and readout in large systems, thereby impeding scalability. Based on two possible physical realizations of the architecture, we demonstrate that the issue can be mitigated by implementing tunable couplings for fluxonium plasmon transitions, meanwhile enabling fast, high-fidelity gates with passive ZZ suppression. This comparative analysis enables us to establish general principles for realizing the architecture while understanding and addressing implementation-specific challenges.</p>

We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using two-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency compared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The change detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative entropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise, suggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore the fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection latency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.</p>

            <p>Cutting edge classical computing today relies on a combination of CPU-based computing with a strong reliance on accelerators. In particular, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) rely heavily on acceleration via GPUs for numerical kernels. In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources. CONQURE is a fully open-source cloud queue framework that presents a novel modular scheduling framework allowing users to offload OpenMP quantum kernels to QPUs as quantum circuits, to relay results back to calling contexts in classical computing, and to schedule quantum resources via our CONQURE API. We show our API has a low overhead averaging 12.7ms in our tests, and we demonstrate functionality on an ion-trap device.

            <p>Quantum systems in nonequilibrium conditions, where coherent many-body interactions compete with dissipative effects, can feature rich phase diagrams and emergent critical behavior. Associated collective effects, together with the continuous observation of quanta dissipated into the environment -- typically photons -- allow to achieve quantum enhanced parameter estimation. However, protocols for tapping this enhancement typically involve intricate measurements on the combined system-environment state. Here we show that many-body quantum enhancement can in fact be obtained through classical measurements, such as photon counting and homodyne detection. We illustrate this in detail for a class of open spin-boson models which can be realized in trapped-ion or cavity QED setups. Our findings highlight a route towards the design of systems that enable a practical implementation of quantum enhanced metrology through continuous classical measurements.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system II</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Yi Guo</p>
            <p>The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopic entanglement of three magnon modes in three cavities via optical parametric amplifier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Zhou, Guo-Qiang Zhang</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to generate bipartite and tripartite entanglements of three magnon modes in a three-cavity system using a nonlinear optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The three magnon modes in three YIG spheres are respectively placed inside three cavities near the maximum magnetic fields of the cavities and coupled to cavity modes via linear magnetic dipole interaction. Additionally, linear coupling interaction exists between two cavities. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that OPA can prepare the three magnon modes in a steady-state entangled state, bipartite and tripartite entanglements increase with the nonlinear interaction strength of OPA. An alternative approach to enhance quantum entanglement involves multiplexed OPA inputs. By employing individual OPA for each cavity, we observe a significant improvement in entanglement generation. All the entanglements are robust against bath temperature.</p>

            <h2>Parallel Repetition for Post-Quantum Arguments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Huang, Yael Tauman Kalai</p>
            <p>In this work, we show that parallel repetition of public-coin interactive arguments reduces the soundness error at an exponential rate even in the post-quantum setting. Moreover, we generalize this result to hold for threshold verifiers, where the parallel repeated verifier accepts if and only if at least $t$ of the executions are accepted (for some threshold $t$). Prior to this work, these results were known only when the cheating prover was assumed to be classical. We also prove a similar result for three-message private-coin arguments. Previously, Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen (STOC 2024) proved such a parallel repetition result in the more general setting of quantum protocols, where the verifier and communication may be quantum. We consider only protocols where the verifier is classical, but obtain a simplified analysis, and for the more general setting of threshold verifiers.</p>

            <p>Direct reproduction of Bialynicki-Birula's quantum solutions using the authors' own equations and initial conditions reveals two fundamental flaws. First, the eigenfunctions exhibit divergence in the region $y<0$, contradicting the claimed decay behavior ($\abs{\phi}\to\infty$ as $y\to -10$) (Figs. 9--11). Second, the apparent parity symmetry displayed in Figures 9--11 is not supported by Equation (21); numerical solutions clearly show asymmetric wavefunctions. Furthermore, all quantum solutions presented in Section IV violate the boundedness requirements of quantum mechanics. These inconsistencies raise serious concerns about the physical validity of the quantum framework underlying the time crystal model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Brandenburger, Pierfrancesco La Mura</p>
            <p>We study how rapidly the direction of time becomes operationally detectable from mesoscopic data when state-weights may be positive or negative. In contrast with classical Markov processes -- where forward evolution is instantly distinguishable from its reverse -- signed dynamics can render the arrow of time undetectable during an initial interval. Assume the generator of the signed dynamics is a symmetric signed Laplacian with a single linear invariant and a phase-space Second Law holds in the form of non-decreasing Rényi-$2$ entropy. Drawing on recent results on eventual exponential positivity of signed Laplacians (Chen et al., 2021), we define a test that correctly identifies the direction of thermodynamic time if conducted over a time interval of length at least $\tau$. We go on to prove that the test cannot deliver an incorrect conclusion if conducted over a shorter interval. Dropping symmetry, we exhibit a superquantum example where $\tau = +\infty$, so that the arrow of time remains permanently undetectable under our test.</p>

            <h2>Superactivation of Bell nonlocality in pure anyonic states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Qian Xu, Wenhao Ye, Li You</p>
            <p>Standard quantum information theory is founded on the assumption that multi-party state space possesses a tensor product structure. Anyons, as quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems, exhibit unique entanglement properties that differ from the conventional quantum systems, resulting from the absence of a tensor product structure in their state spaces. This motivates us to investigate the relationship between Bell nonlocality and entanglement in anyonic states. Specifically, we find that certain pure anyonic states with non-zero anyonic entanglement entropy (AEE) are local, yet exhibit nonlocality when subjected to collective measurements on multiple copies-a phenomenon known as superactivation of nonlocality, which is typically observed in conventional mixed states. To analyze this, we decompose the total entanglement of anyonic states into two components: one from the tensor product structure and the other representing residual contributions. By studying their asymptotic behavior, we find that the former gradually increases and approaches the AEE while the latter diminishes with the number of copies. Crucially, the entanglement component associated with the tensor product structure demonstrates a significant correlation with nonlocality, which explains the observed superactivation of nonlocality. Our findings provide new insights into the connection between entanglement and nonlocality in anyonic systems.</p>

            <p>Developing sensors with large particle numbers $N$ that can resolve subtle physical effects is a central goal in precision measurement science. Entangled quantum sensors can surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), where the signal variance scales as $1/N$, and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL) with variance scaling as $1/N^2$. However, entangled states are typically more sensitive to noise, especially common-mode noise such as magnetic field fluctuations, control phase noise, or vibrations in atomic interferometers. We propose a two-node entanglement-enhanced quantum sensor network for differential signal estimation that intrinsically rejects common-mode noise while remaining robust against local, uncorrelated noise. This architecture enables sensitivities approaching the Heisenberg limit. We investigate two state preparation strategies: (i) unitary entanglement generation analogous to bosonic two-mode squeezing, yielding Heisenberg scaling; and (ii) dissipative preparation via collective emission into a shared cavity mode, offering a $\sqrt{N}$ improvement over the SQL. Numerical simulations confirm that both protocols remain effective under realistic conditions, supporting scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in the presence of dominant common-mode noise.</p>

            <h2>On a dynamic ontic wave model of quantum collapse and measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason D. Runyan</p>
            <p>This work introduces a novel model of quantum entities as physical, spatially extended wavefields, forming the basis for a realist framework for quantum measurement and collapse. Unlike interpretations that postulate hidden variables, observer-induced effects, ad hoc stochastic elements, or multiverse branching, this model derives the Born rule as a consequence of local physical interactions - involving kinetic energy transfer at or above a threshold - acting on an extended wavefield. Central to the model is a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle - not as a statistical or epistemic limitation, but as a dynamical relation between kinetic energy transfer and wavefield contraction. This framework yields testable predictions about how weak, intermediate, and strong quantum interactions modulate spatial localization - predictions consistent with existing experimental findings. The upshot is a unified, falsifiable alternative to prevailing interpretations, and a foundation for a broader research program in wavefield interaction mechanics.</p>

            <p>Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (< 0.35 nm/$\mathrm{\mu m}$}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ < 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.</p>

            <p>Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.</p>

            <p>It is generally believed that the design of cooling protocols requires knowledge of the system's spectrum. In contrast, cooling processes in nature occur whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. But how does nature know how to cool quantum systems? Here we address this question by mimicking a natural cold bath with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state and interact with the system sequentially for a specified time before being discarded. This protocol is equivalent to quantum measurements without keeping the measurement readouts. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without prior knowledge of the system's details when the interactions between the system and the meters, as well as the level splittings of the meters, are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the rotating-wave approximation becomes valid, ensuring that resonant energy-exchange processes, which lead to cooling, dominate over heating. This demonstrates that robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems can be achieved through generic, structure-independent protocols. Our findings thus offer a versatile universal framework for engineering, controlling, and manipulating quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for the purposes of quantum information processing and quantum simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</p>

            <p>A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</p>

Moreover, we introduce a local W1 distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of two states with respect to local observables. We prove a transportation-cost inequality stating that the local W1 distance between a generic state and a state with exponentially decaying correlations is upper bounded by a function of their relative entropy. Finally, we apply such inequality to prove the equivalence between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics and the weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the Hamiltonians whose Gibbs states have exponentially decaying correlations.</p>

            <p>It has been shown that entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which are key concepts in Quantum Mechanics, can be probed in high-energy colliders via processes of fundamental particle scattering. In fact, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured entanglement using top-quark pairs produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Recently, it was shown that spin correlations can be measured in pairs of bottom quarks at the LHC, despite the fact that bottom quarks, unlike top quarks, hadronize before decaying. Here, we demonstrate that quantum correlations can also be studied using bottom-quark pairs, and analyze the feasibility of the observation of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in several collider experiments. Given the low mass of the bottom quark relative to typical energies accessible at the LHC, many of the bottom-quark pairs are in the ultrarelativistic regime, where they can exhibit strong spin entanglement. We find that entanglement of bottom-quark pairs may be measurable even with the LHC Run 2 data, especially with the CMS $B$ parking dataset, while observation of Bell nonlocality may become feasible at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.</p>

            <p>We have previously presented a version of the Weak Equivalence Principle for a quantum particle as an exact analog of the classical case, based on the Heisenberg picture analysis of free particle motion. Here, we take that to a full formalism of quantum mechanics in a generic curved space(time). Our basic perspective is to take seriously the noncommutative symplectic geometry corresponding to the quantum observable algebra. Particle position coordinate transformations and a nontrivial metric assigning an invariant inner product to vectors, and covectors, are implemented accordingly. That allows an analog to the classical picture of the phase space as the cotangent bundle. The mass-independent quantum geodesic equations as equations of free particle motion under a generic metric as a quantum observable are obtained from an invariant Hamiltonian. Hermiticity of momentum observables is to be taken as reference frame dependent. Our results have a big contrast to the alternative obtained based on the Schrödinger wavefunction representation which we argue to be less appealing. Hence, the work points to a very different approach to quantum gravity, plausibly with a quantum Einstein equation suggested.</p>

This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</p>

Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag.

            <p>Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</p>

            <h2>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-André model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-André) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</p>

            <h2>Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristina Armbruster, Gintaras Duda, Thomas G. Wong</p>
            <p>Qubit Touchdown is a two-player, competitive board game that was developed to introduce students to quantum computing. A quantum computer is a new kind of computer that is based on the laws of quantum physics, and it can solve certain problems faster than normal computers because it follows a different set of rules. Qubit Touchdown's game play mirrors the rules of (American) football, with players taking turns moving the football to score the most touchdowns, and no knowledge of quantum computing is needed to play the game. We evaluated the game with 107 public high school students in Precalculus, Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics, and/or AP Physics 1 courses, assessing whether their interest in and self-confidence in their ability to learn quantum computing changed as a result of playing the game and learning about its connections to quantum computing. We also assessed whether the game was easy to learn and enjoyable. We found that students' interest in quantum computing increased slightly ($p<0.05$), but students' self-confidence in their ability to learn quantum computing saw greater gains ($p<0.001$); students also widely considered the game accessible and fun. Thus, Qubit Touchdown could be an effective resource to introduce students to Quantum Computing and boost their confidence in learning about the field. Free printables of the game are available, and professionally produced copies can be purchased on demand.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Hattori, Hirotaka Irie, Tadashi Kadowaki, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Electric Quadrupole Moment-Induced Parity Doubling in Molecules for Symmetry-Violation Searches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Fan, Lan Cheng</p>
            <p>Searches for the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) and nuclear Schiff moment (NSM) have high discovery potential for violations of time ($T$) and parity ($P$) reversal symmetries beyond the Standard Model. Molecules containing heavy nuclei are typically used to enhance the sensitivity to MQMs and NSMs due to their strong internal electric fields and potential octupole deformation. To extract these effects in the laboratory frame, a bias electric field is required to polarize the molecule by mixing states of opposite parity (parity doublets). Typical heavy nuclei that are sensitive to symmetry-violation also possess large nuclear electric quadrupole moments (EQMs) when its nuclear spin is $I\geq1$. We show that EQMs can significantly modify the energy splitting between parity doublet states and thus change the required polarizing electric field. As a result, the EQM-induced energy splitting must be taken into account in designing such experiments. We provide qualitative estimates of parity doubling from EQMs and supporting \textit{ab initio} calculations, along with implications for candidate molecules in symmetry-violation searches.</p>

            <p>Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (< 0.35 nm/$\mu$m}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ < 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.</p>

            <p>The characterisation of quantum networks is fundamental to understanding how energy and information propagates through complex systems, with applications in control, communication, error mitigation and energy transfer. In this work, we explore the use of external probes to infer the network topology in the context of continuous-time quantum walks, where a single excitation traverses the network with a pattern strongly influenced by its topology. The probes act as decay channels for the excitation, and can be interpreted as performing an indirect measurement on the network dynamics. By making use of a Genetic Optimisation algorithm, we demonstrate that the data collected by the probes can be used to successfully reconstruct the topology of any quantum network with high success rates, where performance is limited only by computational resources for large network sizes. Moreover, we show that increasing the number of probes significantly simplifies the reconstruction task, revealing a tradeoff between the number of probes and the required computational power.</p>

            <p>Entanglement serves as a fundamental resource for various quantum information processing tasks. Fidelity of entanglement (which measures the proximity to a maximally entangled state) and various quantum entropies are key indicators for certifying entanglement in a quantum state. Quantum states with high fidelity are particularly useful for numerous information-theoretic applications. Similarly, states possessing negative conditional entropy provide significant advantages in several quantum information processing protocols. In this work, we examine the relationship between these two indicators of entanglement, both in state and channel regimes. First, we present a comprehensive analysis and characterization of channels that reduce fidelity of entanglement beyond a threshold limit of bipartite composite systems. In this context, we introduce the notion of fidelity annihilating channel and discuss its topological characterization, along with various information-theoretic properties. We then provide a comparison between channels that diminish the fidelity of entanglement and negative conditional entropies. Extending our analysis from channels to the state level, we further examine the relationship between the fidelity of entanglement and various quantum entropies for general two-qubit states. We derive the upper bound on Rényi 2-entropy, conditional Rényi 2-entropy, Tsallis 2-entropy, and conditional Tsallis 2-entropy, in terms of the fidelity of entanglement. Finally, we explore the relationship between relative entropy and the fidelity of entanglement of a two qudit quantum state.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights to quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</p>

Controlling the dipolar spin exchange driving the dynamics, we observe striking signatures of sensitivity to the microscopic details underlying the polarization distribution.

These generically modify the characteristics of light traversing a strong-field region. X-ray free-electron lasers constitute a particularly promising probe, due to their brilliance, the possibility of precise control and favourable frequency scaling.

Achieving a sufficiently good signal-to-background separation is key to a successful quantum vacuum experiment. To master this challenge, a darkfield detection concept has recently been proposed.

            <p>We show that the dynamics of the Diósi-Penrose (DP) model of classical gravity can entangle the mechanical degrees of freedom of two separate particles. For standard experiments of gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE), we find that entanglement can be generated if and only if the particles are separated by a distance smaller than some limiting value $d_c$, proportional to the only free parameter of the DP model. Greater distances can be achieved through new experimental configurations, where the initial wave functions of the particles are allowed to spread perpendicularly to the separation axis. Although the DP dynamics asymptotically drives the system to a separable state, we observe that, for reasonable experimental parameters, GIE can survive for more than a day. Our results therefore imply that GIE detection is not enough to validate quantum gravity. Experimental tests of GIE dynamics have nonetheless the potential to falsify the DP model.</p>

            <p>Topological phase transitions challenge conventional paradigms in many-body physics by separating phases that are locally indistinguishable yet globally distinct. Using a quantum simulator of interacting erbium atoms in an optical lattice, we observe such a transition between one-dimensional crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). We detect the critical point through non-local string order parameters and reveal its connection to the transition predicted between the Mott and Haldane insulators. Moreover, we demonstrate a striking property: stacking two identical systems eliminates the transition, confirming the predicted group structure and invertibility of SPTs. Finally, while introducing symmetry-breaking disorder also removes the transition, disorder averaging restores it. Consequently, the adjacent phases realize a form of mixed-state quantum order wherein the criticality between them depends on the observer's information. Our results demonstrate how topology and information influence quantum phase transitions, opening the doors to probing novel critical phenomena in programmable quantum matter.</p>

            <p>In the task of unitarily cooling a quantum system with access to a larger quantum system, known as the machine or reservoir, how does the structure of the machine impact an agent's ability to cool and the complexity of their cooling protocol? Focusing on the task of cooling a single qubit given access to $n$ separable, thermal qubits with arbitrary energy structure, we answer these questions by giving two new perspectives on this task. Firstly, we show that a set of inequalities related to the energetic structure of the $n$ qubit machine determines the optimal cooling protocol, which parts of the machine contribute to this protocol and gives rise to a Carnot-like bound. Secondly, we show that cooling protocols can be represented as perfect matchings on bipartite graphs enabling the optimization of cost functions e.g. gate complexity or dissipation. Our results generalize the algorithmic cooling problem, establish new fundamental bounds on quantum cooling and offer a framework for designing novel autonomous thermal machines and cooling algorithms.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum dynamics in the vicinity of an unstable fixed point subjected to stochastic control. The stochastic competition between the system's inherent instability (pushing trajectories away) and engineered control dynamics (drawing them back to the same point) forms the core of probabilistic control in chaotic systems. Recent studies reveal that this interplay underlies a family of measurement- and feedback-driven dynamical quantum phase transitions. To capture its universal features, we consider the inverted harmonic oscillator, a canonical model whose operator amplitudes diverge. Our control scheme, a quantum version of classical attractor dynamics, employs non-unitary evolution via measurements and conditional resets. By combining numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck analysis, and direct spectra of the quantum channel, we map out the control transition and uncover quantum-specific signatures of the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate the universality of our results within the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos.</p>

In particular we focus on two scenarios: On one hand, we provide bounds on the time that is needed for a control system to implement a given target unitary $U$ and on the other hand we bound the time that is needed to implement the dynamics of a target Hamiltonian $H$ in the worst case. We apply our abstract bounds on physically relevant systems like coupled qubits, spin chains, globally controlled Rydberg atoms and NMR molecules and compare our results to the existing literature. We hope that our bounds can aid experimentalists to identify bottlenecks and design faster quantum control systems.</p>

            <p>Developing sensors with large particle numbers $N$ that can resolve subtle physical effects is a central goal in precision measurement science. Entangled quantum sensors can surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), where the signal variance scales as $1/N$, and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL) with variance scaling as $1/N^2$. However, entangled states are typically more sensitive to noise, especially common-mode noise such as magnetic field fluctuations, control phase noise, or vibrations in atomic interferometers. We propose a two-node entanglement-enhanced quantum sensor network for differential signal estimation that intrinsically rejects common-mode noise while remaining robust against local, uncorrelated noise. This architecture enables sensitivities approaching the Heisenberg limit. We investigate two state preparation strategies: (i) unitary entanglement generation analogous to bosonic two-mode squeezing, yielding Heisenberg scaling; and (ii) dissipative preparation via collective emission into a shared cavity mode, offering a $\sqrt{N}$ improvement over the SQL. Numerical simulations confirm that both protocols remain effective under realistic conditions, supporting scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in the presence of dominant common-mode noise.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid discrimination strategy based on photon-number-resolving detectors and mesoscopic twin-beam states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Razzoli, Alex Pozzoli, Alessia Allevi</p>
            <p>State discrimination is a key challenge in the implementation of quantum communication protocols. Most optical communication protocols rely on either coherent states of light or fragile single-photon states, making it often difficult to achieve robustness and security simultaneously. In this work, we propose a hybrid strategy that operates in the mesoscopic intensity regime, leveraging robust quantum states of light. Our approach combines classical and quantum features: reliable state discrimination based on a classical property of light, and security stemming from nonclassical correlations. Specifically, the receiver uses photon-number-resolving detectors to access the mean photon number of the binary thermal signals encoding the information. The communication channel exploits twin-beam states, inherently sensitive to eavesdropping attacks, to provide a layer of security. This strategy is scalable, allowing for straightforward extension to more complex signal alphabets, and offers a promising route for robust and secure quantum communication in the mesoscopic intensity domain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Marconi, Guillem Müller-Rigat, Jordi Romero-Pallejà, Jordi Tura, Anna Sanpera</p>
            <p>Symmetric quantum states are fascinating objects. They correspond to multipartite systems that remain invariant under particle permutations. This symmetry is reflected in their compact mathematical characterisation and also in their unique physical properties: they exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement and notable robustness against noise and perturbations. These features make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical structure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the theoretical framework, it is essential to develop robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties of symmetric states in experimental settings. In this regard, we explore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell tests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric systems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant applications in which these states outperform other classes of states in specific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum metrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine their contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present the current state of the art in their experimental generation, ranging from systems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review the most recent breakthroughs obtained in the different experimental realizations. Despite the significant progress made in recent years regarding the characterization and application of symmetric quantum states, several intriguing questions remain unsolved. We conclude this review discussing some of these open problems and outlining promising directions for future research.</p>

            <p>Quantum observables in the form of few-point correlators are the key to characterizing the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. In experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented to restore sensitivities of quantum observables. Using a 103-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we characterize ergodic dynamics using the second-order out-of-time-order correlators, OTOC$^{(2)}$. In contrast to dynamics without time reversal, OTOC$^{(2)}$ are observed to remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long time scales. Furthermore, by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution and randomizing the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture, we observe substantial changes in OTOC$^{(2)}$ values. This indicates that OTOC$^{(2)}$ is dominated by constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in configuration space. The observed interference mechanism endows OTOC$^{(2)}$ with a high degree of classical simulation complexity, which culminates in a set of large-scale OTOC$^{(2)}$ measurements exceeding the simulation capacity of known classical algorithms. Further supported by an example of Hamiltonian learning through OTOC$^{(2)}$, our results indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Isoholonomic inequalities and speed limits for cyclic quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ole Sönnerborn</p>
            <p>Quantum speed limits set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve between states. Traditional bounds -- such as those by Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin -- rely on state distinguishability and become trivial for cyclic evolutions where the initial and final states coincide. In this work, we explore an alternative approach based on isoholonomic inequalities, which bound the length of closed state space trajectories in terms of their holonomy. Building on a gauge-theoretic framework for mixed state geometric phases, we extend the concept of isoholonomic inequalities to closed curves of isospectral and isodegenerate density operators. This allows us to derive new quantum speed limits that remain nontrivial for cyclic evolutions. Our results reveal deep connections between the temporal behavior of cyclic quantum systems and holonomy.</p>

            <p>We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics (QM) where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI) formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action enabled by the novel notion of timelike correlations.</p>

            <h2>Synchronization for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satvik Maurya, Swamit Tannu</p>
            <p>Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical qubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface code, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the surface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle, thereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the production of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the use of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements. Logical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits involved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow down its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle, thereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors. To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define three policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the baseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they are synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the Active policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by inserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces the logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The Hybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the synchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction. Furthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed synchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x with a circuit-level noise model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Qi, Chao-Han Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation, uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework, advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shijie Wei, Jingwei Wen, Xiaogang Li, Peijie Chang, Bozhi Wang, Franco Nori, Guilu Long</p>
            <p>Time symmetry in quantum mechanics, where the current quantum state is determined jointly by both the past and the future, offers a more comprehensive description of physical phenomena. This symmetry facilitates both forward and backward time evolution, providing a computational advantage over methods that rely on a fixed time direction. In this work, we present a nonvariational and \textit{time-symmetric quantum algorithm} for addressing the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian, leveraging the coherence between forward and backward time evolution. Our approach enables the simultaneous determination of both the ground state and the highest excited state, as well as the direct identification of arbitrary eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Unlike existing methods, our algorithm eliminates the need for prior computation of lower eigenstates, allowing for the direct extraction of any eigenstate and energy bandwidth while avoiding error accumulation. Its non-variational nature ensures convergence to target states without encountering the barren plateau problem. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the non-unitary evolution using both the linear combination of unitaries and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Our algorithm is applied to compute the energy bandwidth and spectrum of various molecular systems, as well as to identify topological states in condensed matter systems, including the Kane-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We anticipate that this algorithm will provide an efficient solution for eigenvalue problems, particularly in distinguishing quantum phases and calculating energy bands.</p>

            <p>Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory is a promising approach for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on both classical and quantum platforms, with dynamics that can be realized as a quantum channel. We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\mathrm{polylog}(T/\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.</p>

In particular, we show that one can not only obtain different spatial interaction dependencies with respect to the static bath scenarios, but also in qualitatively different regimes due to the time-dependent nature of the bath, for example, when the emitters have different frequencies. This work sheds light on the interplay between non-equilibrium photonics and quantum optics and can serve as the basis for analyzing Floquet photonic lattices in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme that induces quantum correlations in optomtomechanical systems. Our benchmark system consists of two optically coupled optical cavities which interact with a common mechanical resonator. The optical cavities host saturable nonlinearity which triggers either gain or losses in each cavity. Without these nonlinearities, there are no quantum correlations, i.e., entanglement and steering, generated in the system. By turning on the nonlinearities, gain and losses are switched on, enabling flexible generation of both quantum entanglement and quantum steering in our proposal. These generated quantum correlations seem to be insensitive to the induced gain, while the induced losses through saturation effect efficiently enhance quantum correlations. Moreover, the robustness of the generated quantum correlations against thermal fluctuations is further improved under nonlinear saturation scenario. This work suggests a way of using nonlinear saturation effects to engineer quantum correlations even at room temperature, which are useful for quantum information processing, quantum computational tasks, and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</p>

Operating near the thermodynamic noise limit with sub-eV energy resolution, TESs offer a powerful approach for probing light DM in the sub-GeV mass range. Optical TESs, realized on superconducting films with critical temperatures below 150 mK, achieve energy thresholds below 100 meV and enable precise calorimetric detection of individual energy depositions. We model TES response by incorporating fundamental noise sources and applying optimal filtering techniques, and evaluate their sensitivity across a range of DM interaction channels, accounting for in-medium effects in the target material. We show that even ng-month-scale exposures can reach previously unexplored DM-electron scattering cross sections below $10^{-27}$ cm$^2$ for sub-MeV masses, and can probe the MeV-scale mass range for DM-nucleon couplings. Combining high energy resolution, photon-number sensitivity, and scalability, optical TESs provide a compelling quantum sensing platform for rare-event searches at the intersection of particle physics and quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Searches for the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) and nuclear Schiff moment (NSM) have high discovery potential for violations of time ($T$) and parity ($P$) reversal symmetries beyond the Standard Model. Molecules containing heavy nuclei are typically used to enhance the sensitivity to MQMs and NSMs due to their strong internal electric fields and potential octupole deformation. To extract these effects in the laboratory frame, a bias electric field is required to polarize the molecule by mixing states of opposite parity (parity doublets). Typical heavy nuclei that are sensitive to symmetry-violation also possess large nuclear electric quadrupole moments (EQMs) when its nuclear spin is $I\geq1$. We show that EQMs can significantly modify the energy splitting between parity doublet states and thus change the required polarizing electric field. As a result, the EQM-induced energy splitting must be taken into account in designing such experiments. We provide qualitative estimates of parity doubling from EQMs and supporting \textit{ab initio} calculations, along with implications for candidate molecules in symmetry-violation searches.</p>

            <p>Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey Bravyi, Dongjin Lee, Zhi Li, Beni Yoshida</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that logical states of quantum error-correcting codes have to be highly entangled such that codes capable of correcting more errors require more entanglement to encode a qubit. Here, we show that the validity of this belief depends on the specific code and the choice of entanglement measure. To this end, we characterize a tradeoff between the code distance $d$ quantifying the number of correctable errors, and the geometric entanglement measure of logical states quantifying their maximal overlap with product states or more general ``topologically trivial" states. The maximum overlap is shown to be exponentially small in $d$ for three families of codes: (1) low-density parity check codes with commuting check operators, (2) stabilizer codes, and (3) codes with a constant encoding rate. Equivalently, the geometric entanglement of any logical state of these codes grows at least linearly with $d$. On the opposite side, we also show that this distance-entanglement tradeoff does not hold in general. For any constant $d$ and $k$ (number of logical qubits), we show there exists a family of codes such that the geometric entanglement of some logical states approaches zero in the limit of large code length.</p>

            <p>We study the problem of estimating frequency response functions of systems of coupled, classical harmonic oscillators using a quantum computer. The functional form of these response functions can be mapped to a corresponding eigenproblem of a Hermitian matrix $H$, thus suggesting the use of quantum phase estimation. Our proposed quantum algorithm operates in the standard $s$-sparse, oracle-based query access model. For a network of $N$ oscillators with maximum norm $\lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}$, and when the eigenvalue tolerance $\varepsilon$ is much smaller than the minimum eigenvalue gap, we use $\mathcal{O}(\log(N s \lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}/\varepsilon)$ algorithmic qubits and obtain a rigorous worst-case query complexity upper bound $\mathcal{O}(s \lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}/(\delta^2 \varepsilon) )$ up to logarithmic factors, where $\delta$ denotes the desired precision on the coefficients appearing in the response functions. Crucially, our proposal does not suffer from the infamous state preparation bottleneck and can as such potentially achieve large quantum speedups compared to relevant classical methods. As a proof-of-principle of exponential quantum speedup, we show that a simple adaptation of our algorithm solves the random glued-trees problem in polynomial time. We discuss practical limitations as well as potential improvements for quantifying finite size, end-to-end complexities for application to relevant instances.</p>

            <p>The intrinsic rotation of electron vortex beams, governed by their phase structure, has been experimentally observed in magnetic fields by breaking the beam's cylindrical symmetry. However, conventional Landau states, which predict three fixed angular frequencies, cannot fully account for the existing experimental observations. To address this limitation, we introduce and derive the generalized Gouy rotation angle, which links the Gouy phase of an extended Landau state -- featuring a periodically oscillating beam width -- to the experimentally observed angular variation. In particular, this framework predicts a broader spectrum of angular frequencies and captures the reversal of rotation direction observed in electron vortex beams with negative topological charge. Calculations based on experimental parameters show good agreement with previously published data and are further validated here by numerical simulations using the Chebyshev method. Our results are, in principle, applicable to any system involving electron vortex beams in uniform magnetic fields, and provide a foundation for exploring vortex electrons in Glaser and other nonuniform magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Computation of Electronic Structure with Projector Augmented-Wave Method and Plane Wave Basis Set</h2>

            <p>Quantum simulation of materials is a promising application area of quantum computers. To practically realize this promise, we must reduce quantum resources while maintaining accuracy. In electronic structure calculations on classical computers, resource reduction has been achieved by using the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) and plane wave basis sets. However, the PAW method generalized for many-body states introduces non-orthogonality effects which impede its direct application to quantum computing. In this work, we develop a unitary variant of the PAW (UPAW) that preserves the orthogonality constraints. We provide a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition of the UPAW Hamiltonian to enable ground state estimation using qubitized quantum phase estimation. Additionally, we further improve algorithmic efficiency by extending classical down-sampling techniques into the quantum setting. We then estimate quantum resources for crystalline solids to estimate the energy within chemical accuracy with respect to the full basis set limit, and also consider a supercell approach which is more suitable for calculations of defect states. We provide the quantum resources for energy estimation of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond which is a challenging system for classical algorithms and a quintessential problem in the studies of quantum point defects.</p>

            <h2>Hardness-dependent quantum adiabatic schedules for the maximum-independent-set problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sébastien Perseguers</p>
            <p>We propose a numerical approach to design highly efficient adiabatic schedules for analog quantum computing, focusing on the maximum-independent-set problem and neutral atom platforms. On the basis of a representative dataset of small graphs, we present numerical evidence that the optimum schedules depend principally on the hardness of the problem rather than on its size. These schedules perform better than the benchmark protocols and admit a straightforward implementation in the hardware. This allows us to extrapolate the results to larger graphs and to successfully solve moderately hard problems using QuEra's 256-qubit Aquila computer. We believe that extending our approach to hybrid algorithms could be the key to solving the hardest instances with the current technology, making yet another step toward real-world applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoyou Wang, Hong Qiao, Andrew N. Cleland, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>Quantum random access memory (QRAM) promises simultaneous data queries at multiple memory locations, with data retrieved in coherent superpositions, essential for achieving quantum speedup in many quantum algorithms. We introduce a transmon-controlled phonon router and propose a QRAM implementation by connecting these routers in a tree-like architecture. The router controls the motion of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons based on the state of the control transmon, implementing the core functionality of conditional routing for QRAM. Our QRAM design is compact, supports fast routing operations, and avoids frequency crowding. Additionally, we propose a hybrid dual-rail encoding method to detect dominant loss errors without additional hardware, a versatile approach applicable to other QRAM platforms. Our estimates indicate that the proposed QRAM platform can achieve high heralding rates using current device parameters, with heralding fidelity primarily limited by transmon dephasing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcelo Janovitch, Matteo Brunelli, Patrick P. Potts</p>
            <p>Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elija Perrier</p>
            <p>AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based upon principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is fundamentally classical in nature - as are the environments in which it is modelled. Given the universe is quantum mechanical in nature and the exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical systems classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical analogues of AIXI. To address this question, we extend the framework to quantum information and present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce a model of quantum agent/environment interaction based upon quantum and classical registers and channels, showing how quantum AIXI agents may take both classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components of AIXI in quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations upon quantum Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally affects QAIXI models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatrice Magni, Xhek Turkeshi</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p>

            <h2>Giant Atom with Disorders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muming Han, Lingzhen Guo</p>
            <p>The study of giant atoms goes beyond the local interaction paradigm in the conventional quantum optics, and predicts novel phenomena, such as oscillating bound states in the continuum (BICs) and decoherence-free interaction (DFI) that do not exist in small atoms, for some particular parameter settings of coupling positions and strengths. However, in the realistic experiments to implement giant-atom systems, there is always some level of disorder both in coupling positions and strengths. In this work, we investigate the effects of disorder on the phenomena related to giant atoms. We find that the giant-atom related phenomena are robust to both disorders of coupling positions and strengths in the Markovian regime, but more sensitive to the disorder of coupling positions in the non-Markovian regime. Our work shows that, to observe the non-Markovian phenomenon such as (oscillating) BICs in giant-atom systems, more precision is needed to control the disorder of coupling positions than that of the coupling strengths in the experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ievgen I. Arkhipov, Franco Nori, Şahin K. Özdemir</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems have attracted considerable interest over the last few decades due to their unique spectral and dynamical properties not encountered in Hermitian counterparts. An intensely debated question is whether non-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are operated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current analysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for Hermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space is intrinsically curved. Here, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) defined on the curved Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This covariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a consistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the covariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems can be mapped to the ordinary QFI of corresponding Hermitian systems, and establish conditions when they become dual to each other, thus revealing a deeper geometric connection between the two. Importantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the covariant QFI and identifies the criteria under which quantum sensing in pseudo-Hermitian systems can exhibit supremacy over Hermitian ones.</p>

            <p>We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Information versus Physicality: On the Nature of the Wavefunctions of Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. S. Unnikrishnan</p>
            <p>The physical states of matter and fields are represented in the quantum theory with complex valued wavefunctions, or more generally by quantum states in an abstract linear vector space. Determining the physical nature of wavefunctions remains an open problem that is at the very core of quantum mechanics, About a decade ago, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolf (PBR) claimed to prove an ontologically real status of wavefunctions by ruling out $\psi$-epistemic models. The result was obtained by associating wavefunctions to hypothetical distributions of notional physical states, and by examining whether some physical states were associated with more than one wavefunction, a criterion they chose for defining a wavefunction as `epistemic'. I show that the starting assumption in the PBR argument, of associating a wavefunction with a distribution of physical states, is flawed and contradictory to the linear structure of quantum mechanics coupled with its quadratic Born's rule. Since none of the axioms or calculations of observable statistical results in the standard quantum theory depends on specifying the physical nature of a $\psi$-function, the considerations in the PBR paper, involving a standard process of the preparation and projective measurements of quantum states, cannot address the ontological status of the wavefunctions in space and time.</p>

            <p>Noise is a major challenge for building practical quantum computing systems. Precise characterization of quantum noise is crucial for developing effective error mitigation and correction schemes. However, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors on many current platforms can introduce large ambiguity into conventional noise characterization methods. In this work, we propose a scheme for enhancing quantum noise characterization using additional energy levels. We first develop a comprehensive theory on the identifiability of n-qudit SPAM noise given high-quality single-qudit control, showing the existence of gauge freedoms which can be completely described using subsystem depolarizing maps. We then show how to use these extra energy levels to reduce the gauge ambiguity in characterizing both SPAM and gate noise in the qubit subspace. We experimentally implement these ideas on a superconducting quantum computing device and demonstrate a qutrit-enabled enhancement in noise characterization precision.</p>

            <p>Complex quantum networks are not only hard to establish, but also difficult to simulate due to the exponentially growing state space and noise-induced imperfections. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that leverage quantum computers and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices as simulators for quantum networks, including noisy quantum devices, channels, and protocols. Rather than considering noise as an undesired property that needs to be mitigated, we demonstrate how imperfections in quantum hardware can be utilized to simulate real-world communication devices under realistic conditions beyond classical simulation capabilities. Our approach allows NISQ devices with modest noise to simulate devices with more significant imperfections enabling large-scale, detailed simulations of quantum networks, where exact error models can be treated. It also improves over direct implementation and benchmarking of real networks, as waiting times for information transmission, locality, and memory restrictions do not apply. This framework can offer advantages in flexibility, scalability, and precision, demonstrating that NISQ devices can serve as natural testbeds for complex quantum networks, and paving the way for more efficient quantum network simulations.</p>

            <p>Error mitigation has enabled quantum computing applications with over one hundred qubits and deep circuits. The most general error mitigation methods rely on a faithful characterization of the noise channels of the hardware. However, fundamental limitations lead to unlearnable degrees of freedom of the underlying noise models when considering qubits. Here, we show how to leverage non-computational states as an additional resource to learn state-preparation errors in superconducting qubits. This allows one to fully constrain the noise models. We can thus independently and accurately mitigate state-preparation errors, gate errors and measurement errors. Our proposed method is also applicable to dynamic circuits with mid-circuit measurements. This work opens the door to improved error mitigation for measurements, both at the end of the circuit and mid-circuit.</p>

            <p>We present the Quantum Paldus Transform: an efficient quantum algorithm for block-diagonalising fermionic, spin-free Hamiltonians in the second quantisation. Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin (GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \times SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities, we provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods for the Paldus transform with $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, paving the way for significant advancements in quantum simulation on quantum computers enabled by the UGA paradigm.</p>

            <p>We introduce Genetic Transformer Assisted Quantum Neural Networks (GTQNNs), a hybrid learning framework that combines a transformer encoder with a shallow variational quantum circuit and automatically fine tunes the circuit via the NSGA-II multi objective genetic algorithm. The transformer reduces high-dimensional classical data to a compact, qubit sized representation, while NSGA-II searches for Pareto optimal circuits that (i) maximize classification accuracy and (ii) minimize primitive gate count an essential constraint for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Experiments on four benchmarks (Iris, Breast Cancer, MNIST, and Heart Disease) show that GTQNNs match or exceed state of the art quantum models while requiring much fewer gates for most cases. A hybrid Fisher information analysis further reveals that the trained networks operate far from barren plateaus; the leading curvature directions increasingly align with the quantum subspace as the qubit budget grows, confirming that the transformer front end has effectively condensed the data. Together, these results demonstrate that GTQNNs deliver competitive performance with a quantum resource budget well suited to present-day NISQ devices.</p>

            <p>In quantum information processing, the development of fast and robust control schemes remains a central challenge. Although quantum adiabatic evolution is inherently robust against control errors, it typically demands long evolution times. In this work, we propose to achieve rapid adiabatic evolution, in which nonadiabatic transitions induced by fast changes in the system Hamiltonian are mitigated by flipping the nonadiabatic transition matrix using $\pi$ pulses. This enables a faster realization of adiabatic evolution while preserving its robustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in both two-level and three-level systems. Numerical simulations show that, for the same evolution duration, our scheme achieves higher fidelity and significantly suppresses nonadiabatic transitions compared to the traditional STIRAP protocol.</p>

            <p>Holonomic quantum computation (HQC) offers an inherently robust approach to quantum gate implementation by exploiting quantum holonomies. While adiabatic HQC benefits from robustness against certain control errors, its long runtime limits practical utility due to increased exposure to environmental noise. Nonadiabatic HQC addresses this issue by enabling faster gate operations but compromises robustness. In this work, we propose a scheme for fast holonomic quantum gates based on the $\pi$-pulse method, which accelerates adiabatic evolution while preserving its robustness. By guiding the system Hamiltonian along geodesic paths in the parameter space and applying phase-modulating $\pi$ pulses at discrete points, we realize a universal set of holonomic gates beyond the conventional adiabatic limit. Our scheme allows for arbitrary single-qubit and two-qubit controlled gates within a single-loop evolution and provides additional tunable parameters for flexible gate design. These results demonstrate a promising path toward high-fidelity, fast, and robust quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology promises enhanced precision in parameter estimation by exploiting quantum effects. The traditional framework of metrology commonly assumes unlimited access to resources, overlooking resource constraints in realistic scenarios. As such, the optimal strategies therein are often infeasible in practice. Here, we investigate quantum metrology where the total energy consumption of the probe state preparation, intermediate control operations, and the final measurement is subject to an energy constraint. We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for characterizing energy-constrained quantum multi-step processes, which can be applied to other tasks of quantum information processing beyond metrology. Based on the framework, we develop a general optimization method for energy-constrained quantum metrology that determines the optimal precision as well as the corresponding optimal strategy. Applying our method to phase estimation, we show that while the estimation precision can benefit arbitrarily from increasing dimension with unconstrained energy, energy constraints result in an ultimate precision scaling of $1/E^2$ in an infinite-dimensional system, where $E$ is the available energy, which reveals that limited energy could be an essential barrier to precision improvement.</p>

We show that a $\textit{square root law}$ (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method.

We introduce a Quantum Mixture-Density Network (Q-MDN) that employs parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently model multimodal distributions. By representing an exponential number of modes with a compact set of qubits and parameters, Q-MDN predicts Gaussian mixture components with high resolution. We evaluate Q-MDN on two benchmark tasks: the quantum double-slit experiment and chaotic logistic bifurcation. In both cases, Q-MDN outperforms classical MDNs in mode separability and prediction sharpness under equal parameter budgets. Our results demonstrate a practical quantum advantage in probabilistic regression and highlight the potential of quantum machine learning in capturing complex stochastic behavior beyond the reach of classical models.</p>

            <h2>Out of Tune: Demystifying Noise-Effects on Quantum Fourier Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maja Franz, Melvin Strobl, Leonid Chaichenets, Eileen Kuehn, Achim Streit, Wolfgang Mauerer</p>
            <p>The field of variational quantum algorithms, in particular quantum machine learning (QML), produced numerous theoretical and empirical insights in recent years. As variational quantum circuits (VQCs) can be represented by Fourier series that contain an exponentially large spectrum in the number of input features, hope for quantum advantage remains. Nevertheless, properties of quantum Fourier models (QFMs) are not yet fully understood, in particular how they could potentially outperform classical alternatives. Viewing VQCs with Fourier lenses opens up possibilities to analyse which classes of functions can be tackled by variational algorithms such as QML, while also illuminating and quantifying remaining constraints and challenges. Considering that noise and imperfections remain dominant factors in the development trajectory from noisy intermediate-scale to fault-tolerant quantum computers, the aim of this work is to shed light on key properties of QFMs when exposed to noise. In particular, we systematically analyse the effect of noise on the Fourier spectrum, expressibility and entangling capability of QFMs by conducting large-scale numerical simulations of quantum systems. This may help to better utilise hardware resources, and guide the construction of tailored error correction schemes. We find that decoherent noise exerts a uniform deleterious effect on all the tested ansätze, manifesting in the vanishing of Fourier coefficients, expressibility and entangling capability. We note however, that the detrimental influence of noise is less pronounced in some ansätze than in others, suggesting that these might possess greater resilience to noise.</p>

            <h2>More entropy from shorter experiments using polytope approximations to the quantum set</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyejung H. Jee, Florian Curchod, Mafalda Almeida</p>
            <p>We introduce a systematic method for constructing polytope approximations to the quantum set in a variety of device-independent quantum random number generation (DI-QRNG) protocols. Our approach relies on two general-purpose algorithms that iteratively refine an initial outer-polytope approximation, guided by typical device behaviour and cryptographic intuition. These refinements strike a balance between computational tractability and approximation effectiveness. By integrating these approximations into the probability estimation (PE) framework [Zhang et al., PRA 2018], we obtain significantly improved certified entropy bounds in the finite-size regime. We test our method on various bipartite and tripartite DI-QRNG protocols, using both simulated and experimental data. In all cases, it yields notably higher entropy rates with fewer device uses than the existing techniques. We further extend our analysis to the more demanding task of randomness amplification, demonstrating major performance gains without added complexity. These results offer an effective and ready-to-use method to prove security-with improved certified entropy rates-in the most common practical DI-QRNG protocols. Our algorithms and entropy certification with PE tools are publicly available under a non-commercial license at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Entangled two-mode Gaussian states constitute an important building block for continuous variable quantum computing and communication protocols and are thus of high demand for many experiments. In this work, we study such kind of states which are extracted from multimode light generated via type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) in lossy waveguides. For such states, we demonstrate that the squeezing quantifies entanglement and we construct a measurement basis which results in the maximal bipartite entanglement. We illustrate our findings by numerically solving the spatial master equation for PDC in a Markovian environment. The optimal measurement modes are compared with two widely-used broadband bases: the Mercer-Wolf basis (the first-order coherence basis) and the Williamson-Euler basis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javad Kazemi, Michael Schuler, Christian Ertler, Wolfgang Lechner</p>
            <p>We present a native approach for realizing multi-qubit parity phase gates in neutral atom systems through global phase modulation of a Rydberg excitation laser. By shaping the temporal profile of the laser's phase, we enable high fidelity, time efficient entangling operations between multiple qubits without requiring individual qubit addressing. To mitigate intrinsic noise sources including spontaneous decay and motional effects, we develop a noise-aware optimal control framework that reduces gate errors under the presence of noise while maintaining smooth pulse profiles suitable for experimental implementation. In addition to equidistant qubit arrangements, we explore the impact of non-equidistant atomic configurations, where interaction inhomogeneity becomes significant. In these cases, the flexibility of our control approach helps to compensate for such variations, supporting reliable gate performance across different spatial layouts. These results facilitate the practical implementation of complex, multi-qubit quantum operations in near-term neutral atom quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bora Ulu, Nicolas Brunner, Mirjam Weilenmann</p>
            <p>Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) allows two distant parties to establish a secret key, based only on the observed Bell nonlocal distribution. It remains however, unclear what the minimal resources for enabling DIQKD are and how to maximize the key rate from a given distribution. In the present work, we consider a scenario where several copies of a given quantum distribution are jointly processed via a local and classical wiring operation. We find that, under few assumptions, it is possible to activate device-independent key. That is, starting from a distribution that is useless in a DIQKD protocol, we obtain a positive key rate by wiring several copies together. We coin this effect device-independent key activation. Our analysis focuses on the standard DIQKD protocol with one-way post-processing, and we resort to semi-definite programming techniques for computing lower bounds on the key rate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yilun Xu, Abhi D. Rajagopala, Neelay Fruitwala, Gang Huang</p>
            <p>In the last decade, quantum computing has grown from novel physics experiments with a few qubits to commercial systems with hundreds of qubits. As quantum computers continue to grow in qubit count, the classical control systems must scale correspondingly. While a few expensive multi-board commercial solutions exist, most open-source solutions are limited to single-board radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC). The essential requirements for a multi-board solution are clock synchronization among multiple boards and the ability to transfer data with low latency for performing real-time feedback. In this work, we design a clock synchronization framework to distribute deterministic clock and synchronize the clock counters across multiple RFSoC boards to generate time-aligned radio frequency (RF) pulses used to control qubits. We also develop a data communication system over a fiber link to transfer quantum measurement data among multiple field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This clock synchronization and data communication module has been integrated into the open-source quantum control system, QubiC, to enable the execution of quantum algorithms across multiple boards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design through bench tests with a room-temperature qubit readout emulator.</p>

            <p>We predict and experimentally demonstrate a new type of collective (cooperative) coupling effect where a disordered atomic ensemble absorbs light with a rise-time longer (i. e., at a rate slower) than what is dictated by single-atom physics. This effect, which we name subabsorption, can be viewed as the absorptive analog of subradiance. The experiment is performed using a dilute ensemble of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms with a low optical depth, and time-resolving the absorption of a weak (tens of photons per pulse) resonant laser beam. In this dilute regime, the collective interaction relies on establishing dipole-dipole correlations over many atoms; i.e., the interaction is not dominated by the nearest neighbors. As a result, subabsorption is highly susceptible to motional dephasing: even a temperature increase of 60 $\mu$K is enough to completely extinguish the subabsorption signal. We also present a theoretical model whose results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. The model uses density-dependent dephasing rate of the long-range dipole-dipole correlations as a single adjustable parameter. Experiment-theory comparison indicates a dephasing coefficient of $\beta/2 \pi = 4.9 \times 10^{-5}$ Hz~cm$^3$, which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the known dipole-dipole line broadening coefficient in $^{87}$Rb.</p>

            <p>Quantum processors based on neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical tweezers have appealing properties, including relatively easy qubit number scaling and the ability to engineer arbitrary gate connectivity with atom movement. However, these platforms are inherently prone to atom loss, and the ability to replace lost atoms during a quantum computation is an important but previously elusive capability. Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and re-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining coherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that include single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement while compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up to 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine midcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional branching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell state. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to replenish atoms in a tweezer array from an atomic beam while maintaining coherence of existing atoms -- a key step towards execution of logical computations that last longer than the lifetime of an atom in the system.</p>

            <p>We certify asymmetry in the configuration of the Bloch vectors of a set of three unknown qubit states within the dimensionally bounded prepare-and-measure scenario. To do this, we construct a linear witness from three simpler witnesses as building blocks, each featuring, along with two binary measurement settings, three preparations; two of them are associated with the certification task, while the third one serves as an auxiliary. The final witness is chosen to self-test some target configuration. We numerically derive a bound $Q_{\text{mirror}}$ for any mirror-symmetric configuration, thereby certifying asymmetry if this bound is exceeded (e.g. experimentally) for the unknown qubit configuration. We also consider the gap $(Q_{\text{max}}-Q_{\text{mirror}})$ between the analytically derived overall quantum maximum $Q_{\text{max}}$ and the mirror-symmetric bound, and use it as a quantifier of asymmetry in the target configuration. Numerical optimization shows that the most asymmetric configuration then forms a right scalene triangle on the unit Bloch sphere. Finally, we implement our protocol on a public quantum processor, where a clear violation of the mirror-symmetric bound certifies asymmetry in the configuration of our experimental triple of qubit states.</p>

            <p>The $N$-representability problem places fundamental constraints on reduced density matrices (RDMs) that originate from physical many-fermion quantum states. Motivated by recent developments in functional theories, we introduce a hierarchy of ensemble one-body $N$-representability problems that incorporate partial knowledge of the one-body reduced density matrices (1RDMs) within an ensemble of $N$-fermion states with fixed weights $w_i$. Specifically, we propose a systematic relaxation that reduces the refined problem -- where full 1RDMs are fixed for certain ensemble elements -- to a more tractable form involving only natural occupation number vectors. Remarkably, we show that this relaxed problem is related to a generalization of Horn's problem, enabling an explicit solution by combining its constraints with those of the weighted ensemble $N$-representability conditions. An additional convex relaxation yields a convex polytope that provides physically meaningful restrictions on lattice site occupations in ensemble density functional theory for excited states.</p>

            <p>Determining eigenvalues is a computationally expensive task that is crucial for countless applications in natural sciences. Toward this end, we introduce the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm, a multireference quantum variant of the Lanczos algorithm designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenvalues, including degenerate states. We present three different compact quantum circuits to evaluate the required expectation values, each suited to different problem settings. To investigate the impact of the number and fidelity of the initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. The results demonstrate that using multiple initial reference states improves the convergence of the algorithm, especially in realistic precision-limited simulations and in cases where a single reference fails to simultaneously retrieve all desired eigenvalues. Furthermore, the QBKSP algorithm enables the computation of degenerate eigenstates and respective multiplicity by imposing appropriate convergence criteria.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Pichler, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moiré materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines -- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the core tensor.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</p>

In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks.

            <p>We systematically investigate the ground state and dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates subject to a position-dependent detuning. This detuning induces three related quantities-a synthetic magnetic field, an angular velocity, and an angular momentum-which, due to trap anisotropy, may point in different directions. When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or bi-conical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of the synthetic magnetic field and the excitations of the collective mode in quantum fluids, providing a foundation for future developments in quantum simulation and high-precision sensing technologies.</p>

            <p>We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.</p>

            <p>Dynamic structure factor (DSF) is important for understanding excitations in many-body physics; it reveals information about the spectral and spatial correlations of fluctuations in quantum systems. Collective phenomena like quantum phase transitions of ultracold atoms are addressed by harnessing density fluctuations. Here, we calculate the DSF of a nonequilibrium spinless Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) from the perspective of dissipative phase transition (DPT) in a steady state. Our methodology uses a homogeneous mean-field approximation to make the single-site hierarchy simpler and applies the Lindbladian perturbation method (LPM) to go beyond the single site, limited by the ratio of the inter-site hopping term to the Liouvillian gap as a small parameter. Our results show that the DSF near a DPT point is characteristically different from that away from the transition point, providing a clear density spectral signature of the DPT. In addition to comparing the two numerical frameworks, the mean-field results serve as a benchmark for proof-of-principle robustness of LPM. Despite the numerical difficulty, our methodology provides a computationally accessible route for studying density fluctuations in an open lattice quantum system without requiring large-scale computation.</p>

            <p>Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is a strong and readily accessible optical nonlinearity enabling a wide array of applications and research directions. For instance, the three-wave mixing process has been employed to great success for narrow-linewidth lasers, sensing applications, microscopy, and signal processing. While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation, there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering mechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in standard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with microscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which has not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic scattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS interaction. This work provides a foundation for a wide range of applications and further research including sensing applications, new approaches to investigate TLS physics, and Brillouin-scattering-based quantum science and technology.</p>

            <p>We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-Büttiker framework.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous slow-down of the bound state dynamics in a non-locally coupled quantum circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biswajit Paul, Suman Mondal, Tapan Mishra</p>
            <p>Additional hopping channels in a tight-binding lattice is known to introduce faster dynamics of a quantum mechanical particle. However, we show that in the case of a repulsively bound state, the dynamics becomes abnormally slow when next-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping is allowed for the particles. We show that such slowing down occurs for some magic strength of the NNN hopping at which the bound state band exhibits a quasi-flatband feature. We reveal this anomalous dynamical behavior by analyzing the quench dynamics of two nearest neighbor (NN) spin excitations (magnons) on a ferromagnetic chain by allowing both NN and NNN couplings. By implementing digital quantum computing simulations on a NISQ device, we obtain such non-trivial signatures and complement the results with exact numerical calculations. Moreover, through perturbative arguments, we reveal that the slowing down is due to the destructive interference between different paths associated to the bound state dynamics.</p>

            <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Hypergraph Partitioning of Quantum Circuits with Hybrid Execution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane Sweeney, Krishnendu Guha</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithms offer an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for a range of computational problems. The fundamental mechanisms underlying quantum computation required the development and construction of quantum computers. These devices are referred to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. Not only are NISQ devices extremely limited in their qubit count but they also suffer from noise during computation and this problem only gets worse as the size of the circuit increases which limits the practical use of quantum computers for modern day applications. This paper will focus on utilizing quantum circuit partitioning to overcome the inherent issues of NISQ devices. Partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits has allowed for the execution of quantum circuits that are too large to fit on one quantum device. There have been many previous approaches to quantum circuit partitioning and each of these approaches differ in how they work with some focusing on hardware-aware partitioning, optimal graph-based partitioning, multi-processor architectures and many more. These approaches achieve success in their objective but they often fail to scale well which impacts cost and noise. The ultimate goal of this paper is to mitigate these issues by minimizing 3 important metrics; noise, time and cost. To achieve this we use dynamic partitioning for practical circuit cutting and we take advantage of the benefits of hybrid execution where classical computation will be used alongside quantum hardware. This approach has proved to be beneficial with respect to noise with classical execution enabling a 42.30% reduction in noise and a 40% reduction in the number of qubits required in cases where a mixture of classical and quantum computation were required.</p>

            <h2>Lower bounds on the number of rounds of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm required for guaranteed approximation ratios</h2>

            <p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm, also known in its generalization as the quantum alternating operator ansatz, (QAOA) is a heuristic hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding high-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, such as maximum satisfiability. While the QAOA is well studied, theoretical results as to its runtime or approximation ratio guarantees are still relatively sparse. We provide some of the first lower bounds for the number of rounds (the dominant component of QAOA runtimes) required for the QAOA. For our main result, we (i) leverage a connection between quantum annealing times and the angles of the QAOA to derive a lower bound on the number of rounds of the QAOA with respect to the guaranteed approximation ratio. We apply and calculate this bound with Grover-style mixing unitaries and (ii) show that this type of QAOA requires at least a polynomial number of rounds to guarantee any constant approximation ratios for most problems. We also (iii) show that the bound depends only on the statistical values of the objective functions, and when the problem can be modeled as a $k$-local Hamiltonian, can be easily estimated from the coefficients of the Hamiltonians. For the conventional transverse-field mixer, (iv) our framework gives a trivial lower bound to all bounded-occurrence local cost problems and for all strictly $k$-local cost Hamiltonians matching known results that constant approximation ratio is obtainable with a constant-round QAOA for a few optimization problems from these classes. Using our proof framework, (v) we recover the Grover lower bound for unstructured search and, with small modification, show that our bound applies to any QAOA-style search protocol that starts in the ground state of the mixing unitaries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zakari Denis, Giuseppe Carleo</p>
            <p>In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems. However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with non-variational approaches.</p>

The hPIMC algorithm leverages the successes of classical PIMC as a computational tool for high-dimensional system studies by exactly simulating dissipation using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional on a classical computer. We achieve a quantum speed-up over the classical algorithm by computing short-time matrix elements of the quantum propagator on a quantum computer. We show that the component of imaginary-time evolution can be performed accurately using the recently developed Probabilistic Imaginary-Time Evolution (PITE) algorithm, and we introduce a novel low-depth circuit for approximate real-time evolution under the kinetic energy operator using a Discrete Variable Representation (DVR). We test the accuracy of the approximation by computing the position-position thermal correlation function of a proton transfer reaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lina Vandré, Jarn de Jong, Frederik Hahn, Adam Burchardt, Otfried Gühne, Anna Pappa</p>
            <p>Graph states are a class of multi-partite entangled quantum states that are ubiquitous in quantum information. We study equivalence relations between graph states under local unitaries (LU) to obtain distinguishing methods both in local and in networked settings. Based on the marginal structure of graph states, we introduce a family of easy-to-compute LU-invariants. We show that these invariants uniquely identify the entanglement classes of every graph state up to 8 qubits and discuss their reliability for larger numbers of qubits. To handle larger graphs, we generalize tools to test for local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states that work by condensing large graphs into smaller graphs. In turn, we show that statements on the equivalence of these smaller graphs (which are easier to compute) can be used to infer statements on the equivalence of the original, larger graphs. We analyze LU-equivalence in two key settings - with and without allowing for the permutation of qubits. We identify entanglement classes, whose marginal structure does not allow us to distinguish them. As a result, we increase the bound on the number of qubits where the LU-LC conjecture holds from 8 to 10 qubits in the setting where qubit permutations are allowed.</p>

            <p>In active imaging protocols, information about an object is encoded into the spatial mode of a scattered photon. Recently the quantum limits of active imaging have been explored with levitated nanoparticles, which experience a multimode radiation pressure backaction (the photon recoil force) due to radiative scattering of the probe field. Here we extend the analysis of multimode backaction to compliant surfaces, accessing a broad class of mechanical resonators and fruitful analogies to quantum imaging. As an example, we consider imaging of the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting can be understood to arise from spatiotemporal photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product in the limit of purely spatial (intermodal) coupling, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatiotemporal backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light, providing a mechanism for entangling desired pairs of spatial modes. In conjunction with high-Q nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Uncertain Quantum Critical Metrology: From Single to Multi Parameter Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Mihailescu, Steve Campbell, Karol Gietka</p>
            <p>Critical quantum metrology relies on the extreme sensitivity of a system's eigenstates near the critical point of a quantum phase transition to Hamiltonian perturbations. This means that these eigenstates are extremely sensitive to all the parameters of the Hamiltonian. In realistic settings, there is always some degree of uncertainty in the control parameters used to tune the system to criticality. These uncertainties, while not the target of estimation, can significantly affect the attainable precision, effectively acting as nuisance parameters in the estimation process. Despite being a practically relevant source of noise, their impact on critical metrology has been largely overlooked. In this work we present a general framework that interpolates between single- and multiparameter estimation settings, enabling a systematic analysis of how such uncertainties influence sensitivity. We apply this framework to the paradigmatic transverse field Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, explicitly demonstrating how uncertainty in control parameters affects the metrological performance of critical sensors. For finite-size systems, we identify a fundamental trade-off between robustness to uncertainty and the ability to retain a quantum advantage at the critical point. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the practical limitations of critical quantum metrology and provide a route toward its more resilient implementation.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel, feedback-free method to cancel the effects of decoherence in the dynamics of open quantum systems subject to dephasing. The protocol makes use of the coupling with an auxiliary system when they are both subject to the same noisy dynamics, in such a way that their interaction leads to cancellation of the noise on the system itself. This requires tuning the strength of the coupling between main and auxiliary systems as well as the ability to prepare the auxiliary system in a Fock state, which solely depends on the coupling strength. We investigate the protocol's efficiency to protect NOON states against dephasing in setups such as tweezers arrays of cold atoms. We show that the protocol's efficiency is robust against fluctuations of the optimal parameters and, remarkably, that it is independent of the temporal noise features. Therefore, it can be applied to cancel both Markovian and non-Markovian noise effects, in the regime where error-correction protocols become inefficient.</p>

In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on multiple quantum processing units up to 100 qubits, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM for short quenches for finite-size systems.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the particular example considered here, paths having an Abelian AC phase factor, also have an AC phase that is path-independent, whereas paths having a non-Abelian AC phase factor may have an AC phase that is path-dependent (i.e., not topological).</p>

In the present paper, we discuss, with a pedagogical approach, the quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method, revisiting the main steps to obtain the wave function associated with this model, and briefly discussing the relation between this oscillator and the generation of squeezed states. As examples of didactic applications of time-dependent harmonic oscillators and the Lewis-Riesenfeld method in quantum mechanics courses, we solve the following problems: the calculation of the transition probability associated with a harmonic oscillator which undergoes jumps in its frequency, and the analysis of the dynamics of a quantum particle in a Paul trap.</p>

            <p>Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.</p>

            <p>In classical communication, the introduction of polychromatic resources has rapidly boosted classical networks' rate and scale. Quantum communication is now at a similar critical stage in its development, and therefore, it is essential to investigate polychromatic quantum communication networks. In this letter, we report a polychromatic continuous-variable quantum communication network enabled by optical frequency combs. The multi-mode density matrices constituted by polychromatic quantum networks are studied. Considering the limited mode isolation, the maximum amount of information that eavesdroppers can obtain is recalculated, therefore, the total secret key rate is provided. We have also demonstrated that, compared to other multiplexing techniques, polychromatic quantum networks can theoretically achieve a secret key rate without decreasing with the increase in users. In the experiment, direct-transmission type and round-trip type quantum communication networks were built using optical frequency combs and dual-comb interference detection technology. The Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol has been validated, with a network capacity of 19 and a total secret key rate of 8.75 Gbps at a uniform distance of 5 km (asymptotic case), 0.82 Mbps at 120 km (finite-size effect), 89.10 Mbps at 40 km (compsable security), 13.66 Mbps at 40 km (compsable finite-size security).

            <p>The theoretical foundation of quantum sensing is rooted in the Cramér-Rao formalism, which establishes quantitative precision bounds for a given quantum probe. In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the multi-parameter Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) applies. Since this is a matrix inequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parametrization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cramér-Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.</p>

Gap engineering allowed us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of a few. This reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</p>

A central challenge in this paradigm is verifying the correctness of computational outcomes when subcircuits are executed independently following circuit cutting. Here we propose a cross-platform fidelity estimation algorithm tailored for modular architectures. Our method achieves substantial reductions in sample complexity compared to previous approaches designed for single-processor systems. We experimentally implement the protocol on modular superconducting quantum processors with up to 6 qubits to verify the similarity of two 11-qubit GHZ states. Beyond verification, we show that our algorithm enables a federated quantum kernel method that preserves data privacy. As a proof of concept, we apply it to a 5-qubit quantum phase learning task using six 3-qubit modules, successfully extracting phase information with just eight training samples. These results establish a practical path for scalable verification and trustworthy quantum machine learning of modular quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We introduce more general notions of Clifford codes and stabilizer codes, the latter we call weak stabilizer codes. This is all formulated in the language of projective representation theory of finite groups and we give a novel description of the detectable errors for a Clifford code. We give a complete characterization of when a Clifford code is also a weak stabilizer code in the case where the considered error model is a nice error basis. We also give examples of infinite families of non-stabilizer Clifford codes as well as examples of non-Clifford weak stabilizer codes. The latter of these types of examples is a class of codes that have not been studied in the same systematic framework as Clifford codes and stabilizer codes.</p>

            <p>In this work, I analyze the quantum fluctuations and the thermal fluctuations in the framework of quantum mechanics. Being recognized as incoherent perturbations with different features, fluctuations of these two types lead to dissipative terms in the optical Bloch equations. The method allows one to use the optical Bloch equation to analyze time-dependent processes in the finite-temperature fluctuations.

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate that the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm, implemented on IonQ's fully connected trapped-ion quantum processors, offers an efficient approach to solving dense higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. Specifically, we tackle protein folding on a tetrahedral lattice for up to 12 amino acids, representing the largest quantum hardware implementations of protein folding problems reported to date. Additionally, we address MAX 4-SAT instances at the computational phase transition and fully connected spin-glass problems using all 36 available qubits. Across all considered cases, our method consistently achieves optimal solutions, highlighting the powerful synergy between non-variational quantum optimization approaches and the intrinsic all-to-all connectivity of trapped-ion architectures. Given the expected scalability of trapped-ion quantum systems, BF-DCQO represents a promising pathway toward practical quantum advantage for dense HUBO problems with significant industrial and scientific relevance.</p>

            <h2>Network nonlocality with continuous variables: probing nonbilocality through pseudospin measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudip Chakrabarty, Amit Kundu, A. S. Majumdar</p>
            <p>Quantum networks offer a compelling platform for probing nonlocal correlations beyond the Bell scenario. While network nonlocality has been well studied in discrete-variable (DV) systems, its exploration in continuous-variable (CV) systems remains limited. In this work, we study the bilocal scenario, the simplest quantum network, in a CV framework using pseudospin measurements. We show that two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states violate the bilocality inequality for any nonzero squeezing, with the violation increasing monotonically and reaching the maximum in the infinite squeezing limit. The robustness of this violation is explored in the presence of local thermal noise. Next, we demonstrate nonbilocality in two key non-Gaussian states, viz., the entangled coherent state and the CV Werner state. Finally, we investigate the enhancement of nonbilocal correlations through photon subtraction applied to the TMSV state. We show that a coherent superposition of single-photon subtractions across modes enables maximal bilocality violation even at zero squeezing, demonstrating non-Gaussianity as a strong resource in the low-squeezing regime. Our findings underscore the potential of CV systems for realizing network-based quantum correlations.</p>

            <p>Recent investigations suggest that the discrete linear unitary group $U(N)$ can be represented by interlacing a finite sequence of diagonal phase operations with an intervening unitary operator. However, despite rigorous numerical justifications, no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that elements of $U(N)$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $N$-parameter phases alternating with $1$-parameter propagators of a lattice Hamiltonian. The proof is based on building a Lie group by alternating these two operators and showing its completeness to represent $U(N)$ for a finite number of layers, which is numerically found to be exactly $N$. This architecture can be implemented using elementary optical components and can successfully reconstruct arbitrary unitary matrices. We propose example devices such as optical logic gates, which perform logic gate operations using a single-layer lossless and passive optical circuit design.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Power Superbroadening of Spectral Line Profiles on IBM Quantum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov</p>
            <p>Power broadening refers to the widening of the spectral line profile in a two-state quantum transition as the strength of the driving field increases. This phenomenon commonly arises in continuous-wave driving when the radiation field's intensity exceeds the transition's saturation intensity and it has been extensively studied in spectroscopy. For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral response of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a rectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth shapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic for the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 020802 (2024)], in a dramatic paradigm shift, we have demonstrated experimentally that for Lorentzian-shaped pulses, the opposite effect - power narrowing - takes place: the width of the spectral profile decreases when the driving pulse amplitude increases, with a narrowing factor of as much as 10 observed. While in high-resolution spectroscopy the push is for eliminating or even inverting the power broadening, there are applications where it is used to an advantage for it facilitates off-resonance excitation. Here, we present a number of shaped pulses that exhibit power broadening much greater than that of the rectangular pulse of the same pulse area. They are grouped in two families of pulse shapes. In particular, in regard to the width of the second Rabi oscillation maximum, the quadratic pulse family shows an increase by a factor of 3.3 whereas the even-exponent pulse family exhibits an increase by a factor of more than 3.5.</p>

            <p>Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is one of the most accessible nonlinear optical phenomena and has been widely studied since its theoretical discovery one hundred years ago. The scattering mechanism is a three-wave-mixing process between two optical fields and one acoustic field and has found a broad range of applications spanning microscopy to ultra-narrow-linewidth lasers. Building on the success of utilizing this nonlinearity at a classical level, a rich avenue is now being opened to explore Brillouin scattering within the paradigm of quantum optics. Here, we take a key step in this direction by employing quantum optical techniques yet to be utilized for Brillouin scattering to characterize the second-order coherence of Stokes scattering across the Brillouin lasing threshold. We use a silica microsphere resonator and single-photon counters to observe the expected transition from bunched statistics of thermal light below the lasing threshold to Poissonian statistics of coherent light above the threshold. Notably, at powers approaching the lasing threshold, we also observe super-thermal statistics, which arise due to instability and a "flickering" in and out of lasing as the pump field is transiently depleted. The statistics observed across the transition, including the "flickering", are a result of the full nonlinear three-wave-mixing process and cannot be captured by a linearized model. These measurements are in good agreement with numerical solutions of the three-wave Langevin equations and are well demarcated by analytical expressions for the instability and the lasing thresholds. These results demonstrate that applying second-order-coherence and photon-counting measurements to Brillouin scattering provides new methods to advance our understanding of Brillouin scattering itself and progress toward quantum-state preparation and characterization of acoustic modes.</p>

            <p>Polarization and spin correlations in diboson systems serve as powerful tools for precision tests and searches for new physics. Recently, interpreting these observables through the lens of quantum information, for instance by examining whether the diboson systems exhibit entanglement, has introduced a compelling new dimension to these studies. We analyze the angular coefficients in the processes $pp\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and $h\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$, incorporating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections. Guided by the fundamental properties of the spin density matrix, we assess the stability of the two-qutrit interpretation under radiative effects. For the $pp \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process, NLO QCD corrections preserve the two-qutrit structure but weaken entanglement indicators, an effect that can be partially mitigated by jet binning. In contrast, electroweak corrections introduce non-factorizable contributions that modify the quantum properties of the system. While these effects can be largely depleted by selecting events with a double-resonant $ZZ$ structure, such a kinematic handle is not available for Higgs decays. In the $h \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ channel, singly-resonant NLO electroweak corrections substantially distort the angular coefficients, challenging the description of these events as a two-qutrit system.</p>

However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions. We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment.

            <p>We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent z. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of Krylov complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao-Ran Hu, Katsuyoshi Sone, Feng-Kun Guo, Tetsuo Hyodo, Ian Low</p>
            <p>We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</p>

            <h2>On whether quantum theory needs complex numbers: the foil theories perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yìlè Yīng, Maria Ciudad Alañón, Daniel Centeno, Jacopo Surace, Marina Maciel Ansanelli, Ruizhi Liu, David Schmid, Robert W. Spekkens</p>
            <p>Recent work by Renou et al. (2021) has led to some controversy concerning the question of whether quantum theory requires complex numbers for its formulation. We promote the view that the main result of that work is best understood not as a claim about the relative merits of different representations of quantum theory, but rather as a claim about the possibility of experimentally adjudicating between standard quantum theory and an alternative theory -- a foil theory -- known as real-amplitude quantum theory (RQT). In particular, the claim is that this adjudication can be achieved given only an assumption about the causal structure of the experiment. Here, we aim to shed some light on why this is possible, by reconceptualizing the comparison of the two theories as an instance of a broader class of such theory comparisons. By recasting RQT as the subtheory of quantum theory that arises by symmetrizing with respect to the collective action of a time-reversal symmetry, we can compare it to other subtheories that arise by symmetrization, but for different symmetries. If the symmetry has a unitary representation, the resulting foil theory is termed a twirled quantum world, and if it does not (as is the case in RQT), the resulting foil theory is termed a swirled quantum world. We show that, in contrast to RQT, there is no possibility of distinguishing any twirled quantum world from quantum theory given only an assumption about causal structure. We also define analogues of twirling and swirling for an arbitrary generalized probabilistic theory and identify certain necessary conditions on a causal structure for it to be able to support a causal compatibility gap between the theory and its symmetrized version. We draw out the implications of these analyses for the question of how a lack of a shared reference frame state features into the possibility of such a gap.</p>

Algorithms, throughout which this distribution is a proper (positive) probability distribution can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. We leverage recent results on the geometry of the set of KD-positive states to construct previously unknown classically-simulable (bound) states. Finally, we show that KD nonpositivity is a resource monotone for quantum computation, establishing KD nonpositivity as a necessary resource for computational quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>Divisibility of dynamical maps is a central notion in the study of quantum non-Markovianity, providing a natural framework to characterize memory effects via time-local master equations. In this work, we generalize the notion of divisibility of quantum dynamical maps from the Schrödinger to the Heisenberg picture. While the two pictures are equivalent at the level of physical predictions, we show that the divisibility properties of the corresponding dual maps are, in general, not equivalent. This inequivalence originates from the distinction between left and right generators of time-local master equations, which interchange roles under duality. We demonstrate that Schrödinger and Heisenberg divisibility are distinct concepts by constructing explicit dynamics divisible only in one picture. Furthermore, we introduce a quantifier for the violation of Heisenberg P-divisibility, analogous to the trace-distance-based measure of non-Markovianity, and provide it with an operational interpretation in terms of the guessing probability between effects. Our results show that Heisenberg divisibility is an independent witness of memory effects and highlight the need to consider both pictures when characterizing non-Markovian quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks offer a compelling platform for probing nonlocal correlations beyond the Bell scenario. While network nonlocality has been well studied in discrete-variable (DV) systems, its exploration in continuous-variable (CV) systems remains limited. In this work, we study the bilocal scenario, the simplest quantum network, in a CV framework using pseudospin measurements. We show that two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states violate the bilocality inequality for any nonzero squeezing, with the violation increasing monotonically and reaching the algebraic maximum in the infinite squeezing limit. The robustness of this violation is explored in the presence of local thermal noise. Next, we demonstrate nonbilocality in two key non-Gaussian states, viz., the entangled coherent state and the CV Werner state. Finally, we investigate the enhancement of nonbilocal correlations through photon subtraction applied to the TMSV state. We show that a coherent superposition of single-photon subtractions across modes enables maximal bilocality violation even at zero squeezing, demonstrating non-Gaussianity as a strong resource in the low-squeezing regime.

            <p>Two-level systems (TLS) are known to be a dominant source of dissipation and decoherence in superconducting qubits. Superconducting resonators provide a convenient way to study TLS-induced loss due to easier design and fabrication in comparison to devices that include non-linear elements. However, accurately measuring TLS-induced loss in a resonator in the quantum regime is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the temporal fluctuations of the TLS, leading to uncertainties of 30% or more. To address these limitations, we develop a multi-wave resonator device that extends the resonator length from a standard quarter-wave $\lambda/4$ to $N\lambda/4$ where $N = 37$ at 6GHz. This design provides two key advantages: the TLS-induced fluctuations are reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ due to spatial averaging over an increased number of independent TLS, and the measurement SNR for a given intra-resonator energy density improves by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$. The multi-wave resonator also has fundamental and harmonic resonances that allow one to study the frequency dependence of TLS-induced loss. In this work we fabricate both multi-wave and quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators formed from thin-film aluminum on a silicon substrate, and characterize their TLS properties at both 10mK and 200mK. Our results show that the power-dependent TLS-induced loss measured from both types of resonators agree well, with the multi-wave resonators achieving a five-fold reduction in measurement uncertainty due to TLS fluctuations, down to 5%. The $N\lambda/4$ resonator also provides a measure of the fully unsaturated TLS-induced loss due to the improved measurement SNR at low intra-resonator energy densities. Finally, measurements across seven harmonic resonances of the $N\lambda/4$ resonator between 4GHz - 6.5GHz reveals no frequency dependence in the TLS-induced loss over this range.</p>

In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer (BBOPM) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a complex interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise.

            <p>Spectroscopic methods play a vital role in quantum sensing, which uses the quantized nature of atoms or molecules to reach astonishing precision for sensing of, e.g., electric or magnetic fields. In the theoretical treatment, one typically invokes semiclassical methods to describe the light-matter interaction between quantum emitters, e.g., atoms or molecules, and a strong coherent laser field. However, these semiclassical approaches struggle to predict the stochastic measurement fluctuations beyond the mean value, necessary to predict the sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing protocols. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on the recently developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory (PRFT) which is capable to predict the measurement statistics describing higher order statistics of coherent quantum states of light. The PRFT constructs flow equations for the cumulants of the photonic measurement statistics utilizing only the semiclassical dynamics of the matter system. We apply the PRFT to spectroscopic quantum sensing using dissipative two-level and four-level systems (describing electric field sensing with Rydberg atoms), and demonstrate how to calculate the Fisher information of the measurement statistics with respect to various system parameters. In doing so, we demonstrate that the PRFT is a flexible tool allowing to improve the sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing devices by several orders of magnitudes.</p>

            <h2>Correcting a noisy quantum computer using a quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum computers require error correction to achieve universal quantum computing. However, current decoding of quantum error-correcting codes relies on classical computation, which is slower than quantum operations in superconducting qubits. This discrepancy makes the practical implementation of real-time quantum error correction challenging. In this work, we propose a decoding scheme that leverages the operations of the quantum circuit itself. Given a noisy quantum circuit $A$, we train a decoding quantum circuit $B$ using syndrome measurements to identify the logical operators needed to correct errors in circuit $A$. The trained quantum circuit $B$ can be deployed on quantum devices, such as superconducting qubits, to perform real-time decoding and error correction. Our approach is applicable to general quantum codes with multiple logical qubits and operates efficiently under various noise conditions, and the decoding speed matches the speed of the quantum circuits being corrected. We have conducted numerical experiments using surface codes up to distance 7 under circuit-level noise, demonstrating performance on par with the classical minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. Interestingly, our method reveals that the traditionally classical task of decoding error-correcting codes can be accomplished without classical devices or measurements. This insight paves the way for the development of self-correcting quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Diagrammatic techniques simplify a weakly interacting many-body problem into an effective few-quasiparticle problem within a system of interest (SOI). If scattering events, mediated by a bath, between those quasiparticles can be approximated as density-density interactions, the bath behaves like an effective external potential. On the other hand, exchange interactions could entangle those quasiparticles and the bath, leading to an open quantum system that induces quantum decoherence and spectral broadening. We investigate the renormalized interaction between the SOI and the bath, employing a projection operator technique similar to the one used in the Nakajima-Zwanzig method. We find that the frequency variation of this renormalized interaction is analogous to the quasiparticle residue and provides a measure of the SOI-bath separability that serves as the lower bound of the SOI-bath entanglement entropy. In the weak-coupling regime and continuum limit, we demonstrate that the degree of SOI-bath separability corresponds to the quasiparticle spectral weight in the single-impurity Anderson model and find that the loss of quantum information to the continuum of the bath can be understood as a decay process where an initial single-impurity state escapes to a thermal bath. This work provides a direction for connecting energy dissipation in quasiparticles propagation to the loss of quantum information in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Insightful Approach to Quantum Noise Suppression Below the Standard Quantum Limit Using a Single Mirror and Beam Splittert</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun-Hyun Youn</p>
            <p>When a coherent electromagnetic wave passes through a 50:50 beam splitter (BS), it is divided equally into two parts. However, the quantum noise associated with the resulting coherent states, despite being reduced in amplitude by half, remains fundamentally constrained by the quantum noise limit, independent of the intensity. By placing a mirror at the unused input port of the BS, a standing wave is formed in the vicinity of the mirror, which influences the vacuum fluctuations of the coherent state at the BS output. Using semi-classical and quantum mechanical approaches, we calculate the vacuum fluctuations induced by the mirror and demonstrate that the vacuum noise originating from the mirror side periodically reaches zero at the BS output. Leveraging this effect, we show that the vacuum fluctuations of the light split by the BS can be readily reduced below the quantum noise limit. Furthermore, through feedback mechanisms, the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field at the other output port can also be suppressed below the quantum noise limit. These findings provide a pivotal insight into the manipulation of electromagnetic noise, with broad implications for all experiments involving quantum noise control.</p>

Our demonstration features cases in which the control qubit was in one of its logical basis states, and not in their superposition, due to dephasing by tweezer beam intensity fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how our protocol generalizes to a broad class of unitary operations and larger qubit systems, enabling a single-pulse implementation of $n$-controlled unitaries.</p>

            <h2>Designing toroidal cavities for quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. A. Lütken</p>
            <p>Toroidal microwave cavities are investigated for potential use in quantum information storage and computation. Since exact analytical results are not available for this geometry, extensive numerical simulation has been used to develop a universal phenomenological model ("spectral flow diagram"). This model is needed to guide the non-trivial design of toroidal resonators. A host of new modes that do not exist in cylindrical cavities are classified, including novel counter-intuitive ground states, and "dark nodal modes" that are decoupled from the environment in the absence of antennae. Numerical results are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The existence of dark nodal modes in a shallow smooth cavity geometry that offers easy access for high quality surface treatment, suggests that high-Q toroidal cavities may be exploited for long-term storage of quantum information used in quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Superconducting Three-Qubit Gates for Surface-Code Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephan Tasler, Josias Old, Lukas Heunisch, Verena Feulner, Timo Eckstein, Markus Müller, Michael J. Hartmann</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is one of the crucial building blocks for developing quantum computers that have significant potential for reaching a quantum advantage in applications. Prominent candidates for QEC are stabilizer codes for which periodic readout of stabilizer operators is typically implemented via successive two-qubit entangling gates, and is repeated many times during a computation. To improve QEC performance, it is thus beneficial to make the stabilizer readout faster and less prone to fault-tolerance-breaking errors. Here we design a 3-qubit CZZ gate for superconducting transmon qubits that maps the parity of two data qubits onto one measurement qubit in a single step. We find that the gate can be executed in a duration of $35\,$ns with a fidelity of F$=99.96 \, \%$. To optimize the gate, we use an error model obtained from the microscopic gate simulation to systematically suppress Pauli errors that are particularly harmful to the QEC protocol. Using this error model, we investigate the implementation of this 3-qubit gate in a surface code syndrome readout schedule. We find that for the rotated surface code, the implementation of CZZ gates increases the error threshold by nearly 50\% to $\approx 1.2\,\%$ and decreases the logical error rate, in the experimental relevant regime, by up to one order of magnitude, compared to the standard CZ readout protocol. We also show that for the unrotated surface code, strictly fault-tolerant readout schedules can be found. This opens a new perspective for below-threshold surface-code error correction, where it can be advantageous to use multi-qubit gates instead of two-qubit gates to obtain a better QEC performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Themba Hodge, Eric Mascot, Stephan Rachel</p>
            <p>Topological quantum computation, featuring qubits built out of anyonic excitations known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), have long presented an exciting pathway towards scalable quantum computation. Recently, the advent of altermagnetic materials has presented a new pathway towards localized MZMs on the boundary of two-dimensional materials, consisting of an altermagnetic film, subject to a superconducting proximity effect from a superconducting substrate. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the Néel vector. Using this mechanism, on a square platform, we utilize a time-dependent method to simulate the Z-gate via braiding, and then extend this to a larger H-junction, where we implement the $\sqrt{X}$ and $\sqrt{Z}$ gate on a single-qubit system. Further, this structure is eminently scalable to many-qubit systems, thus providing the essential ingredients towards universal quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing experiments are transitioning from running on physical qubits to using encoded, logical qubits. Fault-tolerant computation can identify and correct errors, and has the potential to enable the dramatically reduced logical error rates required for valuable algorithms. However, it requires flexible control of high-fidelity operations performed on large numbers of qubits. We demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computation on a quantum processor with 256 qubits, each an individual neutral Ytterbium atom. The operations are designed so that key error sources convert to atom loss, which can be detected by imaging. Full connectivity is enabled by atom movement. We demonstrate the entanglement of 24 logical qubits encoded into 48 atoms, at once catching errors and correcting for, on average 1.8, lost atoms. We also implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with up to 28 logical qubits encoded into 112 atoms, showing better-than-physical error rates. In both cases, "erasure conversion," changing errors into a form that can be detected independently from qubit state, improves circuit performance. These results begin to clear a path for achieving scientific quantum advantage with a programmable neutral atom quantum processor.</p>

            <p>Scaling up a superconducting quantum computer will likely require quantum communication between remote chips, which can be implemented using an itinerant microwave photon in a transmission line. To realize high-fidelity communication, it is essential to control the frequency and temporal shape of the microwave photon. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of frequency-tunable shaped microwave photons without resorting to any frequency-tunable circuit element. We develop a framework which treats a microwave resonator as a band-pass filter mediating the interaction between a superconducting qubit and the modes in the transmission line. This interpretation allows us to stimulate the photon emission by an off-resonant drive signal. We characterize how the frequency and temporal shape of the generated photon depends on the frequency and amplitude of the drive signal. By modulating the drive amplitude and frequency, we achieve a frequency tunability of 40 MHz while maintaining the photon mode shape time-symmetric. Through measurements of the quadrature amplitudes of the emitted photons, we demonstrate consistently high state and process fidelities around 95\% across the tunable frequency range. Our hardware-efficient approach eliminates the need for additional biasing lines typically required for frequency tuning, offering a simplified architecture for scalable quantum communication.</p>

We examine recent experimental studies that show partial indications of quantum advantage and describe current limitations including noise, barren plateaus, scalability issues, and the lack of formal proofs of performance improvement over classical methods. The main contribution is a ten-year outlook (2025-2035) that outlines possible developments in supervised QML, including a roadmap describing conditions under which QML may be used in applied research and enterprise systems over the next decade.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion of the curve govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential and effective scalar potential in the system's Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed, revealing that the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and the pseudo-magnetic flux are topologically governed by the surface geometry. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Further, spin evolution in a closed trajectory-Viviani's curve, exemplifies the surface-dependent spin orientation and path-ordering sensitivity of the non-Abelian gauge potential. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.</p>

            <p>Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</p>

            <p>Graph states and their entanglement properties are pivotal for the development of quantum computing and technologies. For qubits, local complementation, a graphical rule that connects all the equivalent states under Local Clifford (LC) operations, was used for the complete characterization of all the LC equivalence classes up until 12 particles, assisting applications in quantum error correction and state preparation protocols optimization. This concept has been extended for qudits. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the entanglement classes up until 7 qutrits, mapping each class into an orbit. The graph-theoretic properties of the orbits are studied, illuminating the rich structure they have. Clear connections between the connectivity of the orbits and the entanglement properties are observed. The correlations between the graph-theoretic properties and the Schmidt measure provide useful insights regarding qudit state preparation and fault-tolerance. This work is accompanied by a repository consisting of the code to extract the orbits and perform the presented statistical analysis. The strong interplay between quantum theory and graph theory is well-known and extensively studied for qubits. Our work provides practical tools and results to assist this endeavor for the qudit case.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Temporally Correlated Dephasing Noise on the Fidelity of the 2-Qubit Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souvik Ghosh</p>
            <p>Understanding the influence of realistic noise on quantum algorithms is paramount for the advancement of quantum computation. While often modeled as Markovian, environmental noise in quantum systems frequently exhibits temporal correlations, leading to non-Markovian dynamics that can significantly alter algorithmic performance. This paper investigates the impact of temporally correlated dephasing noise, modeled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, on the fidelity of the 2-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. We perform numerical simulations using Qiskit, systematically varying the noise strength ($\sigma_{\text{OU}}$) and correlation time ($\tau_c$) of the OU process. Our results demonstrate that the algorithm's fidelity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\tau_c$, particularly at higher noise strengths, with certain intermediate correlation times proving more detrimental than others. We find that a standard Markovian dephasing model, matched to the single-step error variance of the OU process, accurately predicts fidelity only in the limit of very short correlation times. For longer correlation times, the Markovian approximation often overestimates the algorithm's fidelity, failing to capture the complex error dynamics introduced by the noise memory. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating non-Markovian characteristics for accurate performance assessment of quantum algorithms on near-term devices and underscore the limitations of simpler, memoryless noise models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Venkat Abhignan, Bidyut Bikash Boruah, R. Srikanth, Ashutosh Singh</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of quantum correlations in Bell, Werner, and maximally entangled mixed states of two qubits subjected to correlated amplitude-damping channels. Our primary focus is to evaluate the robustness of entanglement as a resource for quantum information protocols such as dense coding, teleportation, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering under the influence of noise. In addition, we investigate the behaviour of other quantum correlations, including quantum discord and coherence, and analyze their hierarchy under decoherence. To counteract the detrimental effects of the channels, we apply the weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal (WMR) protocol, comparing the effectiveness of single-qubit and two-qubit WMR techniques. Our results show that the two-qubit WMR protocol significantly outperforms the single-qubit approach in preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we employ a neural network model to enhance our analysis of the relationship between different quantum correlation measures during the evolution. Using a MATLAB-based artificial neural network with 80 neurons across three hidden layers and trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we successfully predict trace distance discord from other correlations, achieving low prediction errors. Besides, our analysis of the neural network weights suggests that concurrence and EPR steering have the most positive influence on the accurate discord predictions.</p>

            <p>Quantum circuits can be reduced through optimization to better fit the constraints of quantum hardware. One such method, initial-state dependent optimization (ISDO), reduces gate count by leveraging knowledge of the input quantum states. Surprisingly, we found that ISDO is broadly applicable to the downstream circuits produced by circuit cutting. Circuit cutting also requires measuring upstream qubits and has some flexibility of selection observables to do reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a state-dependent optimization (SDO) framework that incorporates ISDO, our newly proposed measure-state dependent optimization (MSDO), and a biased observable selection strategy. Building on the strengths of the SDO framework and recognizing the scalability challenges of circuit cutting, we propose non-separate circuit cutting-a more flexible approach that enables optimizing gates without fully separating them. We validate our methods on noisy simulations of QAOA, QFT, and BV circuits. Results show that our approach consistently mitigates noise and improves overall circuit performance, demonstrating its promise for enhancing quantum algorithm execution on near-term hardware.</p>

Remarkably, enhancement is maintained across varying numbers of modes with respect to the noise. We further derive a power-law formula predicting performance gains in large-scale systems, including 100-mode and 216-mode configurations. A detailed step-by-step algorithm for implementing the UA protocol is also provided, offering a practical roadmap for advancing near-term quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a powerful tool in quantum science, enabling preparation of non-classical states of light and scalable entanglement of many atoms coupled to a single field mode. While the most coherent atom-photon interactions have been achieved using superconducting millimeter-wave cavities coupled to Rydberg atoms, these platforms so far lack the optical access required for trapping and addressing individual atomic qubits. We present a millimeter-wave Fabry-Pérot cavity with finesse $5.8(1) \times 10^7$ at a temperature of 1 K providing generous transverse optical access (numerical aperture 0.56). Conflicting goals of strong atom-photon coupling and optical access motivate a near-confocal geometry. Close to confocality, however, post-paraxial corrections to the cavity spectrum introduce unexpected degeneracies between transverse modes, leading to excess cavity loss. Modeling these corrections allows for tuning the cavity geometry to evade this loss, producing a high finesse that will enable cavity QED experiments with trapped atoms deep in the strong coupling regime.</p>

With full control over the polarization of the pump, it is possible to create arbitrary states on the surface of the Poincaré sphere. We show that, in agreement with previous theoretical work, there is a remarkable increase in the polarization strength of the condensate above the threshold for a fully linearly polarized pump. Above a certain threshold also the degenerate orthogonal polarized state of the cavity is occupied, limiting the degree of polarization to approximately 90%.</p>

            <p>Quasiparticle condensates are among the most spectacular solid-state manifestations of quantum physics. Coupling macroscopic real-space wave functions to other degrees of freedom, such as the electron spin, could add valuable control knobs for quantum applications. While creating spin-carrying superconducting condensates has attracted enormous attention, man-made condensates of light-matter hybrids known as exciton-polaritons have lacked a comparable spin-related perspective. Here we open a new door by demonstrating exciton-polariton condensation in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr, a van der Waals material with strongly intertwined optical and magnetic properties. Under photoexcitation, CrSBr microwires embedded in an optical cavity show the hallmarks of polariton condensation: a dramatic increase of the emission intensity from an excited laterally confined polariton state by multiple orders of magnitude, spectral narrowing of the emission line, and an intriguing continuous shift of the peak energy. Interferometry evidences an increase of spatial and temporal coherence. The conditions for efficient optical pumping suggest a crucial role of surface excitons and ultrafast polariton-magnon scattering. Our results highlight CrSBr microwires as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable polariton condensates, their directional propagation and their potential for spin-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moiré cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moiré flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.</p>

            <p>Fully automated self-driving laboratories are promising to enable high-throughput and large-scale scientific discovery by reducing repetitive labour. However, effective automation requires deep integration of laboratory knowledge, which is often unstructured, multimodal, and difficult to incorporate into current AI systems. This paper introduces the k-agents framework, designed to support experimentalists in organizing laboratory knowledge and automating experiments with agents. Our framework employs large language model-based agents to encapsulate laboratory knowledge including available laboratory operations and methods for analyzing experiment results. To automate experiments, we introduce execution agents that break multi-step experimental procedures into agent-based state machines, interact with other agents to execute each step and analyze the experiment results. The analyzed results are then utilized to drive state transitions, enabling closed-loop feedback control. To demonstrate its capabilities, we applied the agents to calibrate and operate a superconducting quantum processor, where they autonomously planned and executed experiments for hours, successfully producing and characterizing entangled quantum states at the level achieved by human scientists. Our knowledge-based agent system opens up new possibilities for managing laboratory knowledge and accelerating scientific discovery.</p>

            <h2>Ruling out nonlinear modifications of quantum theory with contextuality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruben Campos Delgado, Martin Plávala</p>
            <p>Nonlinear modifications of quantum theory are considered potential candidates for the theory of quantum gravity, with the intuitive argument that since Einstein field equations are nonlinear, quantum gravity should be nonlinear as well. Contextuality is a property of quantum systems that forbids the explanation of prepare-and-measure experiments in terms of classical hidden variable models with suitable properties. We show that some well-known nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics, namely the Deutsch's map, the Weinberg's model, and the Schrödinger - Newton equation, map a contextual set of states to a non-contextual one. That is, the considered nonlinear modifications of quantum theory allow for the existence of classical hidden variable models for certain experimental setups. This enables us to design experiments that would rule out the considered nonlinear modifications of quantum theory by verifying that the system remains contextual, or, equivalently, our results highlight a mechanism how nonlinear modification of quantum theory may lead to weak wave function collapse and ultimately to the solution of the measurement problem.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement suppression and quantum scars in a three-oscillator gravitational analogue</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. George Christopher, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay)</p>
            <p>We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime, entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space, surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum gravity.</p>

            <p>A positron is equivalent to an electron traveling backward through time. Casting transmon superconducting qubits as akin to electrons, we simulate a positron with a transmon subject to particular resonant and off-resonant drives. We call positron-like transmons "antiqubits." An antiqubit's effective gyromagnetic ratio equals the negative of a qubit's. This fact enables us to time-invert a unitary implemented on a transmon by its environment. We apply this platform-specific unitary inversion, with qubit--antiqubit entanglement, to achieve a quantum advantage in phase estimation: consider measuring the strength of a field that points in an unknown direction. An entangled qubit--antiqubit sensor offers the greatest possible sensitivity (amount of Fisher information), per qubit, per application of the field. We prove this result theoretically and observe it experimentally. This work shows how antimatter, whether real or simulated, can enable platform-specific unitary inversion and benefit quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Detection of Dissipative Quantum Chaos</h2>

            <p>More than four decades of research on chaos in isolated quantum systems have led to the identification of universal signatures -- such as level repulsion and eigenstate thermalization -- that serve as cornerstones in our understanding of complex quantum dynamics. The emerging field of dissipative quantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems, where interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the first experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by measuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems implemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing gradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for chaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum systems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by a sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of the integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an integrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the quantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process. Our results reveal the universal spectral features of dissipative many-body systems and establish present-day quantum computation platforms, which are predominantly used to run unitary simulations, as testbeds to explore dissipative many-body phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Spin-State Selective Excitation in Spin Defects of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h2>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional platform for quantum sensing, due to its optically addressable spin defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy ($V_{\text{B}}^-$). Despite hBN being transferrable to close proximity to samples, spectral overlap of spin transitions due to large hyperfine interactions has limited its magnetic sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate spin-selective excitation of $V_{\text{B}}^-$ spin defects in hBN driven by circularly polarized microwave. Using a cross-shaped microwave resonance waveguide, we superimpose two orthogonally linearly polarized microwave shifted in phase from a RFSoC FPGA to generate circularly polarized microwaves. This enables selective spin $|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ or $|0\rangle\rightarrow|1\rangle$ excitation of $V_{\text{B}}^-$ defects, as confirmed by optically detected magnetic resonance experimentally and supported computationally. We also investigate the influence of magnetic field on spin-state selectivity. Our technique enhances the potential of hBN platform for quantum sensing through better spin state control and magnetic sensitivity particularly at low fields.</p>

            <p>The quantum state of ultracold atoms is often determined through measurement of the spatial distribution of the atom cloud. Absorption imaging of the cloud is regularly used to extract this spatial information. Accurate determination of the parameters which describe the spatial distribution of the cloud is crucial to the success of many ultracold atom applications. In this work, we present modified deep learning image classification models for image regression. To overcome challenges in data collection, we train the model on simulated absorption images. We compare the performance of the deep learning models to least-squares techniques and show that the deep learning models achieve accuracy similar to least-squares, while consuming significantly less computation time. We compare the performance of models which take a single atom image against models which use an atom image plus other images that contain background information, and find that both models achieved similar accuracy. The use of single image models will enable single-exposure absorption imaging, which simplifies experiment design and eases imaging hardware requirements.</p>

            <p>Quantum technologies promise profound advances in communication security, sensing and computing. The underpinning hardware must be engineered to generate, manipulate and detect quantum phenomena with exceptional performance, whilst being mass-manufacturable for real-world applications. A leading approach is chip-scale quantum photonics. The continuous-variable regime for quantum optics has been exploited in a number of technologies, including the detection of gravitational waves, by operating below the standard quantum limit of the light's shot noise. The availability of room-temperature, deterministic sources and high efficiency detectors suitable for continuous-variable state generation and measurement is a compelling motivation for this particular paradigm. This review focusses on efforts to integrate sources and detectors of continuous-variable light states into chip-scale photonic integrated circuits.</p>

            <p>Quantum-classical transitions have long attracted much attention. We study such transitions in quantum spin-($j$,1/2) systems at thermal equilibrium. Unlike previous papers, it is found that the threshold temperature of quantum entanglement decreases with increasing spin $j$ and completely disappears in the limit $j\to\infty$. In the ground state of systems with highly symmetric interactions, the discord-type quantum correlations can exist even for arbitrarily large spin. Such correlations turn out to be unstable and are destroyed by small perturbations that violate the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The stable quantum correlations gradually degrade as the spin $j$ grows and eventually vanish when the classical limit is reached.</p>

            <h2>Engineering Quantum-Enhanced Transport by Supertransfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adesh Kushwaha, Ivan Kassal</p>
            <p>Collective behaviour of the components of a quantum system can significantly alter the rates of dynamical processes within the system. A paradigmatic collective effect is superradiance, the enhancement in the rate that radiation is emitted by a group of emitters relative to that emitted by independent emitters. Less studied are collective effects in energy transport, notably supertransfer, the enhancement of the rate of energy transfer from donors to acceptors due to delocalised excitations. Despite its proposed significance in photosynthesis, there has been no direct experimental detection of supertransfer because, in biological or molecular systems, delocalisation cannot be turned on and off to evaluate its effect on energy transfer. Here, we show that supertransfer could be directly observed using a quantum device based on a superconducting circuit. The programmability and control offered by an engineered device would allow controllable delocalisation of quantum states, giving full tunability over supertransfer. Our guidelines for engineering supertransfer could inform the design of future quantum-enhanced light harvesters.</p>

            <p>Repeated quantum non-demolition measurement is a cornerstone of quantum error correction protocols. In superconducting qubits, the speed of dispersive state readout can be enhanced by increasing the power of the readout tone. However, such an increase has been found to result in additional qubit state transitions that violate the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Recently, the readout of a transmon superconducting qubit was improved by using a tone with frequency much larger than the qubit frequency. Here, we experimentally identify the mechanisms of readout-induced transitions in this regime. In the dominant mechanism, the energy of an incoming readout photon is partially absorbed by the transmon and partially returned to the transmission line as a photon with lower frequency. Other mechanisms involve the excitation of unwanted package modes, decay via material defects, and, at higher qubit frequencies, the activation of undesired resonances in the transmon spectrum. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of superconducting qubit state transitions caused by a strong drive.</p>

            <p>We present a superconducting qubit which consists of two strongly coupled modes: one for data storage and one for coupling, allowing faster, higher-fidelity entangling gates and readout. The use of a dedicated coupling mode allows nonlinear couplings of several hundred MHz between the data mode and other elements, with minimal linear coupling to the data mode. Including decoherence, simulations show that this architecture enables microwave-only CZ gates with an infidelity of $8.6\times10^{-5}$ in 17 ns and always-on ZZ interaction less than 0.4 kHz. Numerical simulations also show readout with state assignment error of $1\times10^{-4}$ in 27 ns (assuming quantum efficiency $\eta=0.5$), Purcell-limited lifetime of 167 ms without a Purcell filter, and a mechanism to suppress shot-noise dephasing ($1/\Gamma_{\phi}=15.8$ ms). Single-qubit gate infidelities are below $1\times10^{-5}$ including decoherence. These beyond experimental state-of-the-art gate and readout fidelities rely only on capacitive coupling between arm qubits, making the arm qubit a promising scalable building block for fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent gravity gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing.

            <p>Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that clearly indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence.</p>

            <p>Nanoporous graphene (NPG) has been fabricated by on-surface-self assembly in the form of arrays of apporx. 1 nm-wide graphene nanoribbons connected via molecular bridges in a two-dimensional crystal lattice. It is predicted that NPG may, despite its molecular structure, work as electron waveguides that display e.g. Talbot wave interference. Here, we demonstrate how the electronic wave guidance may be controlled by the use of electrical fields transverse to the ribbons; at low fields, point injected currents display spatially periodic patterns along the ribbons, while high fields localize the injected current to single ribbons. This behavior constitutes an electronic version of optical breathing modes of Bloch oscillations, providing a simple mechanism for controlling the current patterns down to the molecular scale. The robustness of the self-repeating patterns under disorder demonstrate that the breathing modes of single-ribbon injections offer exciting opportunities for applications in nanoelectronics, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We investigate High-harmonic generation (HHG) in a dimerized Kitaev chain. The dimerization in the model is introduced through a site-dependent modulating potential, determined by a parameter $\lambda \in [-1:1]$. This parameter also determines the strength of the hopping amplitudes and tunes the system's topology. Depending upon the parameter $\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can be classified into three segments. The first segment exhibits two plateau structures, with the dominant one resulting from transitions to the chiral partner state, consistent with quasiparticle behavior in the topological superconducting phase. The second segment displays multiple plateaus, where intermediate states enable various transition pathways to higher conduction bands. Finally, the third segment presents broader plateaus, indicative of active interband transitions. In the $\lambda\leq0$ regime, we observe the mid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed harmonic enhancements. This highlights the key role of the intermediate states, particularly when MGSs are isolated. These results demonstrate that harmonic emission profiles can be selectively controlled through the modulating parameter $\lambda$, offering new prospects for tailoring HHG in topological systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Augustino, Giacomo Nannicini, Tamás Terlaky, Luis Zuluaga</p>
            <p>Recent works on quantum algorithms for solving semidefinite optimization (SDO) problems have leveraged a quantum-mechanical interpretation of positive semidefinite matrices to develop methods that obtain quantum speedups with respect to the dimension $n$ and number of constraints $m$. While their dependence on other parameters suggests no overall speedup over classical methodologies, some quantum SDO solvers provide speedups in the low-precision regime. We exploit this fact to our advantage, and present an iterative refinement scheme for the Hamiltonian Updates algorithm of Brandão et al. (Quantum 6, 625 (2022)) to exponentially improve the dependence of their algorithm on precision. As a result, we obtain a classical algorithm to solve the semidefinite relaxation of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems (QUBOs) in matrix multiplication time. Provided access to a quantum read/classical write random access memory (QRAM), a quantum implementation of our algorithm exhibits a worst case running time of $\mathcal{O} \left(ns + n^{1.5} \cdot \text{polylog} \left(n, \| C \|_F, \frac{1}{\epsilon} \right) \right)$.</p>

            <p>Correlated errors may devastate quantum error corrections that are necessary for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Recent experiments with superconducting qubits indicate that they can arise from quasiparticle (QP) bursts induced by cosmic-ray muons and {\gamma}-rays. Here, we use charge-parity jump and bit flip for monitoring QP bursts and two muon detectors in the dilution refrigerator for detecting muon events. We directly observe QP bursts leading to correlated errors that are induced solely by muons and separate the contributions of muons and {\gamma}-rays. We further investigate the dynamical process of QP burst and the impact of QP trapping on correlated errors and particle detection. The proposed method, which monitors multiqubit simultaneous charge-parity jumps, has high sensitivity to QP burst and may find applications for the detection of cosmic-ray particles, low-mass dark matter, and far-infrared photons.</p>

            <h2>Low Overhead Qutrit Magic State Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiroman Prakash, Tanay Saha</p>
            <p>We show that using qutrits rather than qubits leads to a substantial reduction in the overhead cost associated with an approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing known as magic state distillation. We construct a family of $[[9m-k, k, 2]]_3$ triorthogonal qutrit error-correcting codes for any positive integers $m$ and $k$ with $k \leq 3m-2$ that are suitable for magic state distillation. In magic state distillation, the number of ancillae required to produce a magic state with target error rate $\epsilon$ is $O(\log^\gamma \epsilon^{-1})$, where the yield parameter $\gamma$ characterizes the overhead cost. For $k=3m-2$, our codes have $\gamma = \log_2 (2+\frac{6}{3 m-2})$, which tends to $1$ as $m \to \infty$. Moreover, the $[[20,7,2]]_3$ qutrit code that arises from our construction when $m=3$ already has a yield parameter of $1.51$ which outperforms all known qubit triorthogonal codes of size less than a few hundred qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenfeng Cao, Filippo Maria Gambetta, Ashley Montanaro, Raul A. Santos</p>
            <p>Understanding quantum phase transitions in physical systems is fundamental to characterize their behavior at low temperatures. Achieving this requires both accessing good approximations to the ground state and identifying order parameters to distinguish different phases. Addressing these challenges, our work introduces a hybrid algorithm that combines quantum optimization with classical machine learning. This approach leverages the capability of near-term quantum computers to prepare locally trapped states through finite optimization. Specifically, we apply LASSO for identifying conventional phase transitions and the Transformer model for topological transitions, utilizing these with a sliding window scan of Hamiltonian parameters to learn appropriate order parameters and locate critical points. We validated the method with numerical simulations and real-hardware experiments on Rigetti's Ankaa 9Q-1 quantum computer. This protocol provides a framework for investigating quantum phase transitions with shallow circuits, offering enhanced efficiency and, in some settings, higher precision-thus contributing to the broader effort to integrate near-term quantum computing and machine learning.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermiticity can lead to the emergence of many intriguing phenomena that are absent in Hermitian systems, enabled by exceptional topological defects, among which Weyl exceptional rings (WER) are particularly interesting. The topology of a WER can be characterized by the quantized Berry phase and a nonzero Chern number, both encoded in the eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. So far, WERs have been realized with classical wave systems, whose eigenvectors can be well described by classical physics. We here report the first quantum-mechanical implementation of WERs and investigate the related topology transitions. The experiment system consists of a superconducting qubit and a dissipative resonator, coupled to each other. The high flexibility of the system enables us to characterize its eigenvectors on different manifolds of parameter space, each of which corresponds to a quantum-mechanical entangled state. We extract both the quantized Berry phase and Chern number from these eigenvectors, and demonstrate the topological transition triggered by shrinking the size of the manifold.</p>

            <p>Vibronic interactions between nuclear motion and electronic states are critical for the accurate modeling of photochemistry. However, accurate simulations of fully quantum non-adiabatic dynamics are often prohibitively expensive for classical methods beyond small systems. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm based on product formulas for simulating time evolution under a general vibronic Hamiltonian in real space, capable of handling an arbitrary number of electronic states and vibrational modes. We develop the first trotterization scheme for vibronic Hamiltonians beyond two electronic states and introduce an array of optimization techniques for the exponentiation of each fragment in the product formula, resulting in a remarkably low cost of implementation. To demonstrate practical relevance, we outline a proof-of-principle integration of our algorithm into a materials discovery pipeline for designing more efficient singlet fission-based organic solar cells. We estimate that $100$ femtoseconds of propagation using a second-order Trotter product formula for a $6$-state, $21$-mode model of exciton transport at an anthracene dimer requires $154$ qubits and $2.76 \times 10^6$ Toffoli gates. While a $4$-state, $246$-mode model describing charge transfer at an anthracene-fullerene interface requires $1053$ qubits and $2.66 \times 10^7$ Toffoli gates.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</p>

            <p>Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge-neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ (bosonic) \updated{ and $1/3$ (fermionic) fractional Chern insulator (FCI)} on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor acquires a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. As the system approaches the FCI-to-CDW transition point, we observe a pronounced sharpening of the roton mode, suggesting that the magnetoroton behaves more like a quasiparticle as it softens. Notably, this occurs while the single-particle gap remains finite. Besides the magnetoroton at finite momentum, we also construct quadrupolar chiral operators in a discrete lattice and resolve the chiral graviton mode around the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we show the different chiralities of the gravitons of FCIs with opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Maisel Licerán, H. T. C. Stoof</p>
            <p>Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between 50 K and 75 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</p>

            <p>We propose a cavity-mediated gate between two transmon qubits or other nonlinear superconducting elements. The gate is realized by driving both qubits at a frequency that is near-resonant with the frequency of the cavity. Since both qubits are subject to a cross-resonant drive, we call this gate a cross-cross-resonance gate. In close analogy with gates between trapped-ion qubits, in phase space, the state of the cavity makes a circle whose area depends on the state of the two qubits, realizing a controlled-phase gate. We propose two schemes for canceling the dominant error, which is the dispersive coupling. We also show that this cross-cross-resonance gate allows one to realize simultaneous gates between multiple pairs of qubits coupled via the same metamaterial composed of an array of coupled cavities or other linear mediators.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times and large accessible Hilbert spaces, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with coherence-limited fidelities reaching up to 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.</p>

This enhanced interaction enables us to detect the weak field through monitoring the motion of the particle, with sensitivity down to 79 pW/Hz. We discuss the potential of this approach for realizing an ultrasensitive, nondestructive light field detector and for exploring optomechanical interactions at the single-photon level.</p>

            <p>Memory, understood as time non-locality, is a fundamental property of any physical system, whether classical or quantum, and has important applications in a wide variety of technologies. In the context of quantum technologies, systems with memory can be used in quantum information, communication, and sensing.

By engineering the adiabatic and non-adiabatic pulses, particularly the Gaussian and sinusoidal, we induce and control diverse memory phenomena such as dynamical hysteresis, quantized phononic transitions, and distinct energy-storing responses. Within a mean-field approach, we derive the analytical and numerical criteria under which the photonic and phononic observables manifest the memory effects in strongly driven regimes. The memory effects are quantified through a dimensionless geometric form factor, which provides a versatile metric to characterize the memory efficiency. Our protocol is readily compatible with the current optomechanical platforms, highlighting the new possibilities for advanced memory functionalities in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are among the most promising quantum algorithms for solving electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry, particularly during the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this study, we investigate the capabilities and limitations of VQE algorithms implemented on current quantum hardware for determining molecular ground-state energies, focusing on the adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter ansatz VQE (ADAPT-VQE). To address the significant computational challenges posed by molecular Hamiltonians, we explore various strategies to simplify the Hamiltonian, optimize the ansatz, and improve classical parameter optimization through modifications of the COBYLA optimizer. These enhancements are integrated into a tailored quantum computing implementation designed to minimize the circuit depth and computational cost. Using benzene as a benchmark system, we demonstrate the application of these optimizations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite these improvements, our results highlight the limitations imposed by current quantum hardware, particularly the impact of quantum noise on state preparation and energy measurement. The noise levels in today's devices prevent meaningful evaluations of molecular Hamiltonians with sufficient accuracy to produce reliable quantum chemical insights. Finally, we extrapolate the requirements for future quantum hardware to enable practical and scalable quantum chemistry calculations using VQE algorithms.

We construct the effective Hamiltonian for the vortex system and implement a spatiotemporal evolution circuit to simulate its dynamics over prolonged periods. By leveraging eight qubits on a superconducting quantum processor with gate fidelities of 99.97\% for single-qubit gates and 99.76\% for two-qubit gates, we successfully reproduce natural vortex interactions. This method bridges classical fluid dynamics and quantum computing, offering a novel computational platform for studying vortex dynamics.

            <p>In quantum chemistry, self-consistent field (SCF) algorithms define a nonlinear optimization problem, with both continuous and discrete components. In this work, we derive Hartree-Fock-inspired SCF algorithms that can be exactly written as a sequence of Quadratic Unconstrained Spin/Binary Optimization problems (QUSO/QUBO). We reformulate the optimization problem as a series of MaxCut graph problems, which can be efficiently solved using semi-definite programming techniques. This procedure provides performance guarantees at each SCF step, irrespective of the complexity of the optimization landscape. We numerically demonstrate the QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF methods by studying the hydroxide anion OH- and molecular Nitrogen N2. The largest problem addressed in this study involves a system comprised of 220 qubits (equivalently, spin-orbitals). Our results show that QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF suffer much less from internal instabilities compared with conventional SCF calculations. Additionally, we show that the new SCF algorithms can enhance single-reference methods, such as configuration interaction. Finally, we explore how quantum algorithms for optimization can be applied to the QUSO problems arising from the Hartree-Fock method. Four distinct hybrid-quantum classical approaches are introduced: GAS-SCF, QAOA-SCF, QA-SCF and DQI-SCF.</p>

            <p>We discuss recent progress in the study of entanglement within cosmological frameworks, focusing on both momentum and position-space approaches and also reviewing the possibility to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields. Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.</p>

            <p>The rapid development of quantum computers has enabled demonstrations of quantum advantages on various tasks. However, real quantum systems are always dissipative due to their inevitable interaction with the environment, and the resulting non-unitary dynamics make quantum simulation challenging with only unitary quantum gates. In this work, we present an innovative and scalable method to simulate open quantum systems using quantum computers. We define an adjoint density matrix as a counterpart of the true density matrix, which reduces to a mixed-unitary quantum channel and thus can be effectively sampled using quantum computers. This method has several benefits, including no need for auxiliary qubits and noteworthy scalability. Moreover, some long-time properties like steady states and the thermal equilibrium can also be investigated as the adjoint density matrix and the true dissipated one converge to the same state. Finally, we present deployments of this theory in the dissipative quantum $XY$ model for the evolution of correlation and entropy with short-time dynamics and the disordered Heisenberg model for many-body localization with long-time dynamics. This work promotes the study of real-world many-body dynamics with quantum computers, highlighting the potential to demonstrate practical quantum advantages.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors based on critical many-body systems are known to exhibit enhanced sensing capability. Such enhancements typically scale algebraically with the probe size. Going beyond algebraic advantage and reaching exponential scaling has remained elusive when all the resources, such as the preparation time, are taken into account. In this work, we show that many-body systems featuring first order quantum phase transitions can indeed achieve exponential scaling of sensitivity, thanks to their exponential energy gap closing. Remarkably, even after considering the preparation time using local adiabatic driving, the exponential scaling is sustained. Our results are demonstrated through comprehensive analysis of three paradigmatic models exhibiting first order phase transitions, namely Grover, $p$-spin, and biclique models. We show that this scaling survives moderate decoherence during state preparation and also can be optimally measured in experimentally available basis. Our findings comply with the fundamental bounds and we show that one can harness the exponential advantage through an adaptive strategy even away from the phase transition point.</p>

            <h2>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang</p>
            <p>The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Baydin, Hanyu Zhu, Motoaki Bamba, Kaden Hazzard, Junichiro Kono</p>
            <p>An intriguing consequence of quantum field theory is that vacuum is not empty space; it is full of quantum fluctuating electromagnetic fields, or virtual photons, corresponding to their zero-point energy, even though the average number of photons is zero. These short-lived vacuum fluctuations are behind some of the most fascinating physical processes in the universe, including spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, and the Casimir force. Recent theory and experiments indicate that the properties of materials placed in photonic cavities may be altered, even in the complete absence of any external fields, through interaction with the fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic fields. Judicious engineering of the quantum vacuum surrounding the matter inside a cavity can lead to significant and nonintuitive modifications of electronic and vibrational states, producing a ``vacuum dressed'' material. These exciting new ideas have stimulated discussions regarding the fundamental physics of vacuum-matter interactions and also broadened the scope of potential applications using zero-point fluctuations to engineer materials. This Perspective will first discuss recent experimental and theoretical developments on vacuum-modified condensed matter systems, which usually require the realization of the so-called ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime. Then, we will overview some of the most promising cavity designs for enhancing vacuum electromagnetic fields in materials with various energy scales. Finally, we will discuss urgent open questions and technical challenges to be solved in this emerging field.</p>

            <h2>Spin Grouping in Ring Cavity and its Protection on Entangled States Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang Li</p>
            <p>Long-range interactions are essential for large-scale quantum computation and quantum interconnections. Cavities provide a promising avenue to achieve long-range interaction by enhancing the coupling of remote qubits through shared cavity modes. In this work, we investigate a spin array coupled to a ring cavity supporting two counterpropagating modes, focusing on the system's eigenstates and spin dynamics in the low-excitation regime. We show that, under specific spatial configurations, the spins naturally self-organize into two groups, within which exciton transport is confined. This spin-grouping mechanism preserves coherence between spins across the two groups, and is leveraged to deterministically transfer entangled states between remote spin pairs with additional dynamical addressing. We further propose feasible implementations using atomic qubits or solid-state platforms. Our scheme enables entangling remote spins within a cavity, highlighting potential applications in scalable quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We have theoretically investigated an optomechanical system and presented the scenario of significantly enhanced bipartite photon-phonon entanglement for two qubits coupled to the single mode of the cavity. And results are compared with the one qubit case for reference.

Furthermore, we have studied the phenomenon of hyperradiance in which the well-known Dicke superradiant ($N^2$ scaling law) can be surpassed due to the inter-atomic correlations. Jointly, a parameter regime is explored to observe the entanglement of photon-phonon pairs and their hyperradiance simultaneously. As it is important to show that the generation of photons and phonons are antibunched, the equal time second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ is characterized as witness. This system can be realized in Circuit Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CCQED) in which the direct coupling of the atom and mechanical resonator is this http URL have theoretically investigated an optomechanical system and presented the scenario of significantly enhanced bipartite photon-phonon entanglement for two qubits coupled to the single mode of the cavity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuan Zuo, Zi-Xu Lu, Shi-Yao Zhu, Jie Li</p>
            <p>The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two different configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which makes it possible to prepare and control mechanical states via manipulating the polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and show how multiple mechanical modes can be simultaneously cooled by using polaritons with a single drive field. This is achieved by exploiting the great tunability of the polariton frequencies. Specifically, $N$ polaritons can be tuned to resonantly enhance the anti-Stokes scatterings associated with $N$ mechanical modes, leading to the cooling of all the mechanical modes at once. We explicitly show how such polaromechanical cooling can simultaneously cool two mechanical modes, and then discuss how to apply it to cool multiple mechanical modes and to various polaromechanical systems, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems.</p>

            <p>Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for the development of quantum repeaters and resource-efficient quantum processors. We report the experimental realization of a novel architecture of superconducting random access quantum memory with cycling storage time, achieved through pulsed control of an RF-SQUID coupling element. The device demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and achieves 57.5\% fidelity with preservation of the input pulse shape during the first retrieval interval for near-single-photon level excitations, with subsequent exponential decay characterized by a time constant of 11.44 $\mu s$. This performance represents a several-fold improvement over previously reported implementations. Crucially, we establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching imperfections. These results highlight the potential of proposed architecture for quantum memory applications while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Internet is key for distributed quantum computing, by interconnecting multiple quantum processors into a virtual quantum computation system. This allows to scale the number of qubits, by overcoming the inherent limitations of noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Thus, the Quantum Internet is the foundation for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Among the distributed architectures, Quantum Data Centers emerge as the most viable in the medium-term, since they integrate multiple quantum processors within a localized network infrastructure, by allowing modular design of quantum networking. We analyze the physical and topological constraints of Quantum Data Centers, by emphasizing the role of entanglement orchestrators in dynamically reconfiguring network topologies through local operations. We examine the major hardware challenge of quantum transduction, essential for interfacing heterogeneous quantum systems. Furthermore, we explore how interconnecting multiple Quantum Data Centers could enable large-scale quantum networks. We discuss the topological constraints of such a scaling and identify open challenges, including entanglement routing and synchronization. The carried analysis positions Quantum Data Centers as both a practical implementation platform and strategic framework for the future Quantum Internet.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minwei Shi, Guzhi Bao, Jinxian Guo, Weiping Zhang</p>
            <p>Exceptional points (EPs), which arose early from non-Hermitian physics, significantly amplify the system's response to minor perturbations, and they act as a useful concept to enhance measurement in metrology. In particular, such a metrological enhancement grows dramatically with the EP's order. However, the Langevin noises intrinsically existing in the non-Hermitian systems diminish this enhancement. In this study, we propose a protocol for quantum metrology with the construction of higher-order EPs (HOEPs) in an atom-cavity system through Hermitian magnon-photon interaction. The construction of HOEPs utilizes the atom-cavity non-Hermitian-like dynamical behavior but avoids the external Langevin noises via the Hermitian interaction. A general analysis is exhibited for the construction of arbitrary -order EP (EPn). As a demonstration of the superiority of these HOEPs in quantum metrology, we work out an EP3/4-based atomic sensor with sensitivity being orders of magnitude higher than that achievable in an EP2-based atomic sensor. We further unveil the mechanism behind the sensitivity enhancement from HOEPs. The experimental establishment for this proposal is suggested with potential candidates. This EP-based atomic sensor, taking advantage of the atom-light interface, offers new insight into quantum metrology with HOEPs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroki Takeda, Takahiro Tanaka</p>
            <p>The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range $100\ {\rm Hz} \text{-} 10^8\ {\rm Hz}$, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above $10^7\ {\rm Hz}$.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement for Pattern Learning in Temporal Data with Logarithmic Complexity: Benchmarking on IBM Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafizur Rahaman Laskar, Richa Goel</p>
            <p>Time series forecasting is foundational in scientific and technological domains, from climate modelling to molecular dynamics. Classical approaches have significantly advanced sequential prediction, including autoregressive models and deep learning architectures such as temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and Transformers. Yet, they remain resource-intensive and often scale poorly in data-limited or hardware-constrained settings. We propose a quantum-native time series forecasting framework that harnesses entanglement-based parameterized quantum circuits to learn temporal dependencies. Our Quantum Time Series (QTS) model encodes normalized sequential data into single-qubit rotations and embeds temporal structure through structured entanglement patterns. This design considers predictive performance with logarithmic complexity in training data and parameter count. We benchmark QTS against classical models on synthetic and real-world datasets, including geopotential height fields used in numerical weather prediction. Experiments on the noisy backend and real IBM quantum hardware demonstrate that QTS can capture temporal patterns using fewer data points. Hardware benchmarking results establish quantum entanglement as a practical computational resource for temporal modelling, with potential near-term applications in nano-scale systems, quantum sensor networks, and other forecasting scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piotr Sierant, Paolo Stornati, Xhek Turkeshi</p>
            <p>Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.</p>

Our focus is on the single-qubit version of QPE namely, the Hadamard test applied to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) ansatz. We demonstrate that a mid-circuit measurement acts as a low- energy filter when the desired outcome is obtained. When the other outcome is measured we heuristically rely on the mixer to repopulate the low energy states. Numerical simulations show that this method effectively amplifies the ground state. We validate our approach on real quantum hardware namely the IBM Quantum system one ibm quebec.</p>

            <h2>Productionizing Quantum Mass Production</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William J. Huggins, Tanuj Khattar, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>For many practical applications of quantum computing, the most costly steps involve coherently accessing classical data. We help address this challenge by applying mass production techniques, which can reduce the cost of applying an operation multiple times in parallel. We combine these techniques with modern approaches for classical data loading based on "quantum read-only memory" (QROM). We find that we can polynomially reduce the total number of gates required for data loading, but we find no advantage in cost models that only count the number of non-Clifford gates. Furthermore, for realistic cost models and problem sizes, we find that it is possible to reduce the cost of parallel data loading by an order of magnitude or more. We present several applications of quantum mass production, including a scheme that uses parallel phase estimation to asymptotically reduce the gate complexity of state-of-the-art algorithms for estimating eigenvalues of the quantum chemical Hamiltonian, including both Clifford and non-Clifford gates, from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(N_{orb}^2\right)$ to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(N_{orb}^{\log_2 3}\right)$, where $N_{orb}$ denotes the number of orbitals. We also show that mass production can be used to reduce the cost of serial calls to the same data loading oracle by precomputing several copies of a novel QROM resource state.</p>

            <p>Decoherence in superconducting qubits is dominated by defects that reside at amorphous interfaces. Interaction with discrete defects results in dropouts that complicate qubit operation and lead to nongaussian tails in the distribution of qubit energy relaxation time $T_1$ that degrade system performance. Spectral diffusion of defects over time leads to fluctuations in $T_1$, posing a challenge for calibration. In this work, we measure the energy relaxation of flux-tunable transmons over a range of operating frequencies. We vary qubit geometry to change the interface participation ratio by more than an order of magnitude. Our results are consistent with loss dominated by discrete interfacial defects. Moreover, we are able to localize the dominant defects to within 500 nm of the qubit junctions, where residues from liftoff are present. These results motivate new approaches to qubit junction fabrication that avoid the residues intrinsic to the liftoff process.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation of the interactions of fermions and bosons -- the fundamental particles of nature -- is essential for modeling complex quantum systems in material science, chemistry and high-energy physics and has been proposed as a promising application of fermion-boson quantum computers, which overcome the overhead encountered in mapping fermions and bosons to qubits. However, compiling the simulation of specific fermion-boson Hamiltonians into the natively available fermion-boson gate set is challenging. In particular, the large local dimension of bosons renders matrix-based compilation methods, as used for qubits and in existing tools such as Bosonic Qiskit or OpenFermion, challenging. We overcome this issue by introducing a novel symbolic compiler based on matrix-free symbolic manipulation of second quantised Hamiltonians, which automates the decomposition of fermion-boson second quantized problems into qubit-boson instruction set architectures. This integration establishes a comprehensive pipeline for simulating quantum systems on emerging qubit-boson and fermion-boson hardware, paving the way for their large-scale usage.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the emergence of chaotic dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) subjected to both alternating (AC) and constant (DC) components of the interaction strength, modeled through the scattering length. We systematically explore how the interplay of AC and DC nonlinearities affect the dynamical evolution of the condensate under a tilted optical lattice potential. Various types of chaos are identified across different parametric regimes, with numerical simulations revealing a clear distinction between regular and chaotic domains. The width of the regular domains is quantified, and the influence of AC and DC components in promoting stochastic behavior is highlighted. Lyapunov exponents, Poincaré sections, and other chaos indicators then confirm the transition to chaotic dynamics, in agreement with analytical expectations. A qualitative conjecture is proposed for the role of these interactions in BEC stabilization. Our findings offer insights into the dynamic control of BECs, with potential applications in quantum simulation and coherent matter-wave engineering, in line with entanglement and quantum transport, that are crucial for developing robust and reliable quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Realizing strong interactions between individual photons is a cornerstone for advancing photonic quantum computing and quantum nonlinear optics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate strong interactions between counter-propagating photons mediated by Rydberg polaritons, achieving a record-long anti-correlation range exceeding $1~\mu s$. This extended range enables the use of photon pulses that are long enough to fit within the polariton bandwidth, yet short enough to remain within the interaction range. Under these conditions, we observe complete photon blockade of entire pulses, tunable by the pulse timing, thus demonstrating the potential for controlled, deterministic operations. Extending to the three-photon regime, we observe enhanced interactions when a photon encounters two counter-propagating photons. Our results, supported by analytical theory and rigorous numerical simulations, establish counter-propagating Rydberg polaritons as a powerful platform for engineering interactions in quantum light fields.</p>

We demonstrate that the dynamical interaction potential is nonzero prior to the radiation, which is generated by the gravitational vacuum-fluctuation-induced mass quadrupole of the object, being reflected by the gravitational boundary and back-reacted to the object (i.e., the mirror image of the object lies outside its causal region). This indicates the nonlocality of the fluctuating gravitational field in vacuum and calls for a reevaluation of the inherent causality within the interaction. Moreover, the dynamical gravitational Casimir-Polder interaction can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the distance of the object with respect to the boundary and the time of interaction. When the interaction time is sufficiently long for the system to approach asymptotic equilibrium, the dynamical gravitational Casimir-Polder interaction potential reduces to the static one, which is time-independent and consistently repulsive in both the near and far regimes.</p>

            <h2>Observation of effects of inter-atomic interaction on Autler-Townes splitting in cold Rydberg atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silpa B S, Shovan Kanti Barik, Varna Shenoy, Soham Chandak, Rejish Nath, Sanjukta Roy</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the effect of inter-atomic interaction in highly excited Rydberg atoms via Autler- Townes splitting in cold atoms. We measure the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting of the 5S1/2, F=2 to 5P3/2, F'=3 transition of 87Rb atoms arising due to the strong coupling of the transition via the cooling beams used for the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The AT splitting is probed using a weakly coupled transition from 5P3/2, F'=3 state to highly excited Rydberg states for a wide range of principal quantum numbers (n = 35 - 117). We observe the AT splitting via trap-loss spectroscopy in the MOT by scanning the probe frequency. We observe a drastic increase in the broadening of the AT splitting signal as a result of interaction-induced dephasing effect in cold Rydberg atoms for highly excited Rydberg states with principal quantum number n > 100. We explain our observations using theoretical modelling and numerical simulations based on the Lindblad Master equation. We find a good agreement of the results of the numerical simulation with the experimental measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi</p>
            <p>Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomáš Novák, Martin Guldan, Josef Vojtěch, Josef Blažej</p>
            <p>Commercial sources of polarization entanglement at telecommunication wavelengths are already available on the market, but they lack proper certification or third-party testing. We aim to provide a comprehensive testing framework for photon counting and correlation measurements to characterize the parameters of these sources in a scalable and repeatable manner. The detection setup is included in our considerations, as the non-idealities of the components negatively affect the relevance of the measurement results. We discuss bounds for both true and false coincidences with rigorous probabilistic approach, as their ratio directly impacts the resolution of coincidence measurements and is reflected in Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) in the quantum telecommunication system. Quantum State Tomography (QST), polarization visibility measurements, temporal correlations measurements, and computations of other statistics are to be performed and compared at the state-of-the-art level for a three commercially available sources. Given that QST is demanding in terms of number of measurements and post-processing analysis, we discuss the relevance of determining the degree of polarization entanglement considering solely other statistics of direct measurement approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomáš Novák, Carlos Guerra-Yánez, Matěj Holubička, Josef Vojtěch, Josef Blažej</p>
            <p>Polarization-sensitive receivers for single photons are of crucial importance in various applications within the fields of quantum communication and quantum sensing, and are more commonly implemented in free-space optics rather than in optical fibers. This is primarily due to the unpredictable and varying birefringence in single-mode optical fibers. We present a method for birefringence compensation in an all-fiber detection setup that relies solely on coincidence measurements of a polarization-entangled state, or known correlations in a prepare-and-measure scenario. We define coincidence entropies as functions of the measured coincidence counts. These quantify the randomness of measurement outcomes, remain independent of the transmitted Bell state, and serve as indicators of the degree of entanglement. By leveraging coincidence entropy as a cost function in a gradient descent algorithm, we are able to align the polarization bases between two distinct polarization-sensitive receivers. Additionally, coincidence entropies can be employed to monitor the quality of entanglement transmission, thereby enhancing the system's ability to detect potential eavesdropping attempts, such as intercept-resend quantum attacks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Mendicino, Franco Mayo, Christian Schmiegelow, Augusto Roncaglia</p>
            <p>We investigate the improvement of anti-Stokes laser cooling of a Yb$^{3+}$:YLF nanocrystal in a Fabry-Pérot microcavity via the Purcell effect. Our analysis accounts for both the enhancement of emission lines resonant with the cavity transmission and the suppression of off-resonance emissions. Using a quantum-mechanical framework, we modeled the Yb$^{3+}$ ions in a YLiF$_4$ matrix and the laser system to calculate the minimum achievable temperature and cooling efficiency, incorporating cavity-induced modifications to experimental data on emission cross section. Our results indicate that for temperatures below 100~K, the cooling efficiency ($\eta_c$) is consistently enhanced, and the minimum achievable temperature is reduced comfortably below the current limits. We also show how the inclusion of Purcell inhibition effects can lead to improvements in the cooling efficiency ranging from 25\% to 65\%, with respect to the case when only Purcell enhancement is considered.</p>

            <p>The permutation symmetry is a fundamental attribute of the collective wavefunction of indistinguishable particles. It makes a difference for the behavior of collective systems having different quantum statistics but existing in the same environment. Here we show that for some specific quantum conjugation between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom the indistinguishable particles can behave similarly for either quantum statistics. In particular, a mesoscopically scaled collection of atomic qubits, mediated by optical tweezers, can model the behavior of a valent electronic shell compounded with nuclear centers in molecules. This makes possible quantum simulations of mono and divalent bonds in quantum chemistry by manipulation of up to four bosonic atoms confined with optical microtraps.</p>

            <p>Entanglement detection serves as a fundamental task in quantum information science, playing a critical role in quantum benchmarking and foundational studies. As the number of controllable qubits continues to increase, there emerges a pressing demand for scalable and robust entanglement detection protocols that can maintain high detection capability while requiring minimal resources. By integrating the positive partial transposition criterion with variational quantum interference, we develop an entanglement detection protocol that requires moderate classical and quantum computation resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this protocol attains high detection capability using only shallow quantum circuits, outperforming several widely-used entanglement detection methods. The protocol also exhibits strong resilience to circuit noise, ensuring its applicability across different physical platforms. Experimental implementation on a linear optical platform successfully identifies entanglement in a three-qubit mixed state that cannot be detected by conventional entanglement witnesses. Drawing upon the full potential of quantum and classical resources, our protocol paves a new path for efficient entanglement detection.</p>

            <p>Precise control of mechanical modes in the quantum regime is a key resource for quantum technologies, offering promising pathways for quantum sensing with macroscopic systems and scalable architectures for quantum simulation. In this work, we realise a multimode mechanical cavity coupled to a superconducting Kerr resonator, which induces nonlinearity in the mechanical modes. The Kerr mode is realised by a flux-tunable SQUID array resonator, while the mechanical modes are implemented by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavity. Both mechanical and electromagnetic modes are individually addressable via dedicated measurement lines, enabling full spectroscopic characterisation. We introduce a straightforward protocol to measure the SQUID array resonator's participation ratio in the hybrid acoustic modes, quantifying the degree of hybridisation. The participation ratio reveals that our device operates at the onset of the multimode coupling regime, where multiple acoustic modes simultaneously interact with the nonlinear superconducting element. Furthermore, this platform allows controllable Kerr-type nonlinearities in multiple acoustic modes, with the participation ratio serving as the key parameter determining both the dissipation rates and nonlinear strengths of these hybridised modes. Close to the resonant regime, we measure a cross-Kerr interaction between seven pairs of mechanical modes, which is controllable via the SQUID array resonator detuning. These results establish a platform for engineering nonlinear multimode mechanical interactions, offering potential for future integration with superconducting qubits and implementation of multiple mechanical qubits.</p>

            <h2>Heterodyne detection of low-frequency fields via Rydberg EIT with phase demodulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shenchao Jin, Xiayang Fan, Xin Wang, Yi Song, Yuan Sun</p>
            <p>Recently, the rapid progress of quantum sensing research reveals that the Rydberg atoms have great potentials in becoming high-precision centimeter-scale antenna of low-frequency fields. In order to facilitate efficient and reliable detection of low-frequency fields via Rydberg atoms, we design, implement and analyze a special but low-cost and scalable method based on heterodyning processes under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) embedded in typical two-photon ground-Rydberg transition. Instead of relying on observing changes in absorption of light by Rydberg atoms, our method focuses on the phase modulation effect on the probe laser induced by the low-frequency fields via the Rydberg EIT mechanism and utilizes a demodulation process to accurately retrieve the signal. The general principles of our method apply to both electric and magnetic fields and it is even possible to realize the combination of both functionalities in the same apparatus. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate the full cycle of operations with respect to both cases. In the measurement of low-frequency electric fields, we discover that the Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction among atoms induce linear superposition of Rydberg states with different angular momentum that generates a first-order response corresponding to the signature of linear Stark effect. As the Rydberg atoms have excellent coupling strengths with electric fields, our results indicate that our method can hopefully reach high-precision performance for practical tasks in the future.</p>

            <p>Quantum chemistry is among the most promising applications of quantum computing, offering the potential to solve complex electronic structure problems more efficiently than classical approaches. A critical component of any quantum algorithm is the measurement step, where the desired properties are extracted from a quantum computer. This review focuses on recent advancements in quantum measurement techniques tailored for quantum chemistry, particularly within the second quantized framework suitable for current and near-term quantum hardware. We provide a comprehensive overview of measurement strategies developed primarily for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its derivatives. These strategies address the inherent challenges posed by complexity of the electronic Hamiltonian operator. Additionally, we examine methods for estimating excited states and one- and two-electron properties, extending the applicability of quantum algorithms to broader chemical phenomena. Key aspects of the review include approaches for constructing measurement operators with reduced classical preprocessing and quantum implementation costs, techniques to minimize the number of measurements required for a given accuracy, and error mitigation strategies that leverage symmetries and other properties of the measurement operators. Furthermore, we explore measurement schemes rooted in Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which are expected to become viable with the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing. This review emphasizes foundational concepts and methodologies rather than numerical benchmarks, serving as a resource for researchers aiming to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum measurements in quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries, as highly efficient energy storage devices, have garnered significant research interest. A key challenge in their development is to maximize the extractable energy (ergotropy) when operating within a finite-temperature reservoir. To address this, we applied quantum feedback control to the charger and investigated the effects of fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored energy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system exhibits optimal charging parameters. In particular, in a fermionic thermal reservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery performance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a bosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and extraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency. Additionally, we explored the impact of battery size and found that, under a fermionic reservoir, increasing the battery size appropriately can further improve performance.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD), one of the latest cryptographic techniques, founded on the laws of quantum mechanics rather than mathematical complexity, promises for the first time unconditional secure remote communications. Integrating this technology into the next generation nuclear systems - designed for universal data collection and real-time sharing as well as cutting-edge instrumentation and increased dependency on digital technologies - could provide significant benefits enabling secure, unattended, and autonomous operation in remote areas, e.g., microreactors and fission batteries. However, any practical implementation on a critical reactor system must meet strict requirements on latency, control system compatibility, stability, and performance under operational transients. Here, we report the complete end-to-end demonstration of a phase-encoding decoy-state BB84 protocol QKD system under prototypic conditions on Purdue's fully digital nuclear reactor, PUR-1. The system was installed in PUR-1 successfully executing real-time encryption and decryption of 2,000 signals over optic fiber distances up to 82 km using OTP-based encryption and up to 140 km with AES-based encryption. For a core of 68 signals, OTP-secure communication was achieved for up to 135 km. The QKD system maintained a stable secret key rate of 320 kbps and a quantum bit error of 3.8% at 54 km. Our results demonstrate that OTP-based encryption introduces minimal latency while the more key-efficient AES and ASCON encryption schemes can significantly increase the number of signals encrypted without latency penalties. Additionally, implementation of a dynamic key pool ensures several hours of secure key availability during potential system downtimes. This work shows the potential of quantum-based secure remote communications for future digitally driven nuclear reactor technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick Stade, Wan-Hsuan Lin, Jason Cong, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises to solve previously intractable problems, with neutral atoms emerging as a promising technology. Zoned neutral atom architectures allow for immense parallelism and higher coherence times by shielding idling atoms from interference with laser beams. However, in addition to hardware, successful quantum computation requires sophisticated software support, particularly compilers that optimize quantum algorithms for hardware execution. In the compilation flow for zoned neutral atom architectures, the effective interplay of the placement and routing stages decides the overhead caused by rearranging the atoms during the quantum computation. Sub-optimal placements can lead to unnecessary serialization of the rearrangements in the subsequent routing stage. Despite this, all existing compilers treat placement and routing independently thus far - focusing solely on minimizing travel distances. This work introduces the first routing-aware placement method to address this shortcoming. It groups compatible movements into parallel rearrangement steps to minimize both rearrangement steps and travel distances. The implementation utilizing the A* algorithm reduces the rearrangement time by 17% on average and by 49% in the best case compared to the state-of-the-art. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model (LVCM). Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its excitation transfer in real time. We continuously drive the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by tuning the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of just one additional vibration reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work also establishes a scalable route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</p>

            <p>Similar to other perovskites in its family, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits a significant softening of the ferroelectric mode with decreasing temperature, a behavior that typically heralds the onset of a ferroelectric transition. However, this material remains paraelectric down to 0K due to the Heisenberg quantum uncertainty principle that prevents atoms from localizing in the ferroelectric minima, a fundamental limit that appears impossible to overcome. This work shows that in the strong out-of-equilibrium regime induced by resonant mid-IR pulses, quantum fluctuations can be suppressed, effectively cooling the material below the 0K ground state and inducing a ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ that is otherwise impossible. The appearance of a metastable state, that is distinct from the conventional ground state, is the first demonstration of how it is possible to leverage and control quantum fluctuations with pulsed light to qualitatively alter the free energy landscape of a quantum system. We predict the conditions and system parameter under which induced non-equilibrium state can be long-lived and even permanent. In providing a quantitative description, based on first principles machine learned potential energy surface, we explain recent experimental observations of light-induced ferroelectric transition in this material.</p>

This protocol leverages the NJL vacuum's rich entanglement structure, driven by the chiral condensate, to facilitate energy transfer without physical particle transport. We derive the energy flows and explore the roles of measurement and time evolution and validate the protocol through quantum circuit simulations on a lattice-regularized NJL model. Our findings highlight the NJL model's potential as a platform for exploring QET in interacting quantum field theories and pave the way for experimental realizations on quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta}\propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers.

Chen {\it et al}, arXiv:2311.09207] -- their implementation requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging {in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately preparing quantum thermal states that only requires the [repeated] implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous performance guarantees independent of detailed physical knowledge of $H$ beyond its locality.</p>

            <p>Tunneling ionization followed by strong-field excitation leads to important ultrafast phenomena such as charge migration and lasing. Recent theoretical developments suggest that the population of the ionic excited state can be greatly enhanced due to the complex interplay between tunneling and excitation. In this Letter, using an adiabatic approach for both tunneling and excitation, semi-analytical solutions are derived for the population and coherence of a two-level ionic system. This approach removes the strong-field dressing, revealing novel sub-half-cycle processes for excited state population and coherence buildup. It predicts that the excited state population is enhanced by an order of magnitude, independent of the laser wavelength, while coherence amplitude can be boosted by over four orders of magnitude for a multi-cycle pulse. For a single-cycle pulse, it suggests that coherence amplitude decreases rapidly as the wavelength increases. This work introduces a novel framework for generating and controlling the electronic excited state and coherence using intense laser pulses, with applications in strong-field control of chemistry and lasing.</p>

            <p>The photon statistics of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) exhibit dependencies on wavelength, pump power, and coincidence time. Notably, the average photon numbers were found to asymmetrically increase with increasing pump power around the degenerate wavelength of emission. By the coupling of the detection scheme to a spectrometer, studying different bandwidths within the emission revealed that shorter wavelengths increased nonlinearly with pump power, while longer wavelengths showed more linear behavior, indicating a wavelength dependent efficiency in the generation of the SPDC. We employ the use of a four detector Hanbury Brown and Twiss Interferometer to study the photon statistics of the signal beam, where the idler serves as the herald. The measured statistics were found to be best described by a Negative Binomial Distribution, which is a characteristic of thermal light sources. The detection and characterization of complex light sources has wide ranging applications in the fields of quantum metrology, quantum communications, and quantum computing, more specifically, a system that is sensitive to wavelength and photon number distribution.</p>

We utilize quantum Fisher information (QFI) to evaluate the metrological potential of the QOMG scheme. It is found that the Kerr interaction can significantly enhances the sensitivity of the QOMG. We observe the super-Hesenberg scaling of parameter estimation precision. Furthermore, we also evaluate the performance of QOMG for the quadrature measurement. It is indicated that the sensitivity in the quadrature measurement scheme can saturate the quantum Crmamér-Rao bound. We study the effect of the driving and dissipation of the optical cavity on the QFI, and find that the sensitivity can be manipulated by changing the driving while dissipation decreases the sensitivity. The work shows that the photon nonlinear interaction can improve sensitivity of QOMG, and demonstrates a valuable quantum resource for the QOMG. These results could have a wide-ranging impact on developing high-performance QOMG in the future.</p>

            <h2>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Caesar M. Flores, Stefanos Carlstr Carlstrom, Serguei Patchkovskii, Andres F. Ordonez, Olga Smirnova</p>
            <p>Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality.</p>

            <h2>Markovian dissipation can stabilize a (localization) quantum phase transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naushad A. Kamar, Mostafa Ali, Mohammad Maghrebi</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are a cornerstone of many-body physics at low temperatures but have remained elusive far from equilibrium. Driven open quantum systems -- a prominent non-equilibrium platform where coherent dynamics competes with Markovian dissipation from the environment -- often exhibit an effective classical behavior. In this work, we present a nontrivial quantum phase transition that is stabilized, rather than destroyed, by Markovian dissipation. We consider a variant of the paradigmatic spin-boson model where the spin is driven and bosons are subject to Markovian loss proportional to frequency (hence, vanishing at low frequencies). We show that the steady state exhibits a localization phase transition where the spin's dynamics is frozen, to be contrasted with the ground-state transition in the absence of dissipation. Furthermore, this transition occurs when the steady state becomes pure. The latter is not simply a dark state of dissipation but rather emerges from a nontrivial renormalization of the spin dynamics by low-frequency bosonic modes. Our work provides a nontrivial example where quantumness, typically reserved for ground states, also emerges in dynamical settings, with potential applications in quantum computation.</p>

            <p>The development of deterministic single photon sources emitting in the telecommunication bands is a key challenge for quantum communication and photonic quantum computing. Here, we investigate the optical properties and single-photon emission of molecular beam epitaxy grown semiconductor quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C- bands. The quantum dots are embedded in a InGaAs matrix with fixed indium content grown on top of a compositionally graded InGaAs buffer. This structure allows for the future implementation of electrically contacted nanocavities to enable high-quality and bright QD emission. In detailed optical characterizations we observe linewidths as low as $ 50 \mu$eV, close to the spectrometer resolution limit, low fine structure splittings close to $ 10 \mu$eV, and $g^{(2)} (0)$ values as low as $0.08$. These results advance the current performance metrics for MBE-grown quantum dots on GaAs substrates emitting in the telecom bands and showcase the potential of the presented heterostructures for further integration into photonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Sharmila, Sander M. Vermeulen, Animesh Datta</p>
            <p>Spacetime fluctuations (SFs), a common feature of different proposed gravity models, could be detected using laser interferometers. In the search for SFs, a correspondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models is needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for identifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a correspondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers. We consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay behaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our approach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-Pérot arm cavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such as the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected interferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for each class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale instruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes of SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on the nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that LIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shangyun Wang, Songbai Chen, Jiliang Jing, Jieci Wang, Heng Fan</p>
            <p>Quantum chaos is an intriguing topic and has attracted a great deal of interests in quantum mechanics and black hole physics. Recently, the exponential growth of out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has been proposed to diagnose quantum chaos and verify the correspondence principle. Here, good correspondence is found between the linear entanglement entropy and the semiclassical phase space structures in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model. The Loschmidt echo in the chaotic sea decays more faster than that in the stable island. However, the OTOCs grow exponentially at early times for the initial states centered both in the chaotic and stable regions. The exponential growth of the OTOC is attributed to quantum collapse that provides a novel mechanism of yielding exponential growth of the OTOC in quantum systems. Moreover, the quantum collapse effect is more obvious for the initial states centered in the chaotic one. The results show that in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model, the linear entanglement entropy, and Loschmidt echo are more effective than OTOC for diagnosing quantum chaotic signals.</p>

            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has been highly influential in explaining thermodynamic behavior of closed quantum systems. As of yet, it is unclear whether and how the ETH applies to non-Hermitian systems. Here, we introduce a framework that extends the ETH to non-Hermitian systems, within which expectation values of local operators reproduce statistical and scaling predictions known from Hermitian ETH. We illustrate the validity of the framework on non-Hermitian random-matrix and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Further, we show numerically how the static ETH predictions become imprinted onto the dynamics of local observables. Finally, we present a prescription for observing both ETH-obeying and ETH-violating regimes in an optical-lattice experiment that implements a disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson model. Our results generalize the celebrated ETH to the non-Hermitian setting, and they show how it affects the system dynamics, and how the salient signatures can be observed in present-day cold-atom experiments.</p>

            <h2>Advantage of multi-partite entanglement for quantum cryptography over long and short ranged networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janka Memmen, Jens Eisert, Nathan Walk</p>
            <p>The increasing sophistication of available quantum networks has seen a corresponding growth in the pursuit of multi-partite cryptographic protocols. Whilst the use of multi-partite entanglement is known to offer an advantage in certain abstractly motivated contexts, the quest to find practical advantage scenarios is ongoing and substantial difficulties in generalising some bi-partite security proofs still remain. We present rigorous results that address both these challenges at the same time. First, we prove the security of a variant of the GHZ state based secret sharing protocol against general attacks, including participant attacks which break the security of the original GHZ state scheme. We then identify parameters for a performance advantage over realistic bottleneck networks. We show that whilst channel losses limit the advantage region to short distances over direct transmission networks, the addition of quantum repeaters unlocks the performance advantage of multi-partite entanglement over point-to-point approaches for long distance quantum cryptography.</p>

            <p>Here we present the results of benchmarking a quantum processor based on trapped $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions by performing basic quantum machine learning algorithms. Using a quantum-enhanced support vector machine algorithm with up to five qubits we perform a supervised binary classification on two types of datasets: small binary digit images and weighted graphs with a ring topology. For the first dataset, images are intentionally selected so that they could be classified with 100% accuracy. This allows us to specifically examine different types of quantum encodings of the digit dataset and study the impact of experimental noise. In the second dataset, graphs are divided into two categories based on the spectral structure of their Ising Hamiltonian models, which is related to the NP-hard problem. For this problem we consider an embedding of an exponentially large Hamiltonian spectrum into an entangled state of a linear number of qubits. For both problems, we study various levels of circuit optimization and found that, for all experiments conducted, we achieve classifiers with 100% accuracy on both training and testing datasets. This demonstrates that the quantum processor has the ability to correctly solve the basic classification task under consideration. As we expect, with the increase in the capabilities of quantum processors, they can be utilized for solving machine learning tasks.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Stabilizer-based Entanglement Distillation Protocol for Qudits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Popp, Tobias C. Sutter, Beatrix C. Hiesmayr</p>
            <p>Entanglement distillation, the process of converting weakly entangled states into maximally entangled ones using Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC), is pivotal for robust entanglement-assisted quantum information processing in error-prone environments. A construction based on stabilizer codes offers an effective method for designing such protocols. By analytically investigating the effective action of stabilizer protocols for systems of prime dimension $d$, we establish a standard form for the output states of recurrent stabilizer-based distillation. This links the properties of input states, stabilizers, and encodings to the properties of the protocol. Based on those insights, we present a novel two-copy distillation protocol, applicable to all bipartite states in prime dimension, that maximizes the fidelity increase per iteration for Bell-diagonal states. The power of this framework and the protocol is demonstrated through numerical investigations, which provide evidence for superior performance in terms of efficiency and distillability of low-fidelity states compared to other well-established recurrence protocols. By elucidating the interplay between states, errors, and protocols, our contribution advances the systematic development of highly effective distillation protocols, enhancing our understanding of distillability.</p>

For two-level systems, we put forward the phenomenon of chiral state conversion as a mechanism for effectively eliminating superpositions. This perspective opens a way to simulate quantum measurements in classical systems that up to now were restricted to the Schrödinger part of the quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.</p>

            <p>When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.</p>

            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) has been central to detecting exotic phases of matter, often linked to complex superconducting order parameters or unique magnetic phenomena. Here, we leverage circuit electrodynamics capabilities of superconducting devices to propose a novel scheme based on a multimode superconducting ring resonator for sensitive probing of TRSB in quantum materials. Our device enables strong nonlinear interactions between the modes and we show that these interactions can lead to highly symmetric configurations which are sensitive to TRSB. Using a driven-dissipative model, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of a two-mode superconducting circuit with self- and cross-Kerr nonlinearities under conditions near the bifurcation threshold. When TRSB coupling is introduced, the critical behavior of the system serves as a highly sensitive detection method. Specifically, by mapping out the optimal parameter regimes, we show that even when the photon occupation numbers are subjected to different initial conditions, they can be driven into a symmetric configuration which can be broken even with weak TRSB. Our findings highlight the utility of superconducting microwave resonators other than quantum information processing as a tool for probing exotic states of matter.</p>

            <p>Blind quantum computing (BQC) is a computational paradigm that allows a client with limited quantum capabilities to delegate quantum computations to a more powerful server while keeping both the algorithm and data hidden. However, in practice, existing BQC protocols face significant challenges when scaling to large-scale computations due to photon losses, low efficiencies, and high overheads associated with fault-tolerant operations, requiring the client to compile both logical operations and error correction primitives. We use a recently demonstrated hybrid light-matter approach [PRL 132, 150604 (2024); Science 388, 509-513 (2025)] to develop an architecture for scalable fault-tolerant blind quantum computation. By combining high-fidelity local gates on the server's matter qubits with delegated blind rotations using photons, we construct loss-tolerant delegated gates that enable efficient algorithm compilation strategies and a scalable approach for fault-tolerant blind logical algorithms. Our approach improves the error-correction threshold and increases the speed and depth of blind logical circuits. Finally, we outline how this architecture can be implemented on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, including neutral atom arrays and solid-state spin defects. These new capabilities open up new opportunities for deep circuit blind quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) will most likely be an integral part of any practical quantum network in the future. However, not all QKD protocols can be used in today's networks because of the lack of single-photon emitters and noisy intermediate quantum hardware. Attenuated-photon transmission, typically used to simulate single-photon emitters, severely limits the achievable transmission distances and makes the integration of the QKD into existing classical networks, that use tens of thousands of photons per bit of transmission, difficult. Furthermore, it has been found that protocol performance varies with topology. In order to remove the reliance of QKD on single-photon emitters and increase transmission distances, it is worthwhile to explore QKD protocols that do not rely on single-photon transmissions for security, such as the 3-stage QKD protocol, which can tolerate multiple photons in each burst without information leakage. This paper compares and contrasts the 3-stage QKD protocol with conventional QKD protocols and its efficiency in different network topologies and conditions. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical relationship between achievable key rates to increase transmission distances in various topologies.</p>

            <p>This study examines a system of three coupled qubits, focusing on entanglement measures in the presence of decoherence. It utilizes an XXZ Heisenberg chain with an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, considering intrinsic decoherence. The results reveal that only the magnetic field strength affects entanglement, while intrinsic decoherence suppresses it, with stronger decoherence leading to greater suppression. Various decoherence channels are analyzed, showing that the $I$-tangle typically decreases with increased decoherence, except for the generalized W state under phase damping channel, where only one qubit is affected. Interestingly, dark periods of $I$-tangle occur for the GHZ state under non-Markovian dephasing, and while steady-state entanglement disappears in this channel, it remains nonzero when starting from a mixture of GHZ and fully separable states. Additionally, under generalized amplitude damping channel, reduced bipartite states of a W state exhibit entanglement sudden death, while the steady-state $I$-tangle for the spectral decomposed state stays nonzero.</p>

Quantum polar codes satisfy some of these requirements but lack certain critical features, thereby hindering their widespread use. Existing constructions either require entanglement assistance to produce valid quantum codes, suffer from poor finite-size performance, or fail to tailor polar codes to the underlying channel properties. Meanwhile, quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes demonstrate strong performance, though no known efficient decoding algorithm exists for them. In this work, we propose strategies to interpolate between quantum polar codes and quantum RM codes, thus addressing the challenges of designing valid quantum polar codes without entanglement assistance and improving finite-size code performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcello Baldo</p>
            <p>The spontaneous decay of an excited atom by photon emission is one of the most common and elementary physical process present in nature and in laboratories. The decay is random in time with constant probability density, as it can be inferred by the exponential law observed experimentally. Despite the simplicity of the process, in Quantum Mechanics the decay itself is considered a law of nature which is not further analyzed or explained. However it is legitimate to ask for the reason of its randomness and for the dynamics of the atom around the decay. The decay process of an isolated atom is usually assumed to be instantaneous, the so called Quantum jumps. Particular experimental arrangements can widen the duration of the transition from an excited state to the ground state to a finite time. In general this is due to the quantum back action of the detector. The development of Quantum Optics has enormously enriched the possibilities to study in detail the process, and new illuminating insights have been obtained, but the question is still valid and its answer is still elusive. In this paper we analyze the spontaneous decay within the new prospect introduced by a recent model that complete standard Quantum Mechanics in a formalism which is able to describe the dynamics of measurement and of spontaneous decay. Comparison is made with more phenomenological theories, the Quantum Mechanics of open system and the Stochastic wave function model. In the new model the stochastic photon emission by an excited atom is triggered by the vacuum fluctuations. It is suggested how to re-analyze three types of experiments, already realized in many laboratories, in order to reveal the presence and the effect of these fluctuations.</p>

So far, non-classical features have not been found in QSHHG yet. The closed form theory of QSHHG in atoms and solids developed here answers the question under which conditions non-classical features can be realized. QSHHG results in a multi-mode entanglement between harmonic sideband modes and perturbative quantum mode. A projective measurement on either creates a variety of non-classical states commonly used in quantum information science. This opens a pathway towards quantum engineering high harmonic generation as a short wavelength source for quantum information science.</p>

Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</p>

            <p>We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.</p>

            <h2>Polarization-dependent topology in quantum emitter chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Sturm, Adriana Pálffy</p>
            <p>The role of polarization in the topology of quantum emitter chains is investigated theoretically, whereby "polarization" refers to the transition dipole moments of the emitters. We show that, if the chain is zigzag-shaped, different topological phases can be realized by adjusting the polarization direction. It turns out that long-range dipole-dipole couplings weaken the bulk-boundary correspondence, but on the other hand give rise to higher-order topological phases with four observable edge modes. We also demonstrate how the polarization orientation can be used to define an additional dimension and simulate a synthetic Chern insulator. Our findings open up a way to actively switch between various topological phases within a single arrangement of quantum emitters.</p>

            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has become a widely used platform for quantum sensing. The four NV axes in mono-crystalline diamond specifically allow for vector magnetometry, with magnetic-field sensitivities reaching down to $\mathrm{fT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The current literature primarily focuses on improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the experimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured spin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact, analytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies from a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating the magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally, the accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote using the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured resonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.</p>

            <h2>Effect of noise and topologies on multi-photon quantum protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nitin Jha, Abhishek Parakh, Mahadevan Subramaniam</p>
            <p>Quantum-augmented networks aim to use quantum phenomena to improve detection and protection against malicious actors in a classical communication network. This may include multiplexing quantum signals into classical fiber optical channels and incorporating purely quantum links alongside classical links in the network. In such hybrid networks, quantum protocols based on single photons become a bottleneck for transmission distances and data speeds, thereby reducing entire network performance. Furthermore, many of the security assumptions of the single-photon protocols do not hold up in practice because of the impossibility of manufacturing single-photon emitters. Multi-photon quantum protocols, on the other hand, are designed to operate under practical assumptions and do not require single photon emitters. As a result, they provide higher levels of security guarantees and longer transmission distances. However, the effect of channel and device noise on multiphoton protocols in terms of security, transmission distances, and bit rates has not been investigated. In this paper, we focus on channel noise and present our observations on the effect of various types of noise on multi-photon protocols. We also investigate the effect of topologies such as ring, star, and torus on the noise characteristics of the multi-photon protocols. Our results show the possible advantages of switching to multi-photon protocols and give insights into the repeater placement and topology choice for quantum-augmented networks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Predictive Performance of Deep Quantum Data Re-uploading Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wang, Han-Xiao Tao, Re-Bing Wu</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning models incorporating data re-uploading circuits have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional expressivity and trainability. However, their ability to generate accurate predictions on unseen data, referred to as the predictive performance, remains insufficiently investigated. This study reveals a fundamental limitation in predictive performance when deep encoding layers are employed within the data re-uploading model. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that when processing high-dimensional data with limited-qubit data re-uploading models, their predictive performance progressively degenerates to near random-guessing levels as the number of encoding layers increases. In this context, the repeated data uploading cannot mitigate the performance degradation. These findings are validated through experiments on both synthetic linearly separable datasets and real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that when processing high-dimensional data, the quantum data re-uploading models should be designed with wider circuit architectures rather than deeper and narrower ones.</p>

            <p>Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.</p>

            <p>We present a digital quantum computation of two-hadron scattering in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions. We prepare well-separated single-particle wave packets with desired momentum-space wavefunctions, and simulate their collision through digitized time evolution. Multiple hadronic wave packets can be produced using the efficient, systematically improvable algorithm of this work, achieving high fidelity with the target initial state. Specifically, employing a trapped-ion quantum computer (IonQ Forte), we prepare up to three meson wave packets using 11 and 27 system qubits, and simulate collision dynamics of two meson wave packets for the smaller system. Results for local observables are consistent with numerical simulations at early times, but decoherence effects limit evolution into long times. We demonstrate the critical role of high-fidelity initial states for precision measurements of state-sensitive observables, such as $S$-matrix elements. Our work establishes the potential of quantum computers in simulating hadron-scattering processes in strongly interacting gauge theories.</p>

We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes.

            <h2>Generating Asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering between Two movable Mirrors Exploiting Correlated-Emission Laser</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamal El Qars, Ismail Essaoudi, Abdelmajid Ainane</p>
            <p>Quantum steering is a form of quantum correlation that exhibits an inherent asymmetry, distinguishing it from entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It is now understood that quantum steering plays a pivotal role in asymmetric quantum information tasks. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate asymmetric steering between two mechanical modes by transferring quantum coherence from a correlated-emission laser. To accomplish this, we derive quantum Langevin equations to describe the optomechanical coupling between two cavity modes and two mechanical modes along with the master equation of two-mode laser. By examining the case where the cavity modes scatter at the anti-Stokes sidebands, we demonstrate that both two-way and one-way steering can be achieved by adjusting the strength of the field driving the gain medium of the laser. Furthermore, we show that the direction of one-way steering can be controlled by varying the temperatures of the mechanical baths or the strengths of the optomechanical couplings. Additionally, we reveal that the directionality of one-way steering depends on the modes fluctuation levels of the modes, with the mode exhibiting larger fluctuations determining the direction. This highly controllable scheme could potentially be realized with current technology, offering a promising platform for implementing one-way quantum information tasks.</p>

            <h2>Critical Spectrum and Quantum Criticality in the Two-Photon Rabi-Stark Model</h2>

            <p>We investigate the spectral properties and quantum criticality of the two-photon Rabi-Stark model. Using the exact solution of this model, we rigorously derive a condition for complete spectral collapse, where all bound states vanish. In this case, the energy gap closes at a critical coupling, signaling a continuous quantum phase transition. The corresponding gap exponent differs from those in both the one-photon Rabi-Stark model and the quantum Rabi model, suggesting a distinct universality class. Furthermore, mapping to an inverse square potential well reveals an infinite number of discrete bound states at high two-level atomic frequencies, with their energies approaching the threshold exponentially. Our results offer new insights into novel spectral phenomena in nonlinear quantum Rabi models, with potential implications for experimental realizations in circuit QED and trapped ion systems.</p>

First, we verify continuous-variable entanglement by measuring an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement parameter of 0.0132(7), which is below the threshold of 0.25 for Reid's EPR criterion. Second, we perform a continuous-variable Bell test and find a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, measuring 2.26(3), which is above the entanglement threshold of 2.

            <p>We theoretically investigate excitation dynamics in one-dimensional arrays of quantum emitters coupled to a waveguide, focusing on localization and long-time population trapping. By combining time-domain simulations with spectral analysis of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we identify two distinct mechanisms that give rise to localization: geometry-induced subradiance and disorder-induced Anderson-like confinement. Spatially modulated emitter arrangements--such as single- and double-Gaussian transverse profiles--enable long-lived subradiant modes even in the absence of disorder, with decay rates that can be finely controlled via geometric parameters. In contrast, localization in uniform arrays emerges only when disorder breaks spatial symmetry and suppresses collective emission through interference. We track the crossover between geometric and disorder-induced regimes, finding that double-Gaussian profiles exhibit clear spatial signatures of this transition, while single-Gaussian configurations display more gradual changes. These results establish geometry and disorder as complementary tools for engineering long-lived quantum states in waveguide QED systems, with direct relevance for scalable implementations in photonic platforms.</p>

            <p>Topological phases are states of matter defined by global topological invariants that remain invariant under adiabatic parameter variations, provided no topological phase transition occurs. This endows them with intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Experimentally, these phases are often identified indirectly by observing robust boundary states, protected by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we propose an experimental method for the direct measurement of topological invariants via adiabatic state evolution in electroacoustic coupled resonators, where time-dependent cavity modes effectively emulate the bulk wavefunction of a periodic system. Under varying external driving fields, specially prepared initial states evolve along distinct parameter-space paths. By tracking the relative phase differences among states along these trajectories, we successfully observe the quantized Zak phase in both the conventional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and its extension incorporating with next-nearest-neighbor coupling. This approach provides compelling experimental evidence for the precise identification of topological invariants and can be extended to more complex topological systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a molecular optomechanical platform to generate robust entanglement among bosonic modes-photons, phonons, and plasmons-under ambient conditions. The system integrates an ultrahigh-Q whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical resonator with a plasmonic nanocavity formed by a metallic nanoparticle and a single molecule. This hybrid architecture offers two critical advantages over standalone plasmonic systems: (i) Efficient redirection of Stokes photons from the lossy plasmonic mode into the long-lived WGM resonator, and (ii) Suppression of molecular absorption and approaching vibrational ground states via plasmon-WGM interactions. These features enable entanglement to transfer from the fragile plasmon-phonon subsystem to a photon-phonon bipartition in the blue-detuned regime, yielding robust stationary entanglement resilient to environmental noise. Remarkably, the achieved entanglement surpasses the theoretical bound for conventional two-mode squeezing in certain parameter regimes. Our scheme establishes a universal approach to safeguard entanglement in open quantum systems and opens avenues for noise-resilient quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a key application in quantum communication, enabling secure key exchange between parties using quantum states. Twin-field (TF) QKD offers a promising solution that surpasses the repeaterless limits, and its measurement-device-independent nature makes it suitable for star-type network architectures. In this work, we propose a scalable TF-QKD network with adaptable architecture, where users prepare quantum signals and send them to network nodes. These nodes use an optical switch to route the signals to multi-user measurement units, enabling secure key distribution among arbitrary users and adapting to complex connection demands of the network. A proof-of-principle demonstration with three users successfully achieved secure key sharing over simulated link losses of up to $30$ dB, with an average rate of $19.57$ bit/s. Additionally, simulations show that the proposed architecture can achieve a total secure key rate of $4.84 \times 10^{4}$ bit/s at $100$ km in a symmetric $32$-user network. This approach represents a significant advancement in the topology of untrusted-node QKD networks and holds promise for practical, large-scale applications in secure communication.</p>

            <p>Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>The speed of information propagation in long-range interacting quantum systems is limited by Lieb-Robinson-type bounds, whose tightness can be established by finding specific quantum state-transfer protocols. Previous works have given quantum state-transfer protocols that saturate the corresponding Lieb-Robinson bounds using time-dependent Hamiltonians. Are speed limits for quantum information propagation different for time-independent Hamiltonians? In a step towards addressing this question, we present and analyze two optimal time-independent state-transfer protocols for free-particle systems, which utilize continuous-time single-particle quantum walks with hopping strength decaying as a power law. We rigorously prove and numerically confirm that our protocols achieve quantum state transfer, with controllable error over an arbitrarily long distance in any spatial dimension, at the speed limits set by the free-particle Lieb-Robinson bounds. This shows that time independence does not limit information flow for long-range free-particle Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>While the impact of locality restrictions on quantum dynamics and algorithmic complexity has been well studied in the general case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, the capabilities of time-independent protocols are less well understood. Using clock constructions, we show that the light cone for time-independent Hamiltonians, as captured by Lieb-Robinson bounds, is the same as that for time-dependent systems when local ancillas are allowed. More specifically, we develop time-independent protocols for approximate quantum state transfer with the same run-times as their corresponding time-dependent protocols. Given any piecewise-continuous Hamiltonian, our construction gives a time-independent Hamiltonian that implements its dynamics in the same time, up to error $\varepsilon$, at the cost of introducing a number of local ancilla qubits for each data qubit that is polylogarithmic in the number of qubits, the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivative (if it exists), the run time, and $1/\varepsilon$. We apply this construction to state transfer for systems with power-law-decaying interactions and one-dimensional nearest-neighbor systems with disordered interaction strengths. In both cases, this gives time-independent protocols with the same optimal light-cone-saturating run-times as their time-dependent counterparts.</p>

            <p>Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Xuan Wang, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Entanglement of Multi-Level Atoms in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nancy Ghangas, Shubhrangshu Dasgupta</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within PC cavities. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. In our analysis, we show that resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference serve as potent tools for tuning and stabilizing entanglement in structured photonic environments. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when interatomic distances align with the localization length of photonic bound states induced by bandgap which enables coherent coupling via evanescent fields. The entanglement is preserved for extended times when dipoles of each atom are aligned parallel or anti-parallel while a novel oscillatory entanglement mechanism emerges from orthogonally aligned atomic dipoles. It is mainly driven by destructive interference between vacuum-mediated pathways and bandgap-engineered photonic density of states. This mechanism exhibits non-Markovian dynamics, including delayed feedback and entanglement revival. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian effects on the quantum parameter estimation in pseudo-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. H. Wei, H. J. Xing, L. B. Fu, H. D. Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a fundamental quantity in quantum parameter estimation theory, characterizing the ultimate precision bound of parameter estimation. In this work, we investigate QFI for quantum states in non-Hermitian systems. By employing the projected Hilbert space method and spectral decomposition, we derive an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of the density matrix and parameter generators. This formulation not only recovers the well-known results in the Hermitian case but also captures the non-Hermitian effects induced by the time-dependent norm of the state. To validate our theoretical framework, we analyze a single-qubit pseudo-Hermitian system and apply Naimark dilation theory to embed it into an equivalent Hermitian system. The comparison between the original and dilated systems demonstrates the consistency and applicability of the proposed QFI formula in non-Hermitian settings. In addition, we investigate a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system to further explore the influence of non-Hermiticity on QFI. Our findings offer a new perspective for analyzing and enhancing QFI in non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for promising applications in non-Hermitian quantum metrology and sensing.</p>

            <h2>Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Bernazzani, Balázs Gulácsi, Guido Burkard</p>
            <p>We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is universal. That is, it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term, as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. By considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we also derive the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudomodes for quantum environments.</p>

            <h2>Truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz: efficient quantum circuit design for quantum chemistry and material science</h2>

            <p>Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry and material science by offering solutions to complex problems unattainable with classical computers. However, the development of efficient quantum algorithms that are efficient under noisy conditions remains a major challenge. This paper introduces the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (tVHA), a novel circuit design for conducting quantum calculations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. tVHA provides a promising approach for a broad range of applications by utilizing principles from the adiabatic theorem in solid state physics. Our proposed ansatz significantly reduces the parameter count and can decrease circuit size substantially, with a trade-off in accuracy. Thus, tVHA facilitates easier convergence within the variational quantum eigensolver framework compared to state-of-the-art ansätze such as Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) and Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA). While this paper concentrates on the practical applications of tVHA in quantum chemistry, demonstrating its suitability for both weakly and strongly correlated systems and its compatibility with active space calculations, its underlying principles suggest a wider applicability extending to the broader field of material science computations on quantum computing platforms.</p>

The calculated external-magnetic-field dependence of the total energy, of the magnetization, as well as of the topological charge exhibits a distinctive discontinuity which hints for the existence of zero-temperature magnetic skyrmions-like structures at the quantum level, controlled by the combination of the exchange-coupling and the DMI parameters. The potentially measurable jump in the magnetization upon changing the field indicates the investigated objects as stable enough for eventual applications in spintronics or even as information carriers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayaka Usui, Artur Niezgoda, Manuel Gessner</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) can be operated as an analog simulator of the two-dimensional vibron model. This algebraic model for the description of bending and stretching vibrations of molecules, in the case of a triatomic molecules, exhibits two phases where linear and bent configurations are stabilised. Spinor BECs can be engineered to simulate states that correspond to linear or bent triatomic molecules, with the BEC's Wigner function encoding information about the molecular configuration. We show how quantum simulations of the bending dynamics of linear molecules can be realized, and how the straightening of a bent molecule leads to a dynamical instability. In the dynamics triggered by the corresponding instability, a significant amount of entanglement is generated, and we characterise the dynamics with the squeezing parameter and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The scaling of the non-Gaussian sensitivity, described by the difference between squeezing and QFI, grows with the system size once the spinor system crosses from the linear to the bent phase, thus serving as a dynamical witness for the quantum phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Advantage of multi-partite entanglement for quantum cryptography over long and short ranged networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janka Memmen, Jens Eisert, Nathan Walk</p>
            <p>The increasing sophistication of available quantum networks has seen a corresponding growth in the pursuit of multi-partite cryptographic protocols. Whilst the use of multi-partite entanglement is known to offer an advantage in certain abstractly motivated contexts, the quest to find practical advantage scenarios is ongoing and substantial difficulties in generalising some bi-partite security proofs still remain. We present rigorous results that address both these challenges at the same time. First, we prove the security of a variant of the GHZ state based secret sharing protocol against general attacks, including participant attacks which break the security of the original GHZ state scheme. We then identify parameters for a performance advantage over realistic bottleneck networks. We show that whilst channel losses limit the advantage region to short distances over direct transmission networks, the addition of quantum repeaters unlocks the performance advantage of multi-partite entanglement over point-to-point approaches for long distance quantum cryptography.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up, due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine the necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Accurate classification of brain tumors from MRI scans is critical for effective treatment planning. This study presents a Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (HQCNN) that integrates quantum feature-encoding circuits with depth-wise separable convolutional layers to analyze images from a publicly available brain tumor dataset. Evaluated on this dataset, the HQCNN achieved 99.16% training accuracy and 91.47% validation accuracy, demonstrating robust performance across varied imaging conditions. The quantum layers capture complex, non-linear relationships, while separable convolutions ensure computational efficiency. By reducing both parameter count and circuit depth, the architecture is compatible with near-term quantum hardware and resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish a foundation for integrating quantum-enhanced models into medical-imaging workflows with minimal changes to existing software platforms. Future work will extend evaluation to multi-center cohorts, assess real-time inference on quantum simulators and hardware, and explore integration with surgical-planning systems.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Time Dependent and Nonlinear Classical Oscillators through Nonlinear Schrödingerization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Muraleedharan, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>We present quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of a broad class of classical oscillator systems containing $2^n$ coupled oscillators (Eg: $2^n$ masses coupled by springs), including those with time-dependent forces, time-varying stiffness matrices, and weak nonlinear interactions. This generalization of the Harmonic oscillator simulation algorithm is achieved through an approach that we call ``Nonlinear Schrödingerization'', which involves reduction of the dynamical system to a nonlinear Schrödinger equation and then reduced to a time-independent Schrodinger Equation through perturbative techniques. The linearization of the equation is performed using an approach that allows the dynamics of a nonlinear Schrödinger equation to be approximated as a linear Schrödinger equation in a higher dimensional space. This allows Hamiltonian Simulation algorithms to be applied to simulate the dynamics of resulting system. When the properties of the classical dynamical systems can be efficiently queried, and when the initial state can be efficiently prepared, the complexity of our quantum algorithm is polynomial in $n$, and almost linear in evolution time for most dynamical systems. Our work extends the applicability of quantum algorithms to simulate the dynamics of non-conservative and nonlinear classical systems, addressing key limitations in previous approaches.</p>

            <p>The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation and phenomena such as prethermalization and weak ergodicity breaking.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD), one of the latest cryptographic techniques, founded on the laws of quantum mechanics rather than mathematical complexity, promises for the first time unconditional secure remote communications. Integrating this technology into the next generation nuclear systems - designed for universal data collection and real-time sharing as well as cutting-edge instrumentation and increased dependency on digital technologies - could provide significant benefits enabling secure, unattended, and autonomous operation in remote areas, e.g., microreactors and fission batteries. However, any practical implementation on a critical reactor system must meet strict requirements on latency, control system compatibility, stability, and performance under operational transients. Here, we report the complete end-to-end demonstration of a phase-encoding decoy-state BB84 protocol QKD system under prototypic conditions on Purdue's fully digital nuclear reactor, PUR-1. The system was installed in PUR-1 successfully executing real-time encryption and decryption of 2,000 signals over optic fiber distances up to 82 km using OTP-based encryption and up to 140 km with AES-based encryption. For a core of 68 signals, OTP-secure communication was achieved for up to 130 km. The QKD system maintained a stable secret key rate of 320 kbps and a quantum bit error of 3.8% at 54 km. Our results demonstrate that OTP-based encryption introduces minimal latency while the more key-efficient AES and ASCON encryption schemes can significantly increase the number of signals encrypted without latency penalties. Additionally, implementation of a dynamic key pool ensures several hours of secure key availability during potential system downtimes. This work shows the potential of quantum-based secure remote communications for future digitally driven nuclear reactor technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution is a point-to-point communication protocol that leverages quantum mechanics to enable secure information exchange. Commonly, the transmitter and receiver stations are at fixed locations, and the single-photon quantum states are transmitted over fiber or free space. Here, we describe a modular, platform-agnostic, quantum key distribution transmitter and receiver with reduced size, weight, and power consumption to realize a mobile quantum communication system. We deploy the system on different moving platforms, demonstrating drone-to-drone, drone-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-vehicle quantum communication, achieving secure key rates in the finite-key regime in the range of 1.6 - 20 kbps. To prove the security of the system, we develop advanced physics models of the devices that account for non-ideal behaviors that are of greater importance in mobile platforms. The modular system can be easily upgraded to include sources of entangled photonic quantum states, which will find application in future quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing promises to revolutionize many-body simulations for quantum chemistry, but its potential is constrained by limited qubits and noise in current devices. In this work, we introduce the Lossy Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (Lossy-QSCI) framework, which combines a lossy subspace Hamiltonian preparation pipeline with a generic QSCI selection process. This framework integrates a chemistry-inspired lossy Random Linear Encoder (Chemical-RLE) with a neural network-assisted Fermionic Expectation Decoder (NN-FED). The RLE leverages fermionic number conservation to compress quantum states, reducing qubit requirements to O(N log M) for M spin orbitals and N electrons, while preserving crucial ground state information and enabling self-consistent configuration recovery. NN-FED, powered by a neural network trained with minimal data, efficiently decodes these compressed states, overcoming the measurement challenges common in the approaches of the traditional QSCI and its variants. Through iterative quantum sampling and classical post-processing, our hybrid method refines ground state estimates with high efficiency. Demonstrated on the C2 and LiH molecules, our framework achieves chemical accuracy with fewer qubits and basis states, paving a scalable pathway for quantum chemistry simulations on both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional entanglement in the form of transverse spatial correlation between a pair of photons generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion is not only a valuable resource in many academic and real-life applications but also provides access to several intriguing quantum phenomena. One such non-intuitive phenomenon is phase entanglement, in which the biphoton state is correlated in the complex phase of its wavefunction. This state, which emerges during the propagation of the biphoton wavefunction, exhibits neither position nor momentum correlation, yet retains full entanglement. In this work, we experimentally explore this state in two distinct ways. The first is by tracking the vanishing spatial photon number correlation over propagation distances lying in $\left[0,\infty\right)$, folded into a finite range using single-lens imaging. These observations show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions based on the Double Gaussian (DG) approximation of the biphoton state. The second approach involves performing a two-photon interference experiment using a double slit and this state, which reveals the correlated phase front. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the observed two-photon interference structure is markedly different from that produced by position-correlated photons, as confirmed by computing the joint probability distribution of photons (JPD) and related metrics. Such interference using phase-entangled light has not been attempted before and opens avenues for advanced experiments and applications in the field of spatial entanglement.</p>

            <p>Multipartite quantum repeaters play an important role in quantum communication networks enabling the transmission of quantum information over larger distances. To increase the rates for multipartite entanglement distribution, multiplexing of quantum memories is included. Understanding the limitations of achievable rates in the stationary regime for different network sizes is a fundamental step to comprehend scalability of quantum networks. This work investigates the behavior of the multipartite quantum repeater rate (i.e., the number of GHZ states generated per round and per memory) in the stationary regime in multipartite star graphs with a single central multipartite quantum repeater including multiplexing using Markov chains. We derive a closed-form expression for the stationary rate depending on the network size. We support our results with numerical simulations. Further, we show that the rate saturates for large number of memories. On an abstract level, the mathematical description is equivalent to quantum repeater chains between two parties. Therefore, our results also apply to those setups.</p>

            <p>Nonclassical mechanical states, as vital quantum resources for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior, have wide applications in the study of the fundamental quantum mechanics and modern quantum technology. In this work, we propose a scheme for deterministically generating non-classical mechanical states in cavity optomechanical systems.

Concretely, we employ the reinforcement learning method to optimize the pulsed driving fields, effectively suppressing the undesired transitions induced by both the pulsed driving fields and dissipations. This approach enables the high-fidelity preparation of phononic Fock states and superposed Fock states in the single-resonator optomechanical systems, as well as two-mode entangled states in the two-resonator optomechanical systems. The statistical properties of the generated states are also examined.

            <p>Steganography is the technique for transmitting a secret message by employing subterfuge to conceal it in innocent-looking data, rather than by overt security measures as in cryptography. Typically, non-degenerate quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are used as the cover medium, with the stego message disguised as noise. As in cryptography, a large number of bits or ebits are pre-shared, in this case mainly in order to ensure the innocence effect. In this work we develop three steganographic protocols: first, a scheme based on catalytic quantum codes to minimize initial pre-shared resources; second, a scheme incorporating prior entanglement into QECCs in the form of possibly degenerate entanglement-assisted QECCs; third, a scheme that uses the phase bit of a pre-shared ebit, combined with QECCs.</p>

In this work, we model charge-sensing-based readout for semiconductor spin qubits in double quantum dots, and identify key error mechanisms caused by the back-action of the charge sensor. We quantify how the charge noise of the sensor, residual tunneling, and $g$-tensor modulation degrade readout fidelity, induce a mixed post-measurement state, and cause leakage from the computational subspace. For state-of-the-art systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and electrically tunable $g$-tensors, we identify a readout sweet spot, that is, a special device configuration where readout is closest to projective. Our framework provides a foundation for developing effective readout error mitigation strategies, with broad applications for optimizing readout performance for a variety of charge-sensing techniques, advancing quantum protocols, and improving adaptive circuits for error correction.</p>

The ab initio modeling of such polaritonic phenomena has led to updating commonly used electronic structure methods, such as Hartree-Fock, density functional, and coupled cluster theories, to explicitly include Bosonic degrees of freedom. In this work, we explore the quantum electrodynamic auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QED-AFQMC) method to accurately capture the polaritonic ground state of representative quantum chemical benchmark systems to explore electron-photon correlations. We analyze these correlations across multiple examples and benchmark the QED-AFQMC results against other ab initio quantum electrodynamics methods, including QED-coupled cluster and QED-full configuration interaction, demonstrating the method's accuracy and its potential for scalable simulations of strongly coupled light-matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Magnonic entanglement in a chiral cavity-magnon coupling system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxin Kang, Xin Zeng, Wuji Zhang, Chunfang Sun, Chunfeng Wu, Gangcheng Wang</p>
            <p>The generation of magnon entanglement and squeezing plays a crucial role in quantum information processing. In this study, we propose a scheme based on a chiral cavity-magnon system, which consists of a torus-shaped cavity and two yttrium iron garnet spheres. The magnon mode of each yttrium iron garnet sphere is selectively coupled to one of the two degenerate rotating microwave modes of the toroidal cavity. The system aims to achieve entangled and squeezed magnon states through the mediation of the cavity. We further show that bipartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning external driving parameters. Additionally, our scheme does not rely on the magnon Kerr nonlinearity, which is usually extremely weak in yttrium iron garnet spheres. This work provides insights and methods for the research of quantum states in cavity-magnon systems.</p>

            <h2>Polaromechanics: cavity-magnon polaritons strongly coupled to phonons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui-Chang Shen, Jie Li, Yi-Ming Sun, Wei-Jiang Wu, Xuan Zuo, Yi-Pu Wang, Shi-Yao Zhu, J. Q. You</p>
            <p>Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel {\it polaromechanical} hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</p>

            <p>Topological phases are robust against weak perturbations, but break down when disorder becomes sufficiently strong. However, moderate disorder can also induce topologically nontrivial phases. Thouless pumping, as a (1+1)D counterpart of the integer quantum Hall effect, is one of the simplest manifestations of topology. Here, we report experimental observations of the competition and interplay between Thouless pumping and disorder on a 41-qubit superconducting quantum processor. We improve a Floquet engineering technique to realize cycles of adiabatic pumping by simultaneously varying the on-site potentials and the hopping couplings. We demonstrate Thouless pumping in the presence of disorder and show its breakdown as the strength of disorder increases. Moreover, we observe two types of topological pumping that are induced by on-site potential disorder and hopping disorder, respectively. In particular, an intrinsic topological pump that is induced by quasi-periodic hopping disorder has never been experimentally realized before. Our highly controllable system provides a valuable quantum simulating platform for studying various aspects of topological physics in the presence of disorder.</p>

            <p>We consider a system of two indistinguishable fermions (with four accessible states each) that suffers decoherence without dissipation due to its coupling with a global bosonic bath at a fixed temperature. Using an appropriate measure of fermionic entanglement, we identify families of two-fermion states whose entanglement persists throughout the evolution, either fully or partially, despite the noisy effects of the interaction with the bath, and independently of its temperature. The identified resilience to decoherence provides valuable insights into the entanglement dynamics of open systems of indistinguishable fermions, and into the conditions under which long-lived entanglement emerges under more general decoherence channels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik K. Marqversen, Janus H. Wesenberg, Nikolaj T. Zinner, Ulrik L. Andersen</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are particularly effective at correcting continuous noise, such as Gaussian noise and loss, and can significantly reduce overhead when concatenated with qubit error-correcting codes like surface codes. GKP error correction can be implemented using either a teleportation-based method, known as Knill error correction, or a quantum non-demolition-based approach, known as Steane error correction. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive performance analysis of these established GKP error correction schemes, deriving an analytical expression for the post-correction GKP squeezing and displacement errors. Our results show that there is flexibility in choosing the entangling gate used with the teleportation-based Knill approach. Furthermore, when implemented using the recently introduced qunaught states, the Knill approach not only achieves superior GKP squeezing compared to other variants but is also the simplest to realize experimentally in the optical domain.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Delocalization of Dark States in a Multimode Optical Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunyang Sun, Matthew Du, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>The strong coupling between molecules and photonic modes in a Fabry-Pérot optical cavity, which forms hybrid light-matter states called polaritons, has been demonstrated as a promising route to control the rates of chemical reactions. However, theoretical studies, which largely employ models with a single cavity mode, cannot explain the experimentally observed kinetic changes. While simplified multimode models with one spatial dimension can capture experimental features involving the polariton states, it is unclear whether they can also describe the dark states. Here, we study the delocalization of dark states for molecules in a multimode cavity, accounting for the three-dimensional nature of experimental setups. Accounting for energetic and orientational disorder, but fixing Rabi splitting and intermolecular distances (i.e., no positional disorder), we find that the delocalization of the dark states scales linearly with the number of molecules in the plane parallel to the cavity mirrors, in contrast to one-dimensional multimode models. Adding layers of molecules along the axis normal to the mirrors increases the delocalization much less. Similar to the one-dimensional models, the dark-state delocalization is enhanced for smaller values of molecular energetic disorder, relative to the light-matter coupling, and cavities with longer longitudinal length. Our work indicates that for certain phenomena, understanding the dark states under strong light-matter coupling might require a proper multimode description of the optical cavity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum technologies demand entanglement between many distant quantum emitters (QEs), for which we propose using high-$Q$, spatially extended bound states in the continuum (BICs) in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We show that QE-BIC coupling efficiencies ($\beta$-factors) can exceed $80\%$, comparable to waveguides even without further mode engineering, but within a 2D geometry that naturally accommodates large QE arrays and relaxes strict emitter placement. Inter-QE entanglement is generated faster than in free space, is significantly amplified, and persists over several resonant wavelengths. Optimality requires large $\beta$-factors but moderately small Purcell factors. Our results establish all-dielectric metasurfaces as a practical, scalable platform for leading-edge quantum photonics.</p>

            <h2>Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swarnabha Chattaraj, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the non-radiative resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO by a rather moderate cavity with Q~400, and equal suppression in the rate can be achieved by incorporating a significant energy mismatch between the electronic excitation and the cavity mode. Our framework is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.</p>

            <p>Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.</p>

            <h2>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yevhenii Morozov, Anatoliy Lapchuk</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Enhanced Channel Mixing in RWKV Models for Time Series Forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi-Sheng Chen, En-Jui Kuo</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in neural sequence modeling have led to architectures such as RWKV, which combine recurrent-style time mixing with feedforward channel mixing to enable efficient long-context processing. In this work, we propose QuantumRWKV, a hybrid quantum-classical extension of the RWKV model, where the standard feedforward network (FFN) is partially replaced by a variational quantum circuit (VQC). The quantum component is designed to enhance nonlinear representational capacity while preserving end-to-end differentiability via the PennyLane framework. To assess the impact of quantum enhancements, we conduct a comparative evaluation of QuantumRWKV and its purely classical counterpart across a suite of synthetic time-series forecasting tasks, including linear (ARMA), chaotic (Logistic Map), oscillatory (Damped Oscillation), and piecewise-regime signals. Our results reveal that the quantum-enhanced model achieves superior performance in several tasks characterized by nonlinear or chaotic dynamics-such as Chaotic Logistic, Noisy Damped Oscillator, and Sine Wave-while exhibiting limitations in tasks with sharp discontinuities or simple autoregressive structures. This study provides one of the first systematic comparisons between hybrid quantum-classical and classical recurrent models in temporal domains, highlighting when and how quantum circuits can offer tangible benefits in time-series learning. We conclude with a discussion on architectural trade-offs and potential future directions for expanding quantum integration into large-scale temporal learning systems.</p>

            <p>The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Robust Self-Testing: Detecting Non-Locality in Noisy Non-Local Inputs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romi Lifshitz</p>
            <p>Non-local games test for non-locality and entanglement in quantum systems and are used in self-tests for certifying quantum states in untrusted devices. However, these protocols are tailored to ideal states, so realistic noise prevents maximal violations and leaves many partially non-local states undetected. Selecting self-tests based on their 'robustness' to noise can tailor protocols to specific applications, but current literature lacks a standardized measure of noise-robustness. Creating such a measure is challenging as there is no operational measure for comparing tests of different dimensionalities and input-output settings. We propose and study three comparative measures: noise-tolerance, convincingness, and an analytic approximation of convincingness called the gapped score. Our computational experiments and analytic framework demonstrate that convincingness provides the most nuanced measure for noise-robustness. We then show that the CHSH game has the highest noise-robustness compared to more complex games (2-CHSH variants and the Magic Square Game) when given equal resources, while with unequal resources, some 2-CHSH variants can outperform CHSH at a high resource cost. This work provides the first systematic and operational framework for comparing noise-robustness in self-testing protocols, laying a foundation for theoretical advances in understanding noise-robustness of self-tests and practical improvements in quantum resource utilization.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is required for large-scale computation, but incurs a significant resource overhead. Recent advances have shown that by jointly decoding logical qubits in algorithms composed of transversal gates, the number of syndrome extraction rounds can be reduced by a factor of the code distance $d$, at the cost of increased classical decoding complexity. Here, we reformulate the problem of decoding transversal circuits by directly decoding relevant logical operator products as they propagate through the circuit. This procedure transforms the decoding task into one closely resembling that of a single-qubit memory propagating through time. The resulting approach leads to fast decoding and reduced problem size while maintaining high performance. Focusing on the surface code, we prove that this method enables fault-tolerant decoding with minimum-weight perfect matching, and benchmark its performance on example circuits including magic state distillation. We find that the threshold is comparable to that of a single-qubit memory, and that the total decoding run time can be, in fact, less than that of conventional lattice surgery. Our approach enables fast correlated decoding, providing a pathway to directly extend single-qubit QEC techniques to transversal algorithms.</p>

            <p>Transversal logical gates offer the opportunity for fast and low-noise logic, particularly when interspersed by a single round of parity check measurements of the underlying code. Using such circuits for the surface code requires decoding across logical gates, complicating the decoding task. We show how one can decode across an arbitrary sequence of transversal gates for the unrotated surface code, using a fast "logical observable" minimum-weight-perfect-matching (MWPM) based decoder, and benchmark its performance in Clifford circuits under circuit-level noise. We propose windowed logical observable matching decoders to address the problem of fully efficient decoding: our basic windowed decoder is computationally efficient under the restriction of quiescent (slow) resets. Our two-step windowed decoder can be computationally inefficient but allows fast resets. For both windowed decoders we identify errors which scale sublinearly in $d$ - depending on the structure of the circuit - which can lead to logical failure, and we propose methods to adapt the decoding to remove such failures. Our work highlights the complexity and interest in efficient decoding of fast logic for the surface code.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces Genesis, the first compiler designed to support Hamiltonian Simulation on hybrid continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum computing systems. Genesis is a two-level compilation system. At the first level, it decomposes an input Hamiltonian into basis gates using the native instruction set of the target hybrid CV-DV quantum computer. At the second level, it tackles the mapping and routing of qumodes/qubits to implement long-range interactions for the gates decomposed from the first level. Rather than a typical implementation that relies on SWAP primitives similar to qubit-based (or DV-only) systems, we propose an integrated design of connectivity-aware gate synthesis and beamsplitter SWAP insertion tailored for hybrid CV-DV systems. We also introduce an OpenQASM-like domain-specific language (DSL) named CVDV-QASM to represent Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli-exponentials and basic gate sequences from the hybrid CV-DV gate set. Genesis has successfully compiled several important Hamiltonians, including the Bose-Hubbard model, $\mathbb{Z}_2-$Higgs model, Hubbard-Holstein model, Heisenberg model and Electron-vibration coupling Hamiltonians, which are critical in domains like quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and quantum chemistry. Our implementation is available at Genesis-CVDV-Compiler(this https URL).</p>
