            <h2>Resolving the Quantum Measurement Problem through Leveraging the Uncertainty Principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyoung Yeon Kim</p>
            <p>The Schrodinger equation is incomplete, inherently unable to explain the collapse of the wavefunction caused by measurement; a fundamental issue known as the quantum measurement problem. Quantum mechanics is generally constrained by the uncertainty principle and, therefore, cannot interpret definite observations without uncertainty. Here, we resolve this enigma by demonstrating that in phase space quantum mechanics, particularly through the Wigner Moyal equation, uncertainty can be arbitrarily adjusted by tuning the observation window. An observation window much smaller than the uncertainty limit causes substantial nonlocality, rendering the problem ill posed. This suggests that only with sufficient uncertainty does nonlocality become bounded, resulting in a well posed universe. Conversely, in the absence of uncertainty, spacetime is warped beyond recognition, and the system exists as a superposition of numerous possible states. Measurement collapses this superposition into a unique solution, exhibiting timeless nonlocal interactions. Our framework bridges seemingly disparate concepts such as classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, decoherence, and measurement within intrinsic quantum mechanics even without invoking new theory.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Sensing with Driven-Dissipative Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar Arandes, Emil J. Bergholtz</p>
            <p>The remarkable sensitivity of non-Hermitian systems has been extensively studied and stimulated ideas about developing new types of sensors. In this paper, we examine a chain of parametrically driven coupled resonators governed by the squeezed Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emphasize the qualitative difference in sensor performance between configurations depending on bulk topology and boundary modes, specifically for detecting both on-site and non-Hermitian skin effect perturbations. Our analysis goes beyond the scenario of infinitesimal perturbations, extending to arbitrary perturbation strengths beyond the linear response regime. We stress the importance of optimizing the system's parameters to achieve quantum enhancement while avoiding fine-tuned regimes that could limit the practical applicability of this system for real-world quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>WaveguideQED.jl: An Efficient Framework for Simulating Non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matias Bundgaard-Nielsen, Dirk Englund, Mikkel Heuck, Stefan Krastanov</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a numerical framework designed to solve problems within the emerging field of Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (WQED). The framework is based on collision quantum optics, where a localized quantum system interacts sequentially with individual time-bin modes. This approach provides a physically intuitive model that allows researchers familiar with tools such as QuTiP in Python, Quantum Optics Toolbox for Matlab, or this http URL in Julia to efficiently set up and execute WQED simulations. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we demonstrate the framework's robust ability to handle complex WQED scenarios. These applications include the scattering of single- or two-photon pulses by quantum emitters or cavities, as well as the exploration of non-Markovian dynamics, where emitted photons are reflected back, thereby introducing feedback mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Experimental noiseless quantum amplification of coherent states of light by two-photon addition and subtraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Neset, Jiří Fadrný, Martin Bielak, Jaromír Fiurášek, Miroslav Ježek, Jan Bílek</p>
            <p>Noiseless quantum amplifiers are probabilistic quantum devices that enhance amplitude of coherent states without adding any noise, which has far reaching applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing. Here, we report on experimental implementation of an advanced noiseless quantum amplifier for coherent states of light that is based on conditional addition of two photons followed by conditional subtraction of two photons. We comprehensively characterize the noiselessly amplified coherent states via quantum state tomography and analyze the amplification gain and noise properties of the amplifier. We observe very good agreement between the experiment and theoretical predictions. Our work reveals that sequences of multiple photon additions and subtractions represent an efficient and experimentally feasible alternative to multiplexing that was originally proposed to boost the performance of noiseless quantum amplifiers. Beyond noiseless quantum amplification, our experiment represents a significant step forward towards engineering complex quantum operations on traveling light beams by coherent combinations of various sequences of multiphoton additions and subtractions.</p>

            <h2>Small but large: Single organic molecules as hybrid platforms for quantum technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Burak Gurlek, Daqing Wang</p>
            <p>Single organic molecules embedded in solid-state matrices exhibit remarkable optical properties, making them competitive candidates for single-photon sources and quantum nonlinear optical elements. However, the lack of long-lived internal states imposes significant constraints on their application in the broader field of quantum technologies. In this article, we reexamine the single-molecule host-guest system from first principles, elaborate on the rich internal states this system encompasses and put forward strategies to harness them for applications in quantum memory, spin-photon interface, spin register, and optomechanics. Further, we discuss the potential of leveraging the vast chemical space of molecules, and highlight the challenges and opportunities for molecular systems along these directions.</p>

            <h2>Bell's shadows from satellites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stav Haldar, Rachel L. McDonald, Sage Ducoing, Ivan Agullo</p>
            <p>Establishing reliable quantum links between a network of satellites and ground stations is a crucial step towards realizing a wide range of satellite-based quantum protocols, including global quantum networks, distributed sensing, quantum key distribution, and quantum clock synchronization. In this article, we envision a network of satellites and ground stations where quantum links are created through the exchange of entangled photon pairs. We simulate the dynamics of a satellite constellation and a set of Bell tests between the constellation and ground stations. We identify the regions on Earth where Bell tests can be successfully conducted with a satellite or a set of them, at a specified level of confidence. These regions move with the constellation and will be referred to as "Bell violation shadows". We demonstrate that these shadows provide valuable insights for the study and evaluation of many satellite-mediated or satellite-assisted quantum protocols.</p>

            <h2>Two-qubit gate protocols with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions in a linear Paul trap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph W. P. Wilkinson, Katrin Bolsmann, Thiago L. M. Guedes, Markus Müller, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>Ultracold trapped atomic ions excited into highly energetic Rydberg states constitute a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing. Elementary building blocks for such tasks are high-fidelity and sufficiently fast entangling two-qubit gates, which can be achieved via strong dipole-dipole interactions between microwave-dressed Rydberg ions, as recently demonstrated in a breakthrough experiment $[\href{this https URL}{1}]$. We theoretically investigate the performance of three protocols leading to controlled-phase gate operations. Starting from a microscopic description of Rydberg ions in a linear Paul trap, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that faithfully captures the essential dynamics underlying the gate protocols. We then use an optimization scheme to fine-tune experimentally controllable parameters like laser detuning and Rabi frequency to yield maximal gate fidelity under each studied protocol. We show how non-adiabatic transitions resulting from fast laser driving relative to the characteristic time scales of the system detrimentally affect the fidelity. Despite this, we demonstrate that in the realistic scenario of Rydberg ions with finite radiative lifetimes, optimizing the best found gate protocol enables achievement of fidelities as high as $99.25\,\%$ for a gate time of $0.2\,\mu\mathrm{s}$. This considerably undercuts entangling gate durations between ground-state ions, for which gate times are typically limited by the comparably slower time scales of vibrational modes. Overall, this places trapped Rydberg ions into the regime where fast high-accuracy quantum computing and eventually quantum error correction become possible.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathias Mikkelsen, Yuya O. Nakagawa</p>
            <p>Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) which define a subspace where we diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers to quantum chemistry calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathis Cohen, Laurent Labonté, Romain Dalidet, Sébastien Tanzilli, Anthony Martin</p>
            <p>The interference between two independent photons stands as a crucial aspect of numerous quantum information protocols and technologies. In this work, we leverage fiber-coupled devices, which encompass fibered photon pair-sources and off-the-shelf optics, to demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We employ two distinct single photon sources, namely an heralded single-photon source and a weak coherent laser source, both operating asynchronously in continuous-wave regime. We record two-photon coincidences, showing a state-of-art visibility of 91.9(5)\%. This work, compliant with telecom technology provides realistic backbones for establishing long-range communication based on quantum teleportation in hybrid quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optimization for Energy Management: A Coherent Variational Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization, and based on the comparative analysis, the best optimizer is selected. We evaluate our approaches on IEEE 3-, 5-, 118-, and 300-bus systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Our resource comparison between the power flow and OPF matrices on quantum hardware highlights that OPF needs considerably more resources, making its implementation significantly more challenging than in previous studies. Although promising, the application of CVQLS is currently constrained by the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially for larger power systems. To address this, we use a quantum noise simulator for testing on larger systems.</p>

            <h2>Hyperbolic Quantum Processor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgenii E. Narimanov, Eugene A. Demler</p>
            <p>Achieving strong coherent interaction between qubits separated by large distances holds the key to many important developments in quantum technology, including new designs of quantum computers, new platforms for quantum simulations and implementation of large scale quantum optical networks. However, the inherent mismatch between the spatial dimensions of a quantum emitter and the photon wavelength fundamentally limits the transmission of quantum entanglement over long distances. Here we demonstrate, that long-range qubit entanglement can be readily achieved when qubit interactions are mediated by optical polariton waves in a hyperbolic material, due to the phenomenon of the Hyperbolic Super-Resonance. We show that in this regime the resulting quantum gate fidelity that exceeds 99%, can be achieved with the use of qubits based on well known deep donors in silicon when their interactions are mediated by polariton fields in the substrate formed by a hyperbolic material (such as e.g. hexagonal boron nitride. At the physical level the proposed system is essentially a silicon-based optoelectronic chip, and it's readily accessible to the existing methods of semiconductor nanofabrication, leading to the integration densities of well over 10^8. qubits/cm^2, and therefore opening the way to scalable and fault-tolerant error correction in quantum computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, due to the optical time scales that define the duration of the gate operation in the proposed system, and sub-nanosecond time of the decoherence in deep donors in silicon at the liquid nitrogen temperatures, the proposed Hyperbolic Quantum Processor does not require dilution refrigeration and therefore offers a pathway to bring quantum computation to the realm of conventional engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yincheng Shi, Fengwen Wang, Dennis Høj, Ole Sigmund, Ulrik Lund Andersen</p>
            <p>High quality mechanical resonators are critical for driving advances in quantum information technologies, precision sensing, and optomechanics. However, achieving compact resonator designs that maintain high performance is a key challenge. In this study, we present a new class of compact resonators optimized to operate at higher-order eigenmodes, achieving both high frequencies and enhanced quality factor-frequency (Qf) products. By employing topology optimization to maximize the damping dilution factor, these resonators achieve minimized edge bending losses and enhanced intrinsic damping. Their high-(Qf) performance and compact form factor position these resonators as promising candidates for applications in quantum information transduction, advanced optomechanical systems, and next-generation sensing technologies.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Quantum Synchronization in a driven qubit system coupled to a structured environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Hossein Houshmand Almani, Ali Mortezapour, Alireza Nourmandipour</p>
            <p>In this paper, we delve into the issue of Quantum Synchronization in a driven two-level (qubit) system situated within a structured environment. Our findings have practical implications as we discover that adding a time-dependent periodic modulation to the transition frequency of the qubit can significantly enhance quantum synchronization. We first discovered the phase preference and, consequently, the phase locking conditions in our system using the Husimi Q-function. It is revealed that combining frequency modulation and non-Markovian effects enables us to achieve a stable phase-locking for the system. We show that tuning the amplitude-tofrequency ratio of the modulation process on the zeros of the zeroth-order Bessel function led to phase locking and, thus, surprisingly enhances quantum synchronization in the system. These results provide new insights into efficiently understanding phase dynamics in quantum environments.</p>

            <p>Exploiting quantum effects of mechanical motion, such as backaction evading measurements or squeezing, requires preparation of the oscillator in a high-purity state. The largest state purities in optomechanics to date have relied on cryogenic cooling, combined with coupling to electromagnetic resonators driven with a coherent radiation field. In this work, we cool the mega-hertz-frequency librational mode of an optically levitated silica nanoparticle from room temperature to its quantum ground state. Cooling is realized by coherent scattering into a Fabry-Perot cavity. We use sideband thermometry to infer a phonon population of 0.04 quanta under optimal conditions, corresponding to a state purity of 92%. The purity reached by our room-temperature experiment exceeds the performance offered by mechanically clamped oscillators in a cryogenic environment. Our work establishes a platform for high-purity quantum optomechanics at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</p>

            <h2>Relativistic particles in super-periodic potentials: exploring graphene and fractal systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudhanshu Shekhar, Bhabani Prasad Mandal, Anirban Dutta</p>
            <p>In this article, we employ the transfer matrix method to investigate relativistic particles in super-periodic potentials (SPPs) of arbitrary order $n \in I^{+}$. We calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities for spinless Klein particles encountering rectangular potential barriers with super-periodic repetition. It is found that spinless relativistic particles exhibit Klein tunneling and a significantly higher degree of reflection compared to their non-relativistic counterparts. Additionally, we analytically explore the behavior of experimentally realizable massless Dirac electrons as they encounter rectangular potential barriers with a super-periodic pattern in a monolayer of graphene. In this system, the transmission probability, conductance, and Fano factor are evaluated as functions of the number of barriers, the order of super-periodicity, and the angle of incidence. Our findings reveal that the transmission probability shows a series of resonances that depend on the number of barriers and the order of super-periodicity. We extend our analysis to specific cases within the Unified Cantor Potentials (UCPs)-$\gamma$ system ($\gamma$ is a scaling parameter greater than $1$), focusing on the General Cantor fractal system and the General Smith-Volterra-Cantor (GSVC) system. For the General Cantor fractal system, we calculate the tunneling probability, which reveals sharp transmission peaks and progressively thinner unit cell potentials as $G$ increases. In the GSVC system, we analyze the potential segment length and tunneling probability, observing nearly unity tunneling coefficients when $\gamma \approx 1$, as well as saturation behavior in transmission coefficients at higher stages $G$.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Clausius inequalities and entanglement production in holographic two-dimensional CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Kibe, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Pratik Roy</p>
            <p>Utilizing quantum information theory, it has been shown that irreversible entropy production is bounded from both below and above in physical processes. Both these bounds are positive and generalize the Clausius inequality. Such bounds are, however, obtained from distance measures in the space of states, which are hard to define and compute in quantum field theories. We show that the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) can be utilized to obtain both lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production for quenches leading to transitions between thermal states carrying uniform momentum density in two dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We achieve this by refining earlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT surfaces in arbitrary Bañados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches involving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal states) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and thermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final temperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of entanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy density and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large entangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established. Finally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement entropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined understanding of scrambling of quantum information.</p>

            <p>Uncertainty principle is one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Exploring such uncertainty relations in pre- and postselected (PPS) systems, where weak measurements on post-selected states have been used as a powerful tool for exploring the foundation of quantum mechanics, has so far eluded experimental effort. In this work, we experimentally investigate the Robertson-Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation for two incompatible observables in a PPS system. Through conducting a von Neumann-type measurement, uncertainty relations between two non-commuting Pauli observables are experimentally unveiled. Such uncertainty relations in the PPS system impose limitations on the joint sharp preparation of pre- and postselected states for two incompatible observables. Our experiments would be useful for the development of amplification techniques for precision measurements.</p>

            <h2>Device-independent uncloneable encryption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srijita Kundu, Ernest Y.-Z. Tan</p>
            <p>Uncloneable encryption, first introduced by Broadbent and Lord (TQC 2020) is a quantum encryption scheme in which a quantum ciphertext cannot be distributed between two non-communicating parties such that, given access to the decryption key, both parties cannot learn the underlying plaintext. In this work, we introduce a variant of uncloneable encryption in which several possible decryption keys can decrypt a particular encryption, and the security requirement is that two parties who receive independently generated decryption keys cannot both learn the underlying ciphertext. We show that this variant of uncloneable encryption can be achieved device-independently, i.e., without trusting the quantum states and measurements used in the scheme, and that this variant works just as well as the original definition in constructing quantum money. Moreover, we show that a simple modification of our scheme yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme, which was a related notion introduced by Georgiou and Zhandry. In particular, the resulting single-decryptor encryption scheme achieves device-independent security with respect to a standard definition of security against random plaintexts. Finally, we derive an "extractor" result for a two-adversary scenario, which in particular yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme for single bit-messages that achieves perfect anti-piracy security without needing the quantum random oracle model.</p>

            <p>Open microcavities offer great potential for the exploration and utilization of efficient spin-photon interfaces with Purcell-enhanced quantum emitters thanks to their large spectral and spatial tunability combined with high versatility of sample integration. However, a major challenge for this platform is the sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations in the cryogenic environment, which leads to cavity resonance frequency variations and thereby a lowered averaged Purcell enhancement. This work presents a closed-cycle cryogenic fiber-based microcavity setup, which is in particular designed for a low passive vibration level, while still providing large tunability and flexibility in fiber and sample integration, and high photon collection efficiency from the cavity mode. At temperatures below 10 Kelvin, a stability level of around 25 picometer is reproducibly achieved in different setup configurations, including the extension with microwave control for manipulating the spin of cavity-coupled quantum emitters, enabling a bright photonic interface with optically active qubits.</p>

            <h2>Bath Dynamical Decoupling with a Quantum Channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Hahn, Kazuya Yuasa, Daniel Burgarth</p>
            <p>Bang-bang dynamical decoupling protects an open quantum system from decoherence due to its interaction with the surrounding bath/environment. In its standard form, this is achieved by strongly kicking the system with cycles of unitary operations, which average out the interaction Hamiltonian. In this paper, we generalize the notion of dynamical decoupling to repeated kicks with a quantum channel, which is applied to the bath. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the employed quantum channel and find that bath dynamical decoupling works if and only if the kick is ergodic. Furthermore, we study in which circumstances CPTP kicks on a mono-partite quantum system induce quantum Zeno dynamics with its Hamiltonian cancelled out. This does not require the ergodicity of the kicks, and the absence of decoherence-free subsystems is both necessary and sufficient. While the standard unitary dynamical decoupling is essentially the same as the quantum Zeno dynamics, our investigation implies that this is not true any more in the case of CPTP kicks. To derive our results, we prove some spectral properties of ergodic quantum channels, that might be of independent interest. Our approach establishes an enhanced and unified mathematical understanding of several recent experimental demonstrations and might form the basis of new dynamical decoupling schemes that harness environmental noise degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Sharp finite statistics for quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaisakh Mannalath, Víctor Zapatero, Marcos Curty</p>
            <p>The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on statistical inference. For a broad class of protocols, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, customarily addressed using exponential tail bounds on the hypergeometric distribution. Here we devise a strikingly simple exponential bound for this task, of unprecedented tightness among QKD security analyses. As a by-product, confidence intervals for the average of non-identical Bernoulli parameters follow too. These naturally fit in statistical analyses of decoy-state QKD and also outperform standard tools. Lastly, we show that, in a vast parameter regime, the use of tail bounds is not enforced because the cumulative mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is accurately computable. This sharply decreases the minimum block sizes necessary for QKD, and reveals the tightness of our simple analytical bounds when moderate-to-large blocks are considered.</p>

This representation provides a rich visualization of quantum operators by depicting them as shapes assembled as a linear combination of spherical harmonics. These shapes can be experimentally tomographed using a scanning-based phase-space tomography approach. However, so far, this approach was limited to $\textit{known}$ target processes and only provided information about the controlled version of the process rather than the process itself. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a general protocol to extend Wigner tomography to $\textit{unknown}$ unitary processes. This new method enables experimental tomography by combining a set of experiments with classical post-processing algorithms introduced herein to reconstruct the unknown process. We also demonstrate the tomography approach experimentally on IBM quantum devices and present the specific calibration circuits required for quantifying undesired errors in the measurement outcomes of these demonstrations.</p>

            <h2>Magic State Injection on IBM Quantum Processors Above the Distillation Threshold</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Younghun Kim, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman</p>
            <p>The surface code family is a promising approach to implementing fault-tolerant quantum computations. Universal fault-tolerance requires error-corrected non-Clifford operations, in addition to Clifford gates, and for the former, it is imperative to experimentally demonstrate additional resources known as magic states. Another challenge is to efficiently embed surface codes into quantum hardware with connectivity constraints. This work simultaneously addresses both challenges by employing a qubit-efficient rotated heavy-hexagonal surface code for IBM quantum processors (\texttt{ibm\_fez}) and implementing the magic state injection protocol. Our work reports error thresholds for both logical bit- and phase-flip errors, of $\approx0.37\%$ and $\approx0.31\%$, respectively, which are higher than the threshold values previously reported with traditional embedding. The post-selection-based preparation of logical magic states $|H_L\rangle$ and $|T_L\rangle$ achieve fidelities of $0.8806\pm0.0002$ and $0.8665\pm0.0003$, respectively, which are both above the magic state distillation threshold. Additionally, we report the minimum fidelity among injected arbitrary single logical qubit states as $0.8356\pm0.0003$. Our work demonstrates the potential for realising non-Clifford logical gates by producing high-fidelity logical magic states on IBM quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Observables of Quantized Fluxes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber</p>
            <p>While it has become widely appreciated that defining (higher) gauge theories requires, in addition to ordinary phase space data, also "flux quantization" laws in generalized differential cohomology, there has been little discussion of the general rules, if any, for lifting Poisson-brackets of (flux-)observables and their quantization from traditional phase spaces to the resulting higher moduli stacks of flux-quantized gauge fields. In this short note, we present a systematic analysis of (i) the canonical quantization of flux observables in Yang-Mills theory and (ii) of valid flux quantization laws in abelian Yang-Mills, observing (iii) that the resulting topological quantum observables form the homology Pontrjagin algebra of the loop space of the moduli space of flux-quantized gauge fields. This is remarkable because the homology Ponrjagin algebra on loops of moduli makes immediate sense in broad generality for higher and non-abelian (non-linearly coupled) gauge fields, such as for the C-field in 11d supergravity, where it recovers the quantum effects previously discussed in the context of "Hypothesis H".</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janet Zhong, Heming Wang, Shanhui Fan</p>
            <p>There have been several criteria for the existence of topological edge states in 1D non-Hermitian two-band sublattice-symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonians. The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) approach uses the integration of the Berry connection over the GBZ contour in the complex wavevector space. An alternate `pole-zero' approach uses algebraic properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the sublattice-symmetric Hamiltonian in off-diagonal form. Both correctly predict the presence or absence of edge states, but there has not been an explicit proof of their equivalence. Here we provide such an explicit proof and moreover we extend the pole-zero approach so that it also applies for sublattice-symmetric models when the Hamiltonian is not in off-diagonal form. We give numerical examples for these invariants.</p>

            <p>We study the discrete quantum walk on a regular graph $X$ that assigns negative identity coins to marked vertices $S$ and Grover coins to the unmarked ones. We find combinatorial bases for the eigenspaces of the transtion matrix, and derive a formula for the average vertex mixing matrix $\AMM$. We then find bounds for entries in $\AMM$, and study when these bounds are tight. In particular, the average probabilities between marked vertices are lower bounded by a matrix determined by the induced subgraph $X[S]$, the vertex-deleted subgraph $X\backslash S$, and the edge deleted subgraph $X-E(S)$. We show this bound is achieved if and only if the marked vertices have walk-equitable neighborhoods in the vertex-deleted subgraph. Finally, for quantum walks attaining this bound, we determine when $\AMM[S,S]$ is symmetric, positive semidefinite or uniform.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect.

Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</p>

            <h2>Error and Resource Estimates of Variational Quantum Algorithms for Solving Differential Equations Based on Runge-Kutta Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Dechant, Liubov Markovich, Vedran Dunjko, Jordi Tura</p>
            <p>A focus of recent research in quantum computing has been on developing quantum algorithms for differential equations solving using variational methods on near-term quantum devices. A promising approach involves variational algorithms, which combine classical Runge-Kutta methods with quantum computations. However, a rigorous error analysis, essential for assessing real-world feasibility, has so far been lacking. In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of error sources and determine the resource requirements needed to achieve specific target errors. In particular, we derive analytical error and resource estimates for scenarios with and without shot noise, examining shot noise in quantum measurements and truncation errors in Runge-Kutta methods. Our analysis does not take into account representation errors and hardware noise, as these are specific to the instance and the used device. We evaluate the implications of our results by applying them to two scenarios: classically solving a $1$D ordinary differential equation and solving an option pricing linear partial differential equation with the variational algorithm, showing that the most resource-efficient methods are of order 4 and 2, respectively. This work provides a framework for optimizing quantum resources when applying Runge-Kutta methods, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy in both solving differential equations and simulating quantum systems. Further, this work plays a crucial role in assessing the suitability of these variational algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The results may also be of interest to the numerical analysis community as they involve the accumulation of errors in the function description, a topic that has hardly been explored even in the context of classical differential equation solvers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Luis Colmenarez, Markus Müller, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry protected fermion matter.</p>

            <p>We consider the selective sensing of planar waves in the presence of noise. We present different methods to control the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network, which allow one to decouple it from arbitrarily selected waves while retaining sensitivity to the signal. Comparing these methods with classical (non-entangled) sensor networks we demonstrate two advantages. First, entanglement increases precision by enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Second, entanglement enables the elimination of correlated noise processes corresponding to waves with different propagation directions, by exploiting decoherence-free subspaces. We then provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of the advantage offered by entangled quantum sensor networks, which is not specific to waves and can be of general interest. We demonstrate an exponential advantage in the regime where the number of sensor locations is comparable to the number of noise sources. Finally, we outline a generalization to other waveforms, e.g., spherical harmonics and general time-dependent fields.</p>

            <p>The efficient detection of light from trapped ions in free space is paramount for most of their applications. We propose a scheme to enhance the photon collection from linear ion strings. It employs the constructive interference of light scattered from ions along the axial direction in linear Paul traps. The coherent enhancement of photon collection is numerically optimized for a range of feasible spatial angles and realistic ion positions in a single harmonic Coulomb potential. Despite the large mutual distance of scatterers on the order of many wavelengths of scattered light, presented experimental tests confirm the feasibility of enhancements by a factor of $3.05 \pm 0.09$ with a crystal of nine $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Further significant improvements using different ion species, which allow for suppression of the sensitivity to the residual thermal motion, are predicted. The proposed collection geometry is intrinsic to diverse linear ion trap designs and the methodology can be directly applied to an observation of scattering from ion crystals prepared in collective electronic excitations.</p>

            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ansätze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p>Using second-order perturbation theory in the light-matter interaction, we derive an analytical approximation for the vibronic populations of a diatomic system excited by ultrabroadband frequency entangled photons and evaluate the population dynamics for different degrees of entanglement between photon pairs. Our analytical approach make the same predictions as previously derived via numerical solutions of the complete Schrödinger equation [H. Oka, Physical Review A 97, 063859 (2018)], with the added advantage of providing clear physical insights into the vibronic selectivity as a function of the degree of photon correlations while requiring significantly reduced computational effort. Specifically, our analytical expression for the probability of vibronic excitation includes a factor which predicts the enhancement of vibrational selectivity as a function of the degree correlation between the entangled photon pairs, the targeted vibrational energy level, and the vibrational molecular structure encoded in the Franck-Condon factors. Our results illustrate the importance of going beyond the usual approximations in second-order perturbation theory to capture the relevance of the vibrational structure of the molecular system of interest in order to gain a deeper understanding of the possible quantum-enhancement provided by the interaction between quantum light and matter.</p>

            <p>Complete characterization of a multimode optical process has paved the way for understanding complex optical phenomena, leading to the development of novel optical technologies. Until now, however, characterizations have mainly focused on a linear-optical process, despite the plethora of multimode nonlinear-optical processes crucial for photonic technologies. Here we report the experimental characterization of multimode nonlinear-optical quantum processes by obtaining the full information needed to describe them while satisfying the necessary physical condition. Specifically, to characterize a second-order nonlinear-optical process of parametric downconversion, we determine the amplification and noise matrices of multimode field quadratures. The full information allows us to factorize the multimode process, leading to the identification of eigenquadratures and their associated amplification and noise properties. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our method by characterizing various nonlinear-optical quantum processes, including cluster state generation, mode-dependent loss with nonlinear interaction, and a quantum noise channel. Our method, by providing a versatile technique for characterizing a nonlinear-optical process, will be beneficial for developing scalable photonic technologies.</p>

            <p>Building on the approach of stochastic thermodynamics, we define entropy production for arbitrary quantum processes, using Bayesian tools to capture the inherent subjective element. First, we show that the classical expression for average entropy production involves only comparisons of statistics at the input or output, and thus can be formally generalized by replacing probability distributions by quantum states. To go beyond the mere average, we construct an entropy production operator, that generalizes the value of entropy to the non-commutative case. The operator is Hermitian; its average is non-negative, so that the Second Law takes its usual form $\langle\Sigma\rangle\geq 0$; it formally satisfies the Jarzynski equality; and recovers the classical expression for classical processes. We also present features whose fully quantum version is not a straightforward translation of the classical one: these may point to the core difference between classical and quantum thermodynamics.</p>

Here, by coupling an single neutral atom with a high-finesse fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity (FFPC) in Purcell regime, we realize strong enhancement of the atomic photoemission rate, which enables ultrafast and high-fidelity discrimination of bright and dark hyperfine states of the atom. The readout fidelity can reach 99.1(2)% within 200 ns and 99.985(8)% within 9 $\mu$s.

            <p>Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries.

By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</p>

            <p>Phononic crystals are a promising platform for the study of quantum acoustodynamics. In a recent experiment, the interaction of a superconducting quantum bit with modes of a phononic crystal has been demonstrated. The field of these modes is localized in a compact area, providing high values of the coupling constant with the qubit. However, the Q-factor of phononic crystal modes is strongly limited (1050) due to a phonon emission from the crystal ends. For further use of phononic crystals in research in the field of quantum acoustodynamics, it is desirable to overcome this limitation in the quality factor. In this work, we have proposed a structure consisting of a phononic crystal placed between the Bragg mirrors. Our simulations predict that the Q-factor in such a structure can reach (100000). We demonstrate experimental results in which this structure has a Q-factor (60,000), which is 60 times higher than that of an acoustic crystal of the same size.</p>

            <p>The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p>Non-destructive heralded entanglement with photons is a valuable resource for quantum information processing. However, they generally entail ancillary particles and modes that amplify the circuit intricacy. To address this challenge, a recent work (\href{this https URL}{npj Quantum Information 10, 67 (2024)}) introduced a graph approach for creating multipartite entanglements with boson subtractions. Nonetheless, it remains an essential intermediate step toward practical heralded schemes: the proposition of heralded subtraction operators in bosonic linear quantum networks. This research establishes comprehensive translation rules from subtraction operators to linear optical operators, which provides a seamless path to design heralded schemes with single photons. Our method begets enhanced or previously unreported schemes for the $N$-partite GHZ state with $2N$ photons, $N$-partite W state with $2N+1$ photons and superposition of $N=3$ GHZ and W states with 9 photons. Our streamlined approach can straightforwardly design heralded schemes for multipartite entangled states by assembling the operators according to the guidence of sculpting bigraphs, hence significantly simplifies the quantum circuit design process.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit coupling is of fundamental interest in both quantum optical and condensed matter systems alike. In this work, we show that optically induced electronic excitations in lattices of V-type atoms exhibit an emergent spin-orbit coupling when the geometry is chiral. This spin-orbit coupling arises naturally from the electric dipole interaction between the atomic sites and leads to a nontrivial topology for the lattice band structure. Using a general quantum optical model, we determine analytically the conditions that give rise to spin-orbit coupling and characterize the behavior under various symmetry transformations. We demonstrate that chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling can result from either the chirality of the underlying lattice geometry or the combination of an achiral lattice with a suitably chosen external quantization axis. We then discuss how these results are influenced by dissipation, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and illuminates the distinction between true and false chirality. Our results demonstrate that chiral atom arrays are a robust platform for realizing spin-orbit-coupled topological states of matter.</p>

            <h2>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Tian Li, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Huai-Bing Zhu, Simon Gröblacher, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum delocalization of a 1-milligram torsional pendulum for gravity experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofia Agafonova, Pere Rossello, Manuel Mekonnen, Onur Hosten</p>
            <p>Reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics has posed significant challenges in contemporary physics. Even the seemingly simple question of whether gravitational fields should obey the quantum superposition principle remains unanswered. Unlocking the answer experimentally necessitates a quantum-unfriendly regime with large masses and low-frequency dynamics to maximize the dimensionless figure-of-merit in the problem, quantifying the ability to generate quantum entanglement gravitationally. To this end, we develop a 1-milligram torsional pendulum operating at 18 Hz. Laser cooling its motion to an unprecedented 240~microkelvins for this mass range, we boost its quantum delocalization and benchmark a state-of-the-art quantum-gravity figure-of-merit with an unparalleled improvement potential. The results open a frontier for explorations of quantum aspects of gravity, establishing milligram-scale torsional pendulums as a leading platform.</p>

            <h2>Black Hole Multi-Entropy Curves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Norihiro Iizuka, Simon Lin, Mitsuhiro Nishida</p>
            <p>We investigate the multi-partite entanglement structure of an evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation by dividing the radiation into finer subsystems. Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</p>
