            <h2>Shot-Efficient ADAPT-VQE via Reused Pauli Measurements and Variance-Based Shot Allocation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Azhar Ikhtiarudin, Gagus Ketut Sunnardianto, Fadjar Fathurrahman, Mohammad Kemal Agusta, Hermawan Kresno Dipojono</p>
            <p>The Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising approach for quantum algorithms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, offering advantages over traditional VQE methods by reducing circuit depth and mitigating challenges in classical optimization. However, a major challenge in ADAPT-VQE is the high quantum measurement (shot) overhead required for circuit parameter optimization and operator selection. In this work, we propose two integrated strategies to reduce the shot requirements in ADAPT-VQE. First, we reuse Pauli measurement outcomes obtained during VQE parameter optimization in the subsequent operator selection step of the next ADAPT-VQE iteration, which involves operator gradient measurements. Second, we apply variance-based shot allocation to both Hamiltonian and operator gradient measurements. Our numerical results demonstrate that each method, individually and in combination, significantly reduces the number of shots needed to achieve chemical accuracy while maintaining result fidelity across the studied molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>Many-body delocalization with a two-dimensional 70-qubit superconducting quantum simulator</h2>

            <p>Quantum many-body systems with sufficiently strong disorder can exhibit a non-equilibrium phenomenon, known as the many-body localization (MBL), which is distinct from conventional thermalization. While the MBL regime has been extensively studied in one dimension, its existence in higher dimensions remains elusive, challenged by the avalanche instability. Here, using a 70-qubit two-dimensional (2D) superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally explore the robustness of the MBL regime in controlled finite-size 2D systems. We observe that the decay of imbalance becomes more pronounced with increasing system sizes, scaling up from 21, 42 to 70 qubits, with a relatively large disorder strength, and for the first time, provide an evidence for the many-body delocalization in 2D disordered systems. Our experimental results are consistent with the avalanche theory that predicts the instability of MBL regime beyond one spatial dimension. This work establishes a scalable platform for probing high-dimensional non-equilibrium phases of matter and their finite-size effects using superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Computational-Sensing Advantage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeed A. Khan, Sridhar Prabhu, Logan G. Wright, Peter L. McMahon</p>
            <p>Quantum computing has the potential to deliver large advantages on computational tasks, but advantages for practical tasks are not yet achievable with current hardware. Quantum sensing is an entirely separate quantum technology that can provide its own kind of a quantum advantage. In this Perspective, we explain how the merger of quantum sensing with quantum computing has recently given rise to the notion of quantum computational sensing, and a new kind of quantum advantage: a quantum computational-sensing advantage. This advantage can be realized with far lower hardware requirements than purely computational quantum advantage. We explain how several recent proposals and experiments can be understood as quantum computational sensing, and discuss categorizations of the general architectures that quantum-computational-sensing protocols can have. We conclude with an outlook on open questions and the prospects for quantum computational sensors and quantum computational-sensing advantage.</p>

            <h2>Quantum synchronization between two strongly driven YIG spheres mediated via a microwave cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jatin Ghildiyal, Shubhrangshu Dasgupta, Asoka Biswas</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical study of synchronization between two strongly driven magnon modes indirectly coupled via a single-mode microwave cavity. Each magnon mode, hosted in separate Yttrium Iron Garnet spheres, interacts coherently with the cavity field, leading to cavity-mediated nonlinear coupling. We show, by using input-output formalism, that both classical and quantum synchronization emerge for appropriate choices of coupling, detuning, and driving. We find that thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Beatings in Optical Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ishaan Ganti, Jianshu Cao</p>
            <p>Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling, are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Rabi oscillations and entanglement between two atoms interacting by the Rydberg blockade studied by the Jaynes-Cummings Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco D. Santillan, Andreas Hanke</p>
            <p>The interaction between atoms and a quantized radiation field is fundamentally important in quantum optics and quantum information science. Due to their unusual properties, Rydberg atoms are promising building blocks for two-qubit gates and atom-light quantum interfaces, exploiting the Rydberg blockade interaction, which prevents two atoms at close distance from being simultaneously excited to Rydberg states. Recently, this effect was used to engineer quantum processors based on arrays of interacting Rydberg atoms illuminated by Raman lasers. Motivated by these experiments, we extend the Jaynes-Cummings model to study the interaction between two Rydberg atoms interacting by the Rydberg blockade and a quantized radiation field. We consider both number (Fock) states of the field and single-mode quantum coherent states. In particular, we discuss different types of entanglements between various components of the total system consisting of the two Rydberg-interacting atoms and coherent states of the field, and show that the behavior is significantly different compared to a system with non-interacting atoms corresponding to the two-atom Tavis-Cummings model. Our results are relevant in view of atom-light quantum interfaces as components for future long-distance quantum communication.</p>

            <h2>Many-body enhancement of energy storage in a waveguide-QED quantum battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore Tirone, Gian Marcello Andolina, Giuseppe Calajò, Vittorio Giovannetti, Davide Rossini</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries have demonstrated remarkable charging properties, showing that a quantum advantage is possible in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. However, finding an effective strategy to store energy for long periods remains crucial in these systems. Here, we investigate different configurations of a waveguide-QED system acting as a quantum battery and show that, in this context, collective effects can slow down the self-discharging time of the battery, thus improving the storage time. Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maritza Ahumada, Natalia Valderrama-Quinteros, Diego Tancara, Guillermo Romero</p>
            <p>Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional systems is pivotal for quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model, where each lattice unit integrates a single-mode resonator that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLSs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and qubit-qubit interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insights into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Quasinormal Mode Theory for Dissipative Nano-Optics and Magnetodielectric Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Meschede, Daniel D. A. Clarke, Ortwin Hess</p>
            <p>The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations equivalently convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Complementarity ad Infinitum: Switching Higher-Order Coherence from Infinity to Zero</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>We report a profound manifestation of quantum complementarity in the higher-order photon statistics of the ``Janus state,'' a coherent superposition of two squeezed vacua. We find that the state acts as a perfect quantum switch for multi-photon correlations, toggled by the availability of which-path information. Erasing this information activates quantum interference that can be tuned to be maximally destructive. This reveals a remarkable hierarchy of suppression: while two-photon correlations remain finite, we prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that it is possible to drive all higher-order correlations ($g^{(k)}$ for $k \ge 3$) to zero. This transition from the extreme bunching of the constituent states ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to a state of profound quantum order is visualized by the emergence of negativity in the state's Wigner function, an unambiguous signature of non-classicality. This work provides a foundational demonstration of quantum complementarity in multi-photon statistics and introduces a new paradigm for engineering highly ordered, non-classical light from Gaussian resources.</p>

            <h2>Tunneling driven by quantum light described via field Bohmian trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sangwon Kim, Seongjin Ahn, Denis V. Seletskiy, Andrey S. Moskalenko</p>
            <p>Recent realization of an intense quantum light, namely bright squeezed vacuum, opened a new perspective on quantum light-matter interaction. Several theoretical works have appeared based on coherent state expansions of quantum state of light to investigate non-classical driving of high-harmonic generation in atomic gases and solids, or free-electron dynamics, but their predictions surprisingly coincide with what one could expect from essentially classical interpretations of the light statistics. A deeper theoretical insight into the underlying physics is necessary for understanding of observed experimental findings and predicting emerging effects relying on this new configuration. Here we present a theoretical framework to describe tunneling driven by quantum light, where the properties of such light are captured by a statistical ensemble of classical fields via a hydrodynamic, also referred to as Bohmian, formulation. Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling driven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of tunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one realization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on the measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian trajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the electron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical) real classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical approach. To illustrate this, we consider BSV-induced electron transport from the tip to the surface in the tunneling microscope configuration demonstrating the transition from the multiphoton to the direct tunneling regime.</p>

            <h2>Schr{ö}dinger cat state formation in small bosonic Josephson junctions at finite temperatures and dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D V Tsarev, D V Ansimov, S A Podoshvedov, A P Alodjants</p>
            <p>In this work, we consider the feasibility of Schr{ö}dinger cat (SC) and $N00N$ states formation by a convenient bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) system in two-mode approximation. Starting with purely quantum description of two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate we investigate the effective potential approach that provides an accurate analytical description for the system with a large number of particles. We show that in the zero temperature limit SC states result from a quantum phase transition that occurs when the nonlinear strength becomes comparable with the Josephson coupling parameter. The Wigner function approach demonstrates the growth of the SC state halves separation and formation of $N00N$-like states (a Fock state superposition) with the particle number increase. We examine the possibility to attain the SC state at finite temperatures and a weak dissipation leading to appearing of some critical temperature; it defines the second-order phase transition from classical activation process to the SC state formation through the quantum tunneling phenomenon. Numerical estimations demonstrate that the critical temperature is sufficiently below the temperature of atomic condensation. The results obtained may be useful for experimental observation of SC states with small condensate Josephson junctions.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement-Efficient Compilation of Quantum Circuits over Large-Scale Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Burt, Kuan-Cheng Chen, Kin K. Leung</p>
            <p>Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However, connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.</p>

            <h2>Engineering Non-Hermitian Quantum Evolution Using a Hermitian Bath Environment</h2>

            <p>Engineering quantum bath networks through non-Hermitian subsystem Hamiltonians has recently emerged as a promising strategy for qubit cooling, state stabilization, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, scaling these systems while maintaining precise control over their complex interconnections, especially in the optical domain, poses significant challenges in both theoretical modeling and physical implementation. In this work, drawing on principles from quantum and mathematical physics, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing non-Hermitian subsystems within entirely Hermitian photonic platforms. In particular, controlled exponential decay without actual absorption loss is realized in finite 1-D waveguide chains through discrete-to-continuum coupling and Lanczos transformations. Using this new methodology, we implement parity-time symmetric quantum systems and experimentally demonstrate that these artificial bath environments accurately replicate the dynamics of non-Hermitian arrangements in both single- and multi-photon excitation regimes. Since the non-Hermitian subsystem response deterministically arises from an artificially built Hermitian bath, the quantum evolution can be monitored via post-selection in this fully conservative configuration. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental realizations, thus paving the way for exploiting quantum bath engineering in advanced information processing and emerging quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>High temperature superradiant phase transition in novel quantum structures with complex network interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.Yu. Bazhenov, M. Nikitina, Alexander Alodjants</p>
            <p>In the present work we propose a novel quantum material concept, which enables super- and/or ultrastrong interaction of two-level systems with the photonic field in a complex network. Within the mean field approximation we examine phase transition to superradiance that results in two excitation (polariton) branches and is accompanied by the appearance of non-zero macroscopic polarization of two-level systems. We characterize the statistical properties of networks by the first, ${\langle}k{\rangle}$, and second normalized, $\zeta\equiv{\langle}k^2{\rangle}/{\langle}k{\rangle}$, moments for node degree distribution. We have shown that the Rabi frequency is essentially enhanced due to the topology of the network within the anomalous domain where ${\langle}k{\rangle}$ and $\zeta$ sufficiently grow. The multichannel (multimode) structure of matter-field interaction leads superstrong coupling that provides primary behavior of the high temperature phase transition. The results obtained pave the way to design new photonic and polaritonic circuits, quantum networks for efficient processing quantum information at high (room) temperatures.</p>

            <h2>A Mixed-Order Phase Transition in Continuous-Variable Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaqi Zhao, Kan He, Yongtao Zhang, Jinchuan Hou, Jianxi Gao, Shlomo Havlin, Xiangyi Meng</p>
            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) have been predominantly driven by discrete-variable (DV) architectures. Yet, many optical platforms naturally generate Gaussian states--the common states of continuous-variable (CV) systems, making CV-based QNs an attractive route toward scalable, chip-integrated quantum computation and communication. To bridge the conceptual gap between well-studied DV entanglement percolation theories and their CV counterpart, we introduce a Gaussian-to-Gaussian entanglement distribution scheme that deterministically transports two-mode squeezed vacuum states across large CV networks. Analysis of the scheme's collective behavior using statistical-physics methods reveals a new form of entanglement percolation--negativity percolation theory (NegPT)--characterized by a bounded entanglement measure called the ratio negativity. We discover that NegPT exhibits a mixed-order phase transition, marked simultaneously by both an abrupt change in global entanglement and a long-range correlation between nodes. This distinctive behavior places CV-based QNs in a new universality class, fundamentally distinct from DV systems. Additionally, the abruptness of this transition introduces a critical vulnerability of CV-based QNs: conventional feedback mechanism becomes inherently unstable near the threshold, highlighting practical implications for stabilizing large-scale CV-based QNs. Our results not only unify statistical models for CV-based entanglement distribution but also uncover previously unexplored critical phenomena unique to CV systems, providing valuable insights and guidelines essential for developing robust, feedback-stabilized QNs.</p>

            <h2>Unidirectional perfect absorption induced by chiral coupling in spin-momentum locked waveguide magnonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Qian, Qi Hong, Zi-Yuan Wang, Wen-Xin Wu, Yihao Yang, C.-M. Hu, J. Q. You, Yi-Pu Wang</p>
            <p>Chiral coupling opens new avenues for controlling and exploiting light-matter interactions. We demonstrate that chiral coupling can be utilized to achieve unidirectional perfect absorption. In our experiments, chiral magnon-photon coupling is realized by coupling the magnon modes in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres with spin-momentum-locked waveguide modes supported by spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). These photon modes exhibit transverse spin, with the spin direction determined by the propagation direction. Due to the intrinsic spin properties of the magnon mode, it exclusively couples with microwaves traveling in one direction, effectively suppressing the reflection channel. Under the critical coupling condition, transmission is also eliminated, resulting in unidirectional perfect absorption. By incorporating additional YIG spheres, bidirectional and multi-frequency perfect absorption can be achieved. Our work introduces a novel platform for exploring and harnessing chiral light-matter interactions within spin-momentum locked devices, offering a paradigm for unidirectional signal processing and energy harvesting technologies.</p>

            <p>Large-scale quantum computers possess the capacity to effectively tackle practical problems that can be insurmountable for classical computers. The main challenge in building these quantum computers is to realize scalable modules for remote qubits and entanglement. By assembling small, specialized parts into a larger architecture, the modular approach mitigates complexity and uncertainty. Such a distributed architecture requires non-local quantum gate operations between remote qubits. An essential method for implementing such operations, known as quantum gate teleportation, requires only local operations, classical communication, and shared entanglement. Till today, the quantum gate teleportation using a photonic chip has remained elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate the quantum teleportation of an on-chip controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, assisted with the scalable silicon chip platform, high-fidelity local quantum logic gates, linear optical components, post-selected entanglement, and coincidence measurements from photonic qubits. First, we measure and characterize our teleported chip-scale CNOT gate with an average truth table fidelity of 93.1 +- 0.3%. Second, for different input polarization states, we obtain an average quantum state fidelity of 87.0 +- 2.2% with our teleported on-chip CNOT gate. Third, we use our non-local CNOT gate for remote entanglement creation of four Bell states, with an average quantum state fidelity of 86.2 +- 0.8%. Fourthly, we fully characterize our teleported on-chip CNOT gate with a quantum process fidelity 83.1 +- 2.0%, and an average non-local CNOT gate fidelity of 86.5 +- 2.2%. Our teleported photonic on-chip quantum logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits and chip-scale modules towards fault-tolerant and large-scale distributed quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Physics from Spin-Phonon Coupling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Zhang, Langxuan Chen, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$ symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit, as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Speed Limits Based on Schatten Norms: Universality and Tightness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto J. B. Rosal, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto, Diego Paiva Pires</p>
            <p>We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing general physical processes. These QSLs were obtained using Schatten $\alpha$-norms, firstly exploiting geometric features of the quantum state space, and secondly by applying the Holder's inequality for matrix norms. For single-qubit states, we find that the geometric QSL is independent of the chosen Schatten norm, thus revealing universality behavior. We compare these QSLs with existing speed limits in literature, showing that the latter results represent particular cases of a general class of QSLs related to Schatten $\alpha$-norms. We address necessary and sufficient conditions for the tightness of the QSLs that depends on populations and coherences of the qubits, also addressing their geometric meaning. We compare the QSLs obtained for qubit dynamics, also exploring their geometrical meaning. Finally, we show that the geometric QSL is tighter for general qubit dynamics with initial pure states, which indicates a universal QSL.</p>

            <p>Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the counterintuitive possibility of extracting entangled quantum states from a reference state of an auxiliary system (the "embezzler") via local quantum operations while hardly perturbing the latter. We uncover a deep connection between the operational task of embezzling entanglement and the mathematical classification of von Neumann algebras. Our result implies that relativistic quantum fields are universal embezzlers: Any entangled state of any dimension can be embezzled from them with arbitrary precision. This provides an operational characterization of the infinite amount of entanglement present in the vacuum state of relativistic quantum field theories.</p>

            <p>A striking feature of cavity quantum electrodynamics is the existence of atom-photon bound states, which typically form when the coupling between the atom and its environment are strong enough that after de-excitation the atom can ``grab'' an emitted photon and re-absorb it, resulting in a virtual cloud surrounding the atom. Here we will demonstrate the existence of bound states that instead form in the case of weak coupling. Specifically, we show that when a quantum emitter is weakly coupled to a structured reservoir exhibiting topologically-protected surface states, hybridizations between these states and the emitter can form, resulting in mid-gap bound states. We illustrate this using a semi-infinite extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as our reservoir. First, we diagonalize the bare semi-infinite SSH chain and reveal a winding number that predicts only the edge state on the finite side of the chain survives the semi-infinite extension. Then, after coupling the quantum emitter to this end of the chain, we analyze the modified emitter spectrum and reveal the existence of bound states in three parameter regions. Two of these represent the usual strong-coupling bound states, while the third gives the weak-coupling bound states with eigenvalue appearing in the SSH band gap and which exhibit partial sublattice localization. We demonstrate that oscillations between the weak-coupling bound states can be used to transfer the particle from the emitter into the lattice in a predictable and reversible manner.</p>

            <h2>Covariant path integrals for quantum fields back-reacting on classical space-time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Oppenheim, Zachary Weller-Davies</p>
            <p>We introduce configuration space path integrals for quantum fields interacting with classical fields. We show that this can be done consistently by proving that the dynamics are completely positive directly, without resorting to master equation methods. These path integrals allow one to readily impose space-time symmetries, including Lorentz invariance or diffeomorphism invariance. They generalize and combine the Feynman-Vernon path integral of open quantum systems and the stochastic path integral of classical stochastic dynamics while respecting symmetry principles. We introduce a path integral formulation of general relativity where the space-time metric is treated classically. The theory is a candidate for a fundamental theory that reconciles general relativity with quantum mechanics. The theory is manifestly covariant, and may be inequivalent to the theory derived using master-equation methods. We prove that entanglement cannot be created via the classical field, reinforcing proposals to test the quantum nature of gravity via entanglement generation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Theory of Optical Spin Texture in Chiral Tellurium Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pronoy Das, Sathwik Bharadwaj, Jungho Mun, Xueji Wang, Junsuk Rho, Zubin Jacob</p>
            <p>The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</p>

            <h2>Two-photon coupling via Josephson element II: Interaction renormalizations and cross-Kerr coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene V. Stolyarov, V. L. Andriichuk, Andrii M. Sokolov</p>
            <p>We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.</p>

            <p>We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb lattice (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the edge modes form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum space. We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of analogue Hawking radiation in cavities with moving boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto García Martín-Caro, Javier Olmedo, Jose M. Sánchez Velázquez</p>
            <p>In this work we explore the limitations and robustness of thermal radiation in dynamical Casimir systems serving as analogs for Hawking radiation. Through detailed numerical analysis, we characterize particle production spectra in cavities with moving boundaries under various configurations, including expanding, collapsing, and rigidly accelerating scenarios. We find that thermal signatures emerge in specific expanding cavity configurations but are highly dependent on frequency bands and acceleration parameters. In those configurations of the cavity where there is thermal production, we derive fitting expressions that quantify deviations from idealized thermal spectra through gray-body factors, revealing oscillatory behaviors tied to acceleration duration. Our results identify which experimental setups can reliably simulate gravitationally-induced phenomena and quantify how finite-size effects and transient dynamics modify the expected thermal distributions, providing a comprehensive framework for distinguishing genuine Hawking-like radiation from experimental artifacts.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation -- revisited</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul R. Berman, Peter W. Milonni</p>
            <p>Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation is studied theoretically using both source-field theory and a Schrodinger picture approach. Using source-field theory we obtain formal equations for the Poynting vector and energy density without making the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). The initial condition at t=0 is one in which the atom is in an excited state and the field in the vacuum state. The source-field expressions are evaluated within the the RWA and WWA and are found to satisfy Poynting's theorem. To explore the consequences of not making the RWA and WWA, the Poynting vector and energy density are calculated using perturbation theory. We use a Schrodinger picture approach and essentially reproduce and complement the results of Compagno, Passante, and Persico [J. Mod. Optics 37:8, 1377 (2007)] and those of Power and Thirunamachandran [Phys. Rev. A 45, 54 (1992)] obtained using a Heisenberg picture approach. The theory involves a sum over field mode frequencies and both finite cutoffs and convergence factors are used to carry out the sums. It is shown that the perturbation theory calculation leads to unphysical values for atomic state populations for all times when a sum over all field frequencies is taken, even if a convergence factor is used. It is also proved that the fields calculated using source-field theory always satisfy Poynting's theorem for ct not equal to R, where R is the distance from the atom.</p>

            <h2>Robust Surface-Induced Enhancement of Exciton Transport in Magic-Angle-Oriented Molecular Aggregates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siwei Wang, Liang-Yan Hsu, Hsing-Ta Chen</p>
            <p>Exciton transport in molecular aggregates with magic-angle orientation is expected to be strongly suppressed due to their negligible dipole-dipole interactions. However, recent reports show that light-matter interactions can significantly enhance exciton transport attributed to the effective long-range coupling mediated by the photonic fields. To elucidate their interplay, we employ the macroscopic quantum electrodynamics framework to simulate exciton transport within a chromophore array arranged in a magic-angle configuration in proximity to a silver surface. Our results show a significant enhancement of the exciton diffusion coefficient that is robust across variations in chromophore-surface separation, intermolecular distance, and molecular transition frequency. Furthermore, based on the image-dipole method, we derive analytical expressions that agree well with numerical simulations, revealing the enhancement's origin in the near-field coupling term as induced by the radiative scattering at the metallic surface. More importantly, we observe non-trivial differences in the diffusion coefficient's scaling near metallic surfaces compared to free space. Our findings highlight the potential to control exciton transport by designing coupled exciton-photon systems and engineering the dielectric environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuan Zhao, Yi Xu, Le-Man Kuang, Jie-Qiao Liao</p>
            <p>Fock-state lattices (FSLs) are becoming an emerging research hotspot in quantum physics, not only because the FSLs provide a new perspective for studying atom-field interactions, but also because they build the connection between quantum optics and condensed matter physics. Owing to the multiple transition paths in the lattices, inherent quantum interference effect exists in these systems, and hence how to find new quantum coherent phenomena and exploit their applications becomes a significant and desired task in this field. In this work, we study the dark-state effect in the FSLs generated by the multimode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) models. By considering the FSLs in certain-excitation-number subspaces, we study the dark states with respect to the states associated with the atomic excited state using the arrowhead-matrix method. We find that there exist dark-state subspaces with the dimensions determined by the number of orthogonal dark states. When the dimension is larger than one, the forms of these dark-state bases are not unique. Further, we obtain the number and form of the orthogonal dark states in the two-, three-, and four-mode JC models. In addition, we find that for a general $N$-mode JC model, there are $C_{N+n-2}^{N-2}$ orthogonal dark states in the $n$-excitation subspace. We also build the relationship between the dark modes and dark states. Our work will pave the way for exploring quantum optical effects and quantum information processing based on the FSLs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edison S. Carrera, Harold Erbin, Grégoire Misguich</p>
            <p>We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type Van der Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques we construct time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin squeezing and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, significantly outperforming conventional quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states, opening pathways to enhanced quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Strongly coupling two systems allows them to exchange coherent information before the systems decohere. This important regime in light-matter interactions has predominantly been reached in optical resonator configurations. In this work, we present the experimental realization of strong coupling between optical and acoustic fields within a continuum of modes in a cavity-less configuration after a single-pass through an optical waveguide. The underlying physical effect of anti-Stokes Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a highly nonlinear fiber at T = 4 K allows us to experimentally demonstrate strong coupling in a waveguide scenario. We show the splitting of the optoacoustic spectral response and introduce a novel technique to measure the avoided crossing of hybrid optoacoustic modes via forced detuning. This demonstration opens a path towards in-line acoustic-waves-based quantum signal processing in waveguide systems.</p>

            <p>Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on advancing healthcare technology.</p>

            <p>Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability, and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches, achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.</p>

            <h2>Unfolded distillation: very low-cost magic state preparation for biased-noise qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Ruiz, Jérémie Guillaud, Christophe Vuillot, Mazyar Mirrahimi</p>
            <p>Magic state distillation enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computation by implementing non-Clifford gates via the preparation of high-fidelity magic states. However, it comes at the cost of substantial logical-level overhead in both space and time. In this work, we propose a very low-cost magic state distillation scheme for biased-noise qubits. By leveraging the noise bias, our scheme enables the preparation of a magic state with a logical error rate of $3 \times 10^{-7}$, using only 53 qubits and 5.5 error correction rounds, under a noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 5 \times 10^6$ and a phase-flip noise rate of $0.1\%$. This reduces the circuit volume by more than one order of magnitude relative to magic state cultivation for unbiased-noise qubits and by more than two orders of magnitude relative to standard magic state distillation. Moreover, our scheme provides three key advantages over previous proposals for biased-noise qubits. First, it only requires nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a 2D lattice. Second, the logical fidelity remains nearly identical even at a more modest noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 80$, at the cost of a slightly increased circuit volume. Third, the scheme remains effective even at high physical phase-flip rates, in contrast to previously proposed approaches whose circuit volume grows exponentially with the error rate. Our construction is based on unfolding the $X$ stabilizer group of the Hadamard 3D quantum Reed-Muller code in 2D, enabling distillation at the physical level rather than the logical level, and is therefore referred to as $\textit{unfolded}$ distillation.</p>

            <h2>Spacetime duality between sequential and measurement-feedback circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsung-Cheng Lu, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Yizhi You</p>
            <p>Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Rojkov, Elias Zapusek, Florentin Reiter</p>
            <p>Dissipative quantum error correction (QEC) autonomously protects quantum information using engineered dissipation and offers a promising alternative to error correction via measurement and feedback. However, scalability remains a challenge, as correcting high-weight errors typically requires increasing dissipation rates and exponentially many correction operators. Here, we present a scalable dissipative QEC protocol for discrete-variable codes, correcting multi-qubit errors via a trickle-down mechanism that sequentially reduces errors weight. Our construction exploits redundancy in the Knill-Laflamme conditions to design correction operators that act on multiple error subspaces simultaneously, thereby reducing the overhead from exponential to polynomial in the number of required operators. We illustrate our approach with repetition codes under biased noise, showing a fourfold improvement in the exponential suppression factor at realistic physical error rates. Our approach connects autonomous QEC for discrete-variable codes with demonstrated dissipative protocols for bosonic codes and opens up new avenues for traditional measurement-feedback QEC and fault-tolerant quantum operations.</p>

Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum processor.

We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach through numerical simulations of two-qubit open systems.

            <p>A major challenge in the burgeoning field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the realization of scalable $2+1$D lattice gauge theories on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, which is an essential step towards the overarching goal of probing $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer. Despite great progress, current experimental implementations of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small system sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical matter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter fields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely spin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial dimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource overhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits for the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the first-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in the presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general method for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations $S>1/2$. Compared to conventional qubit encodings, our framework significantly reduces the number of quantum resources and gate count. Our approach significantly enhances scalability and fidelity for probing nonequilibrium phenomena in higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories, and is readily amenable to implementation on state-of-the-art qudit platforms.</p>

Currently, this is hampered by small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics, signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their qubit counterparts.</p>

            <p>Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most efficient process to synthesize graphene sheets using methane as precursor, making it a strategic alternative route for the Liquefied Natural Gas market. In this reaction, tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TAH) are produced as residual and intermediary molecules. Sorting a combinatorial space of variants of TAHs by energy is a poorly studied problem needed to optimize CVD, while it is also a candidate for quantum advantage in quantum computers. We extend on Sridhara's polynomial root formula to perform block-diagonalization (hence SBD) of six TAHs using Hartree-Fock Hamiltonians with STO-3G basis set and active orbital space growing from 2 to 6 orbitals, with equal numbers for the number of active electrons. We show that the proposed compression algorithm followed by Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) allows for sorting of the molecules by ground state energy, while speeding up the VQE simulation up to tenfold and reducing its error to the $10^{-1}$ scale. The compression capability of $(1-2^{-k})\cdot 100\%$ in matrix size for $k$ qubits allows VQEs to have a broader set of applications, providing a new and necessary tool to overcome the circuit size and quantum noise limitations of large quantum processing units.</p>

            <h2>Detecting Entanglement in High-Spin Quantum Systems via a Stacking Ensemble of Machine Learning Models</h2>

            <p>Reliable detection and quantification of quantum entanglement, particularly in high-spin or many-body systems, present significant computational challenges for traditional methods. This study examines the effectiveness of ensemble machine learning models as a reliable and scalable approach for estimating entanglement, measured by negativity, in quantum systems. We construct an ensemble regressor integrating Neural Networks (NNs), XGBoost (XGB), and Extra Trees (ET), trained on datasets of pure states and mixed Werner states for various spin dimensions. The ensemble model with stacking meta-learner demonstrates robust performance by CatBoost (CB), accurately predicting negativity across different dimensionalities and state types. Crucially, visual analysis of prediction scatter plots reveals that the ensemble model exhibits superior predictive consistency and lower deviation from true entanglement values compared to individual strong learners like NNs, even when aggregate metrics are comparable. This enhanced reliability, attributed to error cancellation and variance reduction inherent in ensembling, underscores the potential of this approach to bypass computational bottlenecks and provide a trustworthy tool for characterizing entanglement in high-dimensional quantum physics. An empirical formula for estimating data requirements based on system dimensionality and desired accuracy is also derived.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of Magic in the quantum Ising chain via Quantum Monte Carlo tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Timsina, Yi-Ming Ding, Emanuele Tirrito, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Bin-Bin Mao, Mario Collura, Zheng Yan, Marcello Dalmonte</p>
            <p>We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic Generation of Four-Component Schrödinger Cat States via Floquet Engineering in a Hybrid Magnon-Superconductor System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiwen He, Zi-Long Yang, Sitong Jin, Feng-Yang Zhang, Chong Li</p>
            <p>Four-component Schrödinger cat states, superpositions of four coherent states symmetrically arranged in phase space, offer rich nonclassical features and enhanced resilience to decoherence, making them promising resources for quantum information science. We propose a Floquet-engineered scheme to deterministically generate four-component Schrödinger cat states in a hybrid quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, a microwave cavity, and a magnon mode. By applying periodic transverse drives to the qubits, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that conditionally displaces the magnon mode depending on the joint qubit state. Conditional measurements in the $\sigma_x$ basis project the magnon mode into nonclassical four-component cat states with high fidelity. The Wigner functions in the original frame verified the non-classicality of the four-component Schrödinger cat states. Results of systematically analyzing the impacts of qubit decoherence, magnon loss, and cavity dissipation demonstrate the robustness to the dissipation. The results show that this scheme can realize the generation of multi-component quantum superposition states in a scalable solid-state platform, providing a new approach for hybrid quantum information processing based on nonclassical magnon this http URL.</p>

            <p>The classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation connects, via a series of unitary transformations, the dynamics of a quantum particle of mass $m$ located in a trap at position $\alpha(t)$, with the dynamics of a charge $e$ moving in an electric field $e{\cal{E}}(t)=-m\ddot{\alpha}(t)$ within the dipole approximation. In this paper, we extend the classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation to the quantum electrodynamic and quantum optical realm, by explicitly treating the trap location quantum mechanically, thus taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the time-dependent displacement force. Compared to the classical case, we show that quantum electrodynamic corrections appear, and we propose an optomechanical realization for the quantized position of the trap to show that such corrections can manifest in state-of-the-art experiments. These results open the path to novel quantum simulation of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics of attoscience and ultrafast physics by using ultracold trapped atoms and ions.</p>

            <h2>Dark-state photonic entanglement filters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>Preserving entanglement in the presence of decoherence remains a major challenge for quantum technologies. Recent proposals [M.A. Selim et al., Science 387, 1424 (2025)] have employed photonic filters based on anti-parity-time symmetry to recover certain entangled states, but these approaches require intricate, symmetry-constrained waveguide architectures and precise bath engineering. In this work, we show that such strict non-Hermitian symmetry constraints are not necessary for entanglement filtering. Instead, we identify post-selection and the emergence of dark states -- arising naturally through destructive interference in simple photonic settings -- as the essential mechanisms. By avoiding the need for special bath engineering or non-Hermitian symmetries, our approach significantly simplifies the design and architecture, enhances universality, and extends applicability beyond previously studied dimer configurations. We demonstrate this concept using minimal waveguide network designs, offering a broadly accessible route to robust entanglement filtering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. A. Saltykova, A. V. Yulin, I. A. Shelykh</p>
            <p>Cavity polaritons, the elementary excitations appearing in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime, reveal clear signatures of quantum collective behavior. The combination of unique spin structure and strong nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena. Spin relaxation processes are of crucial importance here. However, a mathematical formalism for their coherent description is still absent. In the present paper, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major role.</p>

Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field. Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.</p>

            <h2>Utility-Scale Quantum Computation of Ground-State Energy in a 100+ Site Planar Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Ahsan</p>
            <p>We present experimental quantum computation of the ground-state energy in a 103-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), with IBM's Heron r1 and Heron r2 quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our per-site ground-state energy estimate is $-0.417\,J$, which, under open-boundary corrections, matches the energy in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., $-0.4386\,J$. To achieve this, we used a hybrid approach that splits the conventional Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. More importantly, we introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining computational accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices on utility quantum processors.</p>

While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.</p>

Notably, this approach constitutes a natural extension of the quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) algorithm. This algorithm combines the advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishan Amgain, Mahir Rahman, Umar Arshad, Fernando Romero Consuegra, Emil Sayahi, Imran M. Mirza</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the generation and dynamics of tripartite entanglement among qubits (quantum emitters or atoms) in multimode cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Our cQED architecture features three initially unentangled excited two-level quantum emitters confined within a triangle-shaped multimode optical cavity, which later become entangled due to a Jaynes-Cummings-like interaction. Using the tripartite negativity measure of entanglement and fidelity with respect to the genuine tripartite entangled state (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (or GHZ) state, to be precise), we analyze the impact of the number of cavity modes, qubit locations, and losses (spontaneous emission from qubits and photon leakage from the cavity mirrors) on the generated entanglement. Our key results include the presence of two kinds of retardation effects: one resulting from the time it takes for photons to propagate from one qubit to another, and the other to complete one round trip in the cavity. We observed these retardation effects only in multimode cavities, with the exciting possibility of controlling the collapse and revival patterns of tripartite entanglement by altering the qubit locations in the cavity. Furthermore, the impact of losses on the generated entanglement and the dependence of maximum entanglement on the total number of modes yield results that surpass those reported for single and two excitations. With recent advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics, these findings hold promise for the development of entanglement-based quantum networking protocols and quantum memories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianmin Wang, Rong Zhu, Yue Li, Z. Y. Ou</p>
            <p>Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated, we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than 3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme, when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.</p>

            <p>The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</p>

            <p>Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units.

This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice.

Employing two copropagating pump beams with frequency difference matching twice the plasma frequency, we generate quantum-correlated photon pairs through phonon-mediated four-wave mixing. The process exhibits remarkable thermal noise tolerance, allowing strong squeezing even with large thermal phonon numbers. This plasma-based approach produces squeezed states with ultrahigh photon numbers, opening new possibilities for strong-field applications across optical to X-ray wavelengths.</p>

            <p>Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase and loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including transversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we introduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. As an application, we consider simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth for a single time step from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ while retaining a site count of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, implying a linear-in-$N$ end-to-end gate depth for simulating materials, as opposed to quadratic in previous approaches. We also introduce a fermion-inspired qubit algorithm with $O(\mathrm{log}(N)$ depth, but a prohibitive number of additional ancilla qubits. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple from the point of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that the process of chemical bond formation is accompanied by a marked increase in the quantum complexity of the electronic ground state. By studying the hydrogen dimer H$_{2}$ as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a pronounced peak that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This measure of quantum complexity, known as magic in the quantum information literature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using classical methods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or breaking are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This insight suggests a connection of quantum information measures to chemical reactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules as a quantum computational resource.</p>

            <p>Quantum magic, which accounts for the non-stabilizer content of a state, is essential for universal quantum computation beyond classically simulable resources. We investigate the generation and evolution of quantum magic in discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) using the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy as a measure of quantum magic. We investigate single- and two-walker quantum walks on a one-dimensional lattice, considering a wide range of initial coin states. Our results reveal that DTQWs can dynamically generate significant magic, with the amount and structure strongly dependent on the initial state of the coin. In the case of a single walker, the relationship between magic and entanglement is found to be nontrivial and complementary at long times. These findings position DTQWs as accessible and controllable platforms for producing quantum magic, offering a new perspective on their role in quantum information processing and reliable quantum computation.</p>

The resulting interactions, which may be van der Waals or dipolar, induce a phonon swap interaction between the two species, thereby coherently cooling the polar molecules without affecting the internal state, a process which can be repeated if the atoms are cooled again or new cold atoms are brought in.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sam Alterman, Peter J. Love</p>
            <p>In the light-front (LF) formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), physics is formulated from the perspective of a massless observer necessarily traveling at the speed of light. The LF formulation provides an alternative computational approach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a future application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum resources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the laboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D transverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy operator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from the instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF Hamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta in IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF momentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the IF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to prepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point, corresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are stabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while the IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF momentum-space. These results show that quantum resources such as entanglement and magic are utilized differently by quantum simulations formulated in LF and IF, and that the simplicity of the LF ground state results in fewer required quantum resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Pathak, Masaki Tezuka</p>
            <p>Understanding how quantum chaotic systems generate entanglement can provide insight into their microscopic chaotic dynamics and can help distinguish between different classes of chaotic behavior. Using von Neumann entanglement entropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$. All the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at late times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory (RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect, arising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary SYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that these differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants are quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of chaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a fine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect on thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point autocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but deviations from RMT predictions for $N \geq 24$, particularly near the crossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-jun Xu, Long-hua Zhai, Peng Fu, Shou-jing Cheng, Guo-Qiang Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a cavity magnonic system driven by a parametric field, where an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is placed in a spinning microwave resonator. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram due to both magnon Kerr nonlinearity in YIG and parametric drive on the resonator. Especially, Sagnac-Fizeau shift caused by the spinning of the resonator brings about a significant modification in the critical driving strengths for second- and first-order quantum phase transitions, which means that the highly controllable quantum phase can be realized by the spinning speed of the resonator. More importantly, based on the difference in the detunings of the counterclockwise and clockwise modes induced by spinning direction of the resonator, we show that the phase transition in this system is nonreciprocal, that is, the quantum phase transition occurs when the cavity is driven in one direction but not the other. Our work offers an alternative path to engineer and design nonreciprocal magnonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Ballini, Julius Mildenberger, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</p>

            <p>This experimental work demonstrates multipartite quantum correlation in bright frequency combs out of a microresonator integrated on silicon nitride operating above its oscillation threshold. Multipartite features, going beyond so far reported two-mode correlation, naturally arise due to a cascade of non-linear optical processes, making a single-color laser pump sufficient to initiate their generation. Our results show the transition from two-mode to multipartite correlation, witnessed by noise reductions as low as $-2.5$\,dB and $-2$\,dB, respectively, compared to corresponding classical levels. A constant of the movement of the non-linear interaction Hamiltonian is identified and used to asses the multipartite behavior. Reported demonstrations pave the way to next generation on-chip multipartite sources for quantum technologies applications.</p>

            <p>We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5 \times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$ $^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.</p>

            <p>We derive the analogues of the Dirac and Pauli equations from a spatially fourth-order Klein--Gordon equation with a universal length scale. Starting from a singularly perturbed variant of Maxwell's equations, we deduce a 32-dimensional variant of the Dirac equation for spin-$1/2$ particles through an algebraic factorization procedure. We illustrate an experimental test of the theory from the split lines of the electron beam in a Stern--Gerlach experiment. This hyperfine splitting leads to four distinct eigenvalues of the spin operator, which can be grouped into two pairs centered around the classic values of $\pm\hbar/2$.

            <p>We propose a quantum computation architecture based on geometries with nearest-neighbor interactions, including e.g. planar structures. We show how to efficiently split the role of qubits into data and entanglement-generation qubits. Multipartite entangled states, e.g. 2D cluster states, are generated among the latter, and flexibly transformed via mid-circuit measurements to multiple, long-ranged Bell states, which are used to perform several two-qubit gates in parallel on data qubits. We introduce planar architectures with $n$ data and $n$ auxiliary qubits that allow one to perform $O(\sqrt n)$ long-ranged two-qubit gates simultaneously, with only one round of nearest neighbor gates and one round of mid-circuit measurements. We also show that our approach is applicable in existing superconducting quantum computation architectures, with only a constant overhead.</p>

            <p>Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number -- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm. Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2 (ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture, highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.</p>

            <p>Proton transfer reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological systems, where quantum effects such as tunneling, delocalization, and zero-point motion play key kinetic control roles. However, classical methods capable of accurately capturing these phenomena scale prohibitively with system size. Here, we develop and demonstrate quantum computing algorithms based on the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital framework, treating the transferring proton quantum mechanically. We assess the potential of current quantum devices for simulating proton transfer kinetics with high accuracy. We first construct a deep initial ansätze within a truncated orbital space by employing the frozen natural orbital approximation. Then, to balance circuit depth against state fidelity, we implement an adaptive form of approximate quantum compiling. Using resulting circuits at varying compression levels transpiled for the ibm_fez device, we compute barrier heights and delocalised proton densities along the proton transfer pathway using a realistic hardware noise model. We find that, although current quantum hardware introduces significant noise relative to the demanding energy tolerances involved, our approach allows substantial circuit simplification while maintaining energy barrier estimates within 13% of the reference value. Despite present hardware limitations, these results offer a practical means of approximating key circuit segments in near-term devices and early fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdolreza Pasharavesh, Sai Sreesh Venuturumilli, Michal Bajcsy</p>
            <p>We investigate the operation of a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector consisting of a cascade of waveguide-coupled lambda-type emitters, where each waveguide-coupled emitter extracts a single photon from the input light and sends it to a single-photon detector. Using Green's function and input-output formalisms, we derive the scattering matrices and photon-photon correlators for individual scatterers. By cascading these results, we obtain a closed-form expression for the detector's precision in the linear regime and predict how correlations generated by nonlinear photon-photon interactions influence this precision. To evaluate the performance of this PNR detector in the nonlinear regime, we apply the quantum trajectory method to the cascaded setup, calculating the achievable precision and analyzing its dependence on key system parameters, such as the number of emitters and their coupling strength to the waveguide. We compare the performance of the proposed PNR detector with that of a conventional PNR scheme based on spatial demultiplexing via beamsplitters. Our results indicate that the proposed scheme can outperform conventional detectors under realistic conditions, making it a promising candidate for next-generation PNR detection.</p>

            <h2>Time crystals and nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions mediated by squeezed bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenghao Zhang, Qingtian Miao, G. S. Agarwal</p>
            <p>Nonequilibrium dissipative phase transition, arising from the competition of cooperative behavior and coherent field driving, discovered in the 1970s by Narducci et al. and Walls et al., has been found to exhibit time-crystal behavior when the driving field exceeds the cooperative decay rate. This was seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based on engineered environments.</p>

            <p>Temporal resolution is a critical figure of merit in quantum sensing. This study combines the distinguishable condition of quantum states with quantum speed limits to establish a lower bound on interrogation time. When the interrogation time falls below this bound, the output state becomes statistically indistinguishable from the input state, and the information will inevitably be lost in noise. Without loss of generality, we extend these conclusions to time-dependent signal Hamiltonian. In theory, leveraging certain quantum control techniques allows us to calculate the minimum interrogation time for arbitrary signal Hamiltonian. Finally, we illustrate the impact of quantum speed limits on magnetic field measurements and temporal resolution.</p>

Here, we show theoretically that spin squeezing, a form of quantum metrology based on entanglement, is a natural fit for improving the SNR in electron microscopy. We investigate the generation of the necessary entangled states through electron-electron Coulomb interactions and quantum non-demolition measurements. Our results connect the fields of quantum metrology and electron interferometry, paving the way toward electron microscopy with SNR beyond the shot-noise limit.</p>

            <h2>Order-preserving condition for coherence measures of projective measurements with One Example</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hai Wang</p>
            <p>Superposition is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. From the Schrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm, quantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and crucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of coherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource theories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly independent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will focus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal subspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such measures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert spaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of coherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence measure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other reasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure. As the partial order relationship exists for not only projective measurements, but also POVMs, it's natural to study the order-preserving condition in POVM cases, which will be the last part of this work.</p>

We estimate the inductance of the coupler independently by low-temperature resistance measurements providing $L_c = (0.74\pm0.14)\,\mathrm{nH}$, which is compatible with $g/\omega \gtrsim 0.1$. Our results show that superinductors are a promising tool to study USC physics in high-coherence circuits using flux qubits with small loop areas and low persistent currents.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum technology, playing a key role in quantum computing, cryptography, and information processing. Conventional methods for generating entanglement via optical setups rely on beam splitters, nonlinear media, or quantum dots, which often require bulky configurations and precise phase control. In contrast, metasurfaces - ultrathin, engineered optical interfaces - offer a compact and tunable alternative for quantum photonics. In this work, we demonstrate that metasurfaces can serve as a promising platform for generating Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven spin-entanglement mechanism. By analyzing the system's evolution under a metasurface interaction Hamiltonian, we show that an initially separable spin state evolves into a maximally entangled Bell state. We further study classical and quantum correlations, evaluate the impact of environmental decoherence, and compute quantum discord to quantify correlation robustness beyond entanglement. Our analysis shows that metasurfaces can generate Bell states with a concurrence of about 0.995 and maintain quantum discord for up to 29 microseconds. These results establish metasurfaces as scalable, high-fidelity components for next-generation quantum photonic architectures.</p>

By tuning the Barnett effect through the magnetic field direction, our system enables controllable asymmetric EPR steering and nonreciprocal entanglement between both directly and indirectly coupled modes. We demonstrate that adjusting the reflectivity of a beam splitter can boost stationary quantum steering and entanglement, effectively countering thermal noise. This approach allows for the generation of multipartite entanglement and both one-way and two-way steering.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Kun Yang</p>
            <p>Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a key computational strategy for identifying potential drug candidates by estimating the binding free energies (delta G_bind) of protein-ligand complexes. The immense size of chemical libraries, combined with the need to account for protein and ligand conformations as well as ligand translations and rotations, makes these tasks computationally intensive on classical hardware. This study proposes a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) framework to estimate delta G_bind efficiently. Using the PDBbind v2020 dataset, we trained QCNN models with 9 and 12 qubits, with the core set designated as the test set. The best-performing model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.694 on the test set. To assess robustness, we introduced quantum noise under two configurations. While noise increased the root mean square deviation, the Pearson correlation coefficient remained largely stable. These results demonstrate the feasibility and noise tolerance of QCNNs for high-throughput virtual screening and highlight the potential of quantum computing to accelerate drug discovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gal G. Shaviner, Ziv Chen, Steven H. Frankel</p>
            <p>This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an 21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$, enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$ observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems of equations, and they point to the need for the development of measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanfeng Wang, Kurt Jacobs, Donald Fahey, Yong Hu, Dirk R. Englund, Matthew E. Trusheim</p>
            <p>Phase transitions can dramatically alter system dynamics, unlocking new behavior and improving performance. Exceptional points (EPs), where the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a coupled linear system coalesce, are particularly relevant for sensing applications as they can increase sensor response to external perturbations to a range of phenomena from optical phase shifts to gravitational waves. However, the coalescence of eigenstates at linear EPs amplifies noise, negating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement. Here, we overcome this limitation using nonlinearity, which exhibits exceptional SNR around a bistable transition point (BP). We couple a state-of-the-art diamond quantum sensor to a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, forming a self-oscillating hybrid system that exhibits both a single-valued and bistable phase. The boundaries between these phases are marked by both adiabatic and deterministic non-adiabatic transitions that enable chiral state switching and state coalescence at the BP. Crucially, NV magnetometry performed near the BP exhibits a 17x enhancement in SNR, achieving a record sensitivity of 170 fT/\sqrt{Hz}. This result surpasses the sensitivity limit of an ideal, thermally-limited electron magnetometer and resolves a long-standing debate regarding EP-like physics in advanced quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated immense potential in synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity images. However, critical questions remain unanswered regarding how quantum principles might best enhance their representational and computational capacity. In this paper, we investigate hybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to systematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over a fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models, which incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator, consistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable quantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts. In particular, VQCs in the generator accelerate early feature learning, whereas those in the discriminator, despite exhibiting slower initial convergence, ultimately facilitate more refined synthetic outputs. Moreover, the model sustains near-comparable performance even when the dataset size is drastically reduced, suggesting that transfer learning and quantum enhancements mitigate the problem of data scarcity. Overall, the results underscore that carefully integrating quantum computing with classical adversarial training and pretrained feature extraction can considerably enrich GAN-based image synthesis. These insights open avenues for future work on higher-resolution tasks, alternative quantum circuit designs, and experimentation with emerging quantum hardware.</p>

We introduce a passive, interference-based methodology for suppressing radiative decay using only the intrinsic multi-mode structured environment of superconducting circuits. By taking into account the full electromagnetic mode-mode couplings within the device, we derive analytic conditions that enable destructive interference. These conditions are realized by introducing controlled geometric asymmetries -- such as localized perturbations to the transmon capacitor -- which increase mode hybridization and activate interference between multiple decay pathways. We validate this methodology using perturbation theory, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and experimental measurements of a symmetry-broken transmon qubit with improved coherence times.</p>

We show that the product of these two weak values corresponds to the normalized expectation value of a strong, state-conditioned observable $B = A P_\psi A$, where $P_\psi = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the projector onto the preselected state. Analyzing the structure of $B$, we demonstrate how it encodes interference information, particularly when $\ket{\psi}$ is a superposition rather than an eigenstate of $A$. This formulation extends naturally to mixed states by replacing $P_\psi$ with a generic density matrix $\rho$, linking the construction to the formalism of generalized quantum measurements. We illustrate practical applications in quantum information, including state-specific error witnessing in quantum computing, and show how the phase of a weak value can be inferred via strong measurements in the pure-state case.</p>

            <h2>Robust Entanglement Generation in Bipartite Quantum Systems Using Optimal Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nahid Binandeh Dehaghani, A. Pedro Aguiar, Rafal Wisniewski</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its efficient and high-fidelity generation remains a challenge due to the complexity of quantum dynamics. This paper presents a quantum optimal control framework to maximize bipartite entanglement within a fixed time horizon, under bounded control inputs. By leveraging Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, we derive a set of necessary conditions that guide the design of time-dependent control fields to steer a two-qubit system toward maximally entangled Bell states. The entanglement is quantified using concurrence, and the control objective is formulated as maximizing this measure at the terminal time. Our approach is validated through numerical simulations of Liouville-von Neumann dynamics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of switching-based control strategies in achieving robust entanglement, offering insights into practical implementations of quantum control for entanglement generation in quantum networks.</p>

            <p>We evaluated a multi-color two-photon entangled state generated in silicon via spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) as a potential source for bosonic integrated circuits. Spatially entangled photon states were created using a pair of silicon waveguides that produced signal and idler photons through SFWM, allowing us to observe quantum interference between them. Assuming that the frequencies of the multi-color photons were nearly identical, we characterized the generated quantum state by performing quantum state tomography on the bosonic system using a linear optical circuit. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using photon-pair sources generated in silicon via SFWM in bosonic optical circuits and highlights their potential for a wide range of applications in silicon-based optical quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>A microwave-optical transducer of sufficiently low noise and high signal transfer rate would allow entanglement to be distributed between superconducting quantum processors at a rate faster than the lifetimes of the quantum memories being linked. Here we present measurements of a membrane-based opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a quantum network with reasonable averaging times.</p>

            <p>Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice. Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.</p>

            <p>The ontological status of the quantum wavefunction remains one of the most debated questions in quantum theory. While epistemic interpretations regard the wavefunction as a reflection of our knowledge or beliefs, ontic interpretations treat it as a real physical object. In this paper, we argue that epistemic approaches struggle to explain the universality and precision of the uncertainty principle, a core feature of quantum mechanics. By contrast, treating the wave-function as ontic allows a consistent and natural derivation of quantum uncertainty from the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. We examine key interpretations on both sides and highlight why the epistemic view falls short in addressing constraints that appear to be intrinsic to nature.</p>

            <p>Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.</p>

            <p>Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context. The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.</p>

            <p>As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this paper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research community. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the specialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we expanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader community of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists' views and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While quantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate a persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring support likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen interpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical questions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave). Our findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational preferences over the past decades.</p>

            <p>In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for indiscernibility of quantum states, arguing that, given a set of observables, the ``distinguishable objects'' are the equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to the observables. The structure of the set of distinguishable objects - called the Holevo space - is investigated in detail, and it is shown that the observables admit a natural lift to continuous functions on the Holevo space. The theory is illustrated by several examples where the ``distinguishable objects'' can be described explicitly. Among other things, the Holevo spaces and the lifted functions are described for position measurements on a free particle and for spin measurements in the EPR and Bell experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxuan Tao, Fen Zuo</p>
            <p>The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.</p>

This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in systems with vanishing energy-level spacings.

The architecture combines a convolutional neural network for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical: only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning, while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability. Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models.

            <p>Quantum digital signatures ensure unforgeable message authenticity and integrity using quantum principles, offering unconditional security against both classical and quantum attacks. They are crucial for secure communication in high-stakes environments, ensuring trust and long-term protection in the quantum era. Nowadays, the majority of arbitrated quantum signature (AQS) protocols encrypt data qubit by qubit using the quantum one-time pad (QOTP). Despite providing robust data encryption, QOTP is not a good fit for AQS because of its susceptibility to many types of attacks. In this work, we present an efficient AQS protocol to encrypt quantum message ensembles using a distinct encryption technique, the chained controlled unitary operations. In contrast to existing protocols, our approach successfully prevents disavowal and forgery attacks. We hope this contributes to advancing future investigations into the development of AQS protocols.</p>

            <p>A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular, the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling. While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique, highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate formulas.</p>

            <h2>From Linear Differential Equations to Unitaries: A Moment-Matching Dilation Framework with Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiantao Li</p>
            <p>Quantum speed-ups for dynamical simulation usually demand unitary time-evolution, whereas the large ODE/PDE systems encountered in realistic physical models are generically non-unitary. We present a universal moment-fulfilling dilation that embeds any linear, non-Hermitian flow $\dot x = A x$ with $A=-iH+K$ into a strictly unitary evolution on an enlarged Hilbert space: \[ ( (l| \otimes I ) \mathcal T e^{-i \int ( I_A\otimes H +i F\otimes K) dt} ( |r) \otimes I ) = \mathcal T e^{\int A dt}, \] provided the triple $( F, (l|, |r) )$ satisfies the compact moment identities $(l| F^{k}|r) =1$ for all $k\ge 0$ in the ancilla space. This algebraic criterion recovers both \emph{Schrödingerization} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 230602 (2024)] and the linear-combination-of-Hamiltonians (LCHS) scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603 (2023)], while also unveiling whole families of new dilations built from differential, integral, pseudo-differential, and difference generators. Each family comes with a continuous tuning parameter \emph{and} is closed under similarity transformations that leave the moments invariant, giving rise to an overwhelming landscape of design space that allows quantum dilations to be co-optimized for specific applications, algorithms, and hardware. As concrete demonstrations, we prove that a simple finite-difference dilation in a finite interval attains near-optimal oracle complexity. Numerical experiments on Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation confirm the accuracy and robustness of the approach.</p>

This allows us to generalize the Stochastic Reconfiguration method for the simultaneous optimization of multiple variational wave functions, and to introduce the multidimensional versions of operator variances and overlaps.

            <p>Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</p>

            <p>We present a method to suppress crosstalk from implementing controlled-Z gates via local addressing in neutral atom quantum computers. In these systems, a fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates typically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup of two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive a spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the amplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of magnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters. To further reduce the infidelity, we develop a circuit to cancel remaining phase errors. Our results pave the way for using local addressing for high-fidelity quantum gates on Rydberg-based quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Current count-rate models for single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) typically assume an instantaneous recovery of the quantum efficiency following dead-time, leading to a systematic overestimation of the effective detection efficiency for high photon flux. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a generalized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the non-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following dead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson processes, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the exponential-recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately predicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming the conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the impinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the model to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model simplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum efficiency $\eta_0$, dead-time $\tau_\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be achieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally gated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key distribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and related areas. Furthermore, the model is readily adaptable to other types of dead-time-limited detectors. A Python implementation is provided as supplementary material for swift adoption.</p>

            <p>Classical Shadow Tomography (Huang, Kueng and Preskill, Nature Physics 2020) is a method for creating a classical snapshot of an unknown quantum state, which can later be used to predict the value of an a-priori unknown observable on that state. In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows received a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum computing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a major effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of generating the classical snapshot. Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central building block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as possible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions over \emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we create the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently prepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This state-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably weaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical shadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for \emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use \emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge, \emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the literature prior to our work. Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\ the part that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell basis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.</p>

            <p>In this work we present a comprehensive method of characterization and optimization of laser irradiation within a confocal microscope tailored to quantum sensing experiments using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. While confocal microscopy is well-suited for such experiments, precise control and understanding of several optical parameters are essential for reliable single-emitter studies. We investigate the laser beam intensity profile, single-photon emission statistics, fluorescence response under varying polarization and saturation conditions, spectral characteristics, and the temporal profiles of readout and reinitialization pulses. The beam quality is assessed using the beam propagation factor $M^2$, determined via the razorblade technique. Optical fluorescence spectrum is recorded to confirm NV centre emission. To confirm single-emitter operation, we measure second-order autocorrelation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. Saturation behaviour is analysed by varying laser power and recording the corresponding fluorescence, while polarization dependence is studied using a half-wave ($\lambda/2$) plate. Temporal laser pulse profile is examined by modulating the power of an acousto-optic modulator. After optimizing all relevant parameters, we demonstrate the microscope's capabilities in driving spin transitions of a single NV centre. This work establishes a straightforward and effective protocol for laser excitation optimization, enhancing the performance and reliability of NV-based quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Quantum Sensing with a Frustrated Kitaev Trimer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Huerta Alderete, Anubhav Kumar Srivastava, Andrew T. Sornborger</p>
            <p>We investigate the response of a Ramsey interferometric quantum sensor based on a frustrated, three-spin system (a Kitaev trimer) to a classical time-dependent field (signal). The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a critical point, $|\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying approximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear dependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial states, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that below a threshold, $|\vec{b}| < b_\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to the signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the signal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately omnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor configuration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such detectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a noise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum bubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and long-baseline telescopy.</p>

            <p>This work provides a rigorous and self-contained introduction to numerical methods for Hamiltonian simulation in quantum computing, with a focus on high-order product formulas for efficiently approximating the time evolution of quantum systems. Aimed at students and researchers seeking a clear mathematical treatment, the study begins with the foundational principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computation before presenting the Lie-Trotter product formula and its higher-order generalizations. In particular, Suzuki's recursive method is explored to achieve improved error scaling. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, the advantages and limitations of these techniques are discussed, with an emphasis on their application to $k$-local Hamiltonians and their role in overcoming classical computational bottlenecks. The work concludes with a brief overview of current advances and open challenges in Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

            <h2>Wave packets in QFT: leading order width corrections to decay rates and clock behaviour under Lorentz boosts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ariel Edery</p>
            <p>Decay rates in quantum field theory (QFT) are typically calculated assuming the particles are represented by momentum eigenstates (i.e. plane waves). However, strictly speaking, localized free particles should be represented by wave packets. This yields width corrections to the decay rate and to the clock behaviour under Lorentz boosts. We calculate the decay rate of a particle of mass $M$ modeled as a Gaussian wavepacket of width $a$ and centered at zero momentum. We find the decay rate to be $\Gamma_0 \big[1- \frac{3 a^2}{4 M^2} +\mathcal{O}\big(\tfrac{a^4}{M^4}\big)\big]$ where $\Gamma_0$ is the decay rate of the particle at rest treated as a plane wave. The leading correction is then of order $\tfrac{a^2}{M^2}$. We then perform a Lorentz boost of velocity $v$ on the above Gaussian and find that its decay rate does not decrease \textit{exactly} by the Lorentz factor $\sqrt{1-v^2}$. There is a correction of order $\tfrac{a^2v^2}{M^2}$. Therefore, the decaying wave packet does not act exactly like a typical clock under Lorentz boosts and we refer to it is a "WP clock" (wave packet clock). A WP clock does not move with a single velocity relative to an observer but has a spread in velocities (more specifically, a spread in momenta). Nonetheless, it is best viewed as a single clock as the wave packet represents a one-particle state in QFT. WP clocks do not violate Lorentz symmetry and are not based on new physics: they are a consequence of the combined requirements of special relativity, quantum mechanics and \textit{localized} free particles.</p>

            <h2>Two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ariel Edery</p>
            <p>It is known that perturbative expansions in powers of the coupling in quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) are asymptotic series. This can be useful at weak coupling but fails at strong coupling. In this work, we present two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling. We apply the series to a basic integral as well as a QM path integral containing a quadratic and quartic term with coupling constant $\lambda$. The first series is the usual asymptotic one, where the quartic interaction is expanded in powers of $\lambda$. The second series is an expansion of the quadratic part where the interaction is left alone. This yields an absolutely convergent series in inverse powers of $\lambda$ valid at strong coupling. For the basic integral, we revisit the first series and identify what makes it diverge even though the original integral is finite. We fix the problem and obtain, remarkably, a series in powers of the coupling which is absolutely convergent and valid at strong coupling. We explain how this series avoids Dyson's argument on convergence. We then consider the QM path integral (discretized with time interval divided into $N$ equal segments). As before, the second series is absolutely convergent and we obtain analytical expressions in inverse powers of $\lambda$ for the $n$th order terms by taking functional derivatives of generalized hypergeometric functions. The expressions are functions of $N$ and we work them out explicitly up to third order. The general procedure has been implemented in a Mathematica program that generates the expressions at any order $n$. We present numerical results at strong coupling for different values of $N$ starting at $N=2$. The series matches the exact numerical value for a given $N$ (up to a certain accuracy). The continuum is formally reached when $N\to \infty$ but in practice this can be reached at small $N$.</p>

            <h2>Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert</p>
            <p>Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.</p>

            <p>The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</p>

            <p>Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations. This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</p>

            <p>We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly correlated regime.</p>

            <h2>Lyapunov formulation of band theory for disordered non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konghao Sun, Haiping Hu</p>
            <p>Non-Bloch band theory serves as a cornerstone for understanding intriguing non-Hermitian phenomena, such as the skin effect and extreme spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions. Yet this theory hinges on translational symmetry and thus breaks down in disordered systems. Here, we develop a real-space Lyapunov formulation of band theory that governs the spectra and eigenstates of disordered non-Hermitian systems. This framework yields universal non-Hermitian Thouless relations linking spectral density and localization to Lyapunov exponents under different boundary conditions. We further identify an exact topological criterion: skin modes and Anderson-localized modes correspond to nonzero and zero winding numbers, respectively, revealing the topological nature of the skin-Anderson transition. This transition is dictated by an essential Lyapunov exponent and gives rise to novel unidirectional critical states. Our formulation provides a unified and exact description of spectra and localization in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems without translational symmetry, offering new insights into the interplay among non-Hermiticity, disorder, and topology.</p>

            <p>The gas-phase hydrogen exchange reaction (HER) is the most fundamental chemical process for benchmarking quantum reaction dynamics. In this Letter, we focus on controlling HER by means of strong light-matter coupling inside a resonant cavity, an approach often called polariton chemistry. In particular, we focus on the isotopic variation of HER involving collisions between molecular hydrogen H$_2$ and deuterium atom D, i.e., H$_2$+D$\to$HD+H. We find that the asymmetry introduced by the different isotopes, despite being small, enables strong cavity-induced modifications of reaction rates. Outside of the cavity the reaction is as usual D+H${_2}$$\to$DH+H. However, inside the cavity another type of reactions take place where D+H$_2$$\to$DH+H+E$_{photon}$, where E$_{photon}$=$\hbar\omega_{cav}$. Our results show that HER is an ideal platform to make a significant step toward closing the gap between theory and experiment in polariton chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1D XXZ Spin Chain</h2>

            <p>The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest. Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.</p>

In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.</p>

            <p>Based on the general thermodynamic analysis of Polanyi adsorption potential, the adsorption potential condition for superconductors is obtained exactly by using the quantum state equation we presented. Because this adsorption potential results in changes of electron concentration, temperature and pressure in a certain volume (adsorption space) adjacent to the surface of the lattice, the composition and structure of superconductors are of course decisive for the adsorption potential. Then we calculate the molar adsorption potentials for those typical superconductors, and find that it is positively correlated to the superconductivity temperature , which reveals that those high-superconductors are mainly determined by the higher molar adsorption potentials. In addition, the adsorption potential at still works despite the disappearance of the energy gap of the BCS theory. This shows that beyond the electron-phonon interaction mechanism, the Cooper-paired electrons are mainly formed by this physical adsorption potential for high-superconductors. This adsorption potential theory could explain almost all common facts about high-temperature superconductors, including many anomalies of the normal and superconducting states.</p>

            <p>Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged diamond nitrogen-vacancy ($\mathrm{{NV}^-}$) center plays a central role in many cutting edge quantum sensing applications; despite this, much is still unknown about the energy levels in this system. The ionization energy of the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ singlet state in the $\mathrm{{NV}^-}$ has only recently been measured at between 2.25 eV and 2.33 eV. In this work, we further refine this energy by measuring the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ energy as a function of laser wavelength and diamond temperature via magnetically mediated spin-selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching; this PL quenching indicating at what wavelength ionization induces population transfer from the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ into the neutral $\mathrm{{NV}^0}$ charge configuration. Measurements are performed for excitation wavelengths between 450 nm and 470 nm and between 540 nm and 566 nm in increments of 2 nm, and for temperatures ranging from about 50 K to 150 K in 5 K increments. We determine the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ ionization energy to be between 2.29 and 2.33 eV, which provides about a two-fold reduction in uncertainty of this quantity. Distribution level: A.

In this letter, we propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering, while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.</p>

            <p>For chaotic scattering systems we investigate the left-right Husimi representation, which combines left and right resonance states. We demonstrate that the left-right Husimi representation is invariant in the semiclassical limit under the corresponding closed classical dynamics, which we call quantum invariance. Furthermore, we show that it factorizes into a classical multifractal structure times universal quantum fluctuations. Numerical results for a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and quantum maps confirm both the quantum invariance and the factorization.</p>

            <p>Relativistic quantum mechanics can be considered to have begun with a search for wave equations corresponding to each intrinsic spin. However, relativistic quantum physics differs fundamentally from the non-relativistic wave mechanics. It requires a formalism allowing \ creation and destruction of particles. This gets proper treatment only in a framework called quantum field theory. This article is a semi-historic account of the intriguing new features which emerge as a part of quantum field theory. Such a discussion is impossible without a basic presentation of the formalism itself. Hence some mathematics is included in finer print. The article is directed mostly to those familiar with essential classical mechanics and basic quantum mechanics, though I strive to provide a flavour of the subject to the keenly interested non-physics reader.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.</p>

            <h2>Towards the ultimate limits of quantum channel discrimination and quantum communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Fang, Gilad Gour, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Distinguishability is fundamental to information theory and extends naturally to quantum systems. While quantum state discrimination is well understood, quantum channel discrimination remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of channels and the variety of discrimination strategies. This work advances the understanding of quantum channel discrimination and its fundamental limits. We develop new tools for quantum divergences, including sharper bounds on the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy and additivity results for channel divergences. We establish a quantum Stein's lemma for memoryless channel discrimination, and link the strong converse property to the asymptotic equipartition property and continuity of divergences. Notably, we prove the equivalence of exponentially strong converse properties under coherent and sequential strategies. We further explore the interplay among operational regimes, discrimination strategies, and channel divergences, deriving exponents in various settings and contributing to a unified framework for channel discrimination. Finally, we recast quantum communication tasks as discrimination problems, uncovering deep connections between channel capacities, channel discrimination, and the mathematical structure of channel divergences. These results bridge two core areas of quantum information theory and offer new insights for future exploration.</p>

            <p>Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are non-convex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present Quantum Control via Polynomial Optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iris Paparelle, Faezeh Mousavi, Francesco Scazza, Angelo Bassi, Matteo Paris, Alessandro Zavatta</p>
            <p>Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is a rapidly developing quantum communication approach, where secure information is directly transmitted, providing an alternative to key-based (de)encryption processes via Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). During the last decade, optical QSDC protocols based on discrete variable encodings have been successfully realized. Recently, continuous-variable (CV) QSDC schemes have been proposed, benefiting from less-sophisticated implementations with proven security. Here, we report the first table-top experimental demonstration of a CV-QSDC system and assess its security. For this realization, we analyze the security of different configurations, including coherent and squeezed sources, with Wyner wiretap channel theory in presence of a beam splitter attack. This practical protocol not only demonstrates the principle of QSDC systems based on CV encoding, but also showcases the advantage of squeezed states over coherent ones in attaining enhanced security and reliable communication in lossy and noisy channels. Our realization, which is founded on mature telecom components, paves the way into future threat-less quantum metropolitan networks, compatible with coexisting advanced wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong Li, Yi-Cheng Wang, Li-Wei Duan, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>The $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum Rabi model (QRM) with imaginary coupling is solved using the Bogoliubov operators approach. A transcendental function responsible for the exact solutions is derived, with its zeros yielding the regular spectrum. We find two types of intersections: One is the exceptional point (EP), which is widely studied in the non-Hermitian system; another one is due to doubly degenerate states caused by the conserved QRM parity, which is well-known in the Hermitian QRM. These intersections are identified through this transcendental function. EPs emerge between pairs of adjacent excited energy levels, shifting toward lower coupling strengths as energy levels increase. The fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity at the EPs, consistent with recent findings in non-Hermitian systems, while it diverges to positive infinity at the doubly degenerate points. The EPs are further confirmed by the vanishing c-product in the biorthogonal basis. All eigenstates are characterized by conserved energy and QRM parity. We conclude that the non-Hermitian QRM is integrable, analogous to its Hermitian counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Rate Function Modelling of Quantum Many-Body Adiabaticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vibhu Mishra, Salvatore Manmana, Stefan Kehrein</p>
            <p>The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.</p>

We derive the local GKSL equation on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides an upper bound of the propagation of information in quantum many-body systems. We numerically test the validity of the derived local GKSL equation for a one-dimensional tight-binding fermion chain.</p>

            <p>A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. While current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N$_2$ and the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wavefunctions. Our results suggest that, for current error rates, a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture can tackle challenging chemistry problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the efficacy of Stochastic Hill Climbing with Random Restarts (SHC-RR) compared to Local Search (LS) strategies within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework across various problem models. Employing uniform parameter settings, including the number of restarts and SHC steps, we analyze LS with two distinct perturbation operations: multiplication and summation. Our comparative analysis encompasses multiple versions of max-cut and random Ising model (RI) problems, utilizing QAOA models with depths ranging from $1L$ to $3L$. These models incorporate diverse mixing operator configurations, which integrate $RX$ and $RY$ gates, and explore the effects of an entanglement stage within the mixing operator. Our results consistently show that SHC-RR outperforms LS approaches, showcasing superior efficacy despite its ostensibly simpler optimization mechanism. Furthermore, we observe that the inclusion of entanglement stages within mixing operators significantly impacts model performance, either enhancing or diminishing results depending on the specific problem context.</p>

            <h2>Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita, M.S. Kim</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on Rényi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha>1$, while is a constant for $\alpha<1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha<1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha>1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with physical learning applications in physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>Accurately estimating the properties of quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum computing and quantum information. We propose a method to obtain unbiased estimators of multiple observables with low statistical error by post-processing informationally complete measurements using tensor networks. Compared to other observable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement frames, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimised to provide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to achieve a specified estimation precision; (ii) it scales to a large number of qubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any measurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient tensor-network representation. We benchmark the method through various numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems, and show that our method can provide statistical error that are orders of magnitude lower than the ones given by classical shadows.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Ji, Hemant K. Mishra, Milán Mosonyi, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a parallel strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nakshatra Gangopadhay, Sayan Choudhury</p>
            <p>Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</p>

            <p>The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on statistical inference. For a broad class of protocols, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, customarily addressed using a hypergeometric tail bound due to Serfling. Here, we provide an alternative solution for this task of unprecedented tightness among QKD security analyses. As a by-product, confidence intervals for the average of nonidentical Bernoulli parameters follow too. These naturally fit in statistical analyses of decoy-state QKD and also outperform standard tools. Last, we show that, in a vast parameter regime, the use of tail bounds is not enforced because the cumulative mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is accurately computable. This sharply decreases the minimum block sizes necessary for QKD, and reveals the tightness of our analytical bounds when moderate-to-large blocks are considered.</p>

Our method also presents an alternative computational tool for extracting the exact entanglement depth and all separable partitions of a stabilizer state. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Urbanowski</p>
            <p>Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schrödinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero, and which differ from those described in the literature. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.</p>

            <p>We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nouhaila Innan, Alberto Marchisio, Mohamed Bennai, Muhammad Shafique</p>
            <p>Predicting loan eligibility with high accuracy remains a significant challenge in the finance sector. Accurate predictions enable financial institutions to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and effectively adapt services to meet customer needs. However, the complexity and the high-dimensional nature of financial data have always posed significant challenges to achieving this level of precision. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel approach that employs Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Loan Eligibility Prediction using Quantum Neural Networks (LEP-QNN). Our innovative approach achieves an accuracy of 98% in predicting loan eligibility from a single, comprehensive dataset. This performance boost is attributed to the strategic implementation of a dropout mechanism within the quantum circuit, aimed at minimizing overfitting and thereby improving the model's predictive reliability. In addition, our exploration of various optimizers leads to identifying the most efficient setup for our LEP-QNN framework, optimizing its performance. We also rigorously evaluate the resilience of LEP-QNN under different quantum noise scenarios, ensuring its robustness and dependability for quantum computing environments. This research showcases the potential of QML in financial predictions and establishes a foundational guide for advancing QML technologies, marking a step towards developing advanced, quantum-driven financial decision-making tools.</p>

            <h2>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaoling Yang, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</p>

            <p>We investigate nonreciprocal scattering within the modes of a microwave frequency comb. Adjusting the pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of a Josephson parametric oscillator, we control constructive interference for the $m \longrightarrow \ell$ scattering processes, while concurrently achieving destructive interference for the inverse process $\ell \longrightarrow m$. We outline the methodology for realizing nonreciprocity in the context of two-mode isolation and a three-mode circulation, which we extend to multiple modes. We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model. Nonreciprocal scattering expands the toolset for parametric control, with the potential to engineer alternative quantum correlations.</p>

            <h2>Module-conditioned distribution of quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunho Cha, Jungwoo Lee</p>
            <p>As quantum computers require highly specialized and stable environments to operate, expanding their capabilities within a single system presents significant technical challenges. By interconnecting multiple quantum processors, distributed quantum computing can facilitate the execution of more complex and larger-scale quantum algorithms. End-to-end heuristics for the distribution of quantum circuits have been developed so far. In this work, we derive an exact integer programming approach for the Distributed Quantum Circuit (DQC) problem, assuming fixed module allocations. Since every DQC algorithm necessarily yields a module allocation function, our formulation can be integrated with it as a post-processing step. This improves on the hypergraph partitioning formulation, which finds a module allocation function and an efficient distribution at once. We also show that a suboptimal heuristic to find good allocations can outperform previous methods. In particular, for quantum Fourier transform circuits, we conjecture from experiments that the optimal module allocation is the trivial one found by this method.</p>

            <h2>Excessive precision compromises accuracy even with unlimited resources due to the trade-off in quantum metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong-Gang Song, Qing-yu Cai</p>
            <p>Precision and accuracy, as two crucial criteria for quantum metrology, have previously lacked rigorous definitions and distinctions. In this paper, we provide a unified definition of precision and accuracy from the perspective of distinguishing neighboring quantum states. Using the quantum Cramér-Rao bound as a lower bound for precision, we find that the corresponding accuracy will fall short of expectations, because the bias of the parameter estimation cannot be ignored. Given that probability estimation is unbiased, defining precision from the perspective of probability distributions provides a more comprehensive approach. This leads to a correction of the traditional precision lower bound by a factor of 2. The trade-off between precision and accuracy shows that precision can be further improved by sacrificing accuracy, while it should be restricted by inherent precision limit. The inherent precision limit, determined by the number of sampling, can reach the Heisenberg scaling even without entanglement resources, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly reduced accuracy. We show that accuracy may actually decrease with increasing sampling when one pursues excessive precision, which indicates the trade-off should be considered even with unlimited resources.</p>

            <h2>Dirac's variational approach to semiclassical Kramers problem in Smoluchowski limit</h2>

            <p>Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential. Quantum correction is incorporated in the drift potential, and is determined by quasi-stationary conditions and minimal uncertainty relation. The semiclassical rate obtained here is consistent in form with those from the quantum Smoluchowski equations deduced heuristically by modifying the diffusion coefficient using the path-integral method. Unlike approaches using the path-integral, which involves continuation into imaginary time, the approach here is simpler and more easily understood in terms of classical picture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurang Agrawal, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>We explore the performance of the metrology scheme by employing a quantum time flip during encoding, a specific case of processes with indefinite time direction, which we refer to as indefinite time directed metrology (ITDM). In the case of single parameter estimation of a unitary, we demonstrate that our protocol can achieve Heisenberg scaling (1/N) with product probe states, surpassing the standard quantum limit (1/\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of particles in the probe. We establish this by computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a lower bound on the root mean square error occurred during parameter estimation. Although we analytically prove the optimality of the symmetric product probe state in ITDM, entangled probe states produce a higher QFI than optimal product probes without enhancing scaling, highlighting the non-essentiality of entanglement. For phase estimation, we propose a single-qubit measurement on the control qubit that accomplishes near-optimal Fisher information and eventually reaches Heisenberg scaling. Our findings reveal the best orientation of product probe states in every pertinent situation, emphasizing its independence from the parameter to be estimated in the limiting case. Furthermore, we illustrate the benefits of ITDM in noisy metrology, outperforming existing techniques in some situations.</p>

            <h2>Fidelity Aware Multipath Routing for Multipartite State Distribution in Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evan Sutcliffe, Alejandra Beghelli</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of distributing entangled multipartite states across a quantum network with improved distribution rate and fidelity. For this, we propose fidelity-aware multi-path routing protocols, assess their performance in terms of the rate and fidelity of the distributed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and compare such performance against that of single-path routing. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-path routing protocols select routes that require more Bell states compared to single-path routing, but also require fewer rounds of Bell state generation. We also optimised the trade-off between distribution rate and fidelity by selecting an appropriate cutoff to the quantum memory storage time. Using such a cutoff technique, the proposed multi-path protocols can achieve up to an 8.3 times higher distribution rate and up to a 28% improvement in GHZ state fidelity compared to single-path routing. These results show that multi-path routing both improves the distribution rates and enhances fidelity for multipartite state distribution.</p>

            <p>The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Murauer, Rajiv Krishnakumar, Sabine Tornow, Michaela Geierhos</p>
            <p>Existing approaches to quantum reservoir computing can be broadly categorized into restart-based and continuous protocols. Restart-based methods require reinitializing the quantum circuit for each time step, while continuous protocols use mid-circuit measurements to enable uninterrupted information processing. A gap exists between these two paradigms: while restart-based methods naturally have high execution times due to the need for circuit reinitialization, they can employ novel feedback connections to enhance performance. In contrast, continuous methods have significantly faster execution times but typically lack such feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme that integrates feedback connections, which can operate within the coherence time of a qubit. We demonstrate our architecture using a minimal example and evaluate memory capacity and predictive capabilities. We show that the correlation coefficient for the short-term memory task on past inputs is nonzero, indicating that feedback connections can effectively operate during continuous processing to allow the model to remember past inputs.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.</p>

            <h2>Survival of the Optimized: An Evolutionary Approach to T-depth Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Archisman Ghosh, Avimita Chatterjee, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
            <p>Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is the cornerstone of practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC), but incurs enormous resource overheads. Circuits must decompose into Clifford+T gates, and the non-transversal T gates demand costly magic-state distillation. As circuit complexity grows, sequential T-gate layers ("T-depth") increase, amplifying the spatiotemporal overhead of QEC. Optimizing T-depth is NP-hard, and existing greedy or brute-force strategies are either inefficient or computationally prohibitive. We frame T-depth reduction as a search optimization problem and present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework that approximates optimal layer-merge patterns across the non-convex search space. We introduce a mathematical formulation of the circuit expansion for systematic layer reordering and a greedy initial merge-pair selection, accelerating the convergence and enhancing the solution quality. In our benchmark with ~90-100 qubits, our method reduces T-depth by 79.23% and overall T-count by 41.86%. Compared to the reversible circuit benchmarks, we achieve a 2.58x improvement in T-depth over the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its viability for near-term FTQC.</p>

            <h2>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Giovannini</p>
            <p>Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</p>

            <p>Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation. Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.</p>

Our simulations reveal that SKR decreases exponentially with transmission distance, with performance further degraded by increasing thermal noise and phase noise, particularly under high thermal noise conditions.

            <p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers. However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.</p>

            <p>Decoherence in quantum devices, such as qubits and resonators, is often caused by bistable fluctuators modeled as random telegraph noise (RTN), leading to significant dephasing. We analyze the impact of individual and multiple fluctuators on a bosonic mode in continuous variable systems, identifying non-Markovian behavior governed by two timescales: the fluctuator switching rate ($\xi$) and coupling strength ($\nu$). Using the Breuer-Piilo-Laine (BLP) measure, we show that for Gaussian states, squeezing and thermal fluctuations do not enhance non-Markovianity. In contrast, for non-Gaussian states, the measure becomes unbounded. For rotation-symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, known for their error correction advantages, non-Markovianity grows linearly with code symmetry. We evaluate the performance of RSB codes under simultaneous loss and RTN dephasing. For a teleportation-based Knill error-correction circuit, the codes perform robustly in the Markovian limit. In the non-Markovian regime, the performance depends on the time the error correction is performed for a given codeword. The average gate fidelity of the error-corrected state in this case exhibits oscillations as a function of time due to the oscillatory nature of the dephasing function of the RTN noise; however, for most of the parameter ranges, the values stay above the break-even point. Extending to multiple fluctuators that produce $1/f$ noise, we observe that non-Markovianity decays with increasing fluctuator count, while the performance of RSB codes remains effective with increasing number of fluctuators.</p>

            <p>Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>Certifying maximal quantum randomness without assumptions about system dimension remains a pivotal challenge for secure communication and foundational studies. Here, we introduce a generalized framework to directly certify maximal randomness from observed probability distributions across systems with arbitrary user numbers, without relying on the Bell-inequality violations. By analyzing probability distributions directly, we identify a class of quantum states and projective measurements that achieve maximal randomness in bipartite and tripartite scenarios, ensuring practical feasibility. Further analysis reveals a counterintuitive trade-off governing measurement incompatibility among users: sufficient incompatibility for one user permits arbitrarily small incompatibility for others, defying conventional symmetry assumptions in the Bell test. This asymmetry provides a pathway to optimize device-independent protocols by strategically distributing quantum resources. Our results establish a versatile and experimentally accessible route to scalable randomness certification, with implications for quantum cryptography and the physics of nonlocal correlations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spectral properties and quantum criticality of the two-photon Rabi-Stark model. Using the exact solution of this model, we rigorously derive a condition for complete spectral collapse, where all bound states vanish. In this case, the energy gap closes at a critical coupling, signaling a continuous quantum phase transition. The corresponding gap exponent differs from those in both the one-photon Rabi-Stark model and the quantum Rabi model, suggesting a distinct universality class. While in the general case, an infinite number of discrete bound states exist when spectral collapse occur and the energy gap remains open. By mapping to an inverse square potential well, these bound levels approach the threshold energy exponentially. Our results offer new insights into novel spectral phenomena in nonlinear quantum Rabi models, with potential implications for experimental realizations in circuit QED and trapped ion systems.</p>

Using Tensor Networks simulations, we study both elastic and inelastic scattering and provide a detailed analysis of energy transfer, entanglement entropy, and new particle production during the dynamics. In addition, we design an efficient quantum circuit for meson wave packet preparation using Givens rotations, significantly reducing the circuit depth compared to existing methods.

Our model assumes that circuit depth is sufficient for depolarizing noise, producing corrupted observations that resemble a uniform distribution alongside classical bit-flip errors from readout. Our method consists of two steps: a filtering stage that discards uninformative depolarizing noise and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that computes a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate over the remaining data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on small-qubit systems using IBM circuit simulations in Qiskit and compare its performance to contemporary statistical QEM techniques. We also show that our method scales to larger qubit counts using synthetically generated data consistent with our noise model. These results suggest that principled statistical methods can offer scalable and interpretable solutions for quantum error mitigation in realistic NISQ settings.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatrice Magni, Xhek Turkeshi</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Papatryfonos, Louis Vervoort</p>
            <p>We propose two quantum experiments - modified Bell tests - that could detect contextual hidden variables underlying quantum mechanics. The experiments are inspired by hydrodynamic pilot-wave systems that mimic a wide range of quantum effects and exhibit a classical analog of contextuality. To justify the experiments, we show that contextual hidden variables are 'physics as usual' if a unification between quantum mechanics and general relativity is possible. Accordingly, contextual theories can bypass Bell's theorem in a way that is both local and non-conspiratorial. We end with a note on the relevance of exploratory experiments in the foundations of quantum physics.</p>

The underpinning hardware must be engineered to generate, manipulate and detect quantum phenomena with exceptional performance, whilst being mass-manufacturable for real-world applications.

The continuous-variable regime for quantum optics has been exploited in a number of technologies, including the detection of gravitational waves, by operating below the standard quantum limit of the light's shot noise. The availability of room-temperature, deterministic sources and high efficiency detectors suitable for continuous-variable state generation and measurement is a compelling motivation for this particular paradigm. This review focusses on efforts to integrate sources and detectors of continuous-variable light states into chip-scale photonic integrated circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Senrui Chen, Akel Hashim, Noah Goss, Alireza Seif, Irfan Siddiqi, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>Noise is a major challenge for building practical quantum computing systems. Precise characterization of quantum noise is crucial for developing effective error mitigation and correction schemes. However, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors on many current platforms can introduce large ambiguity into conventional noise characterization methods. In this work, we propose a scheme for enhancing quantum noise characterization using additional energy levels. We first develop a comprehensive theory on the identifiability of n-qudit SPAM noise given high-quality single-qudit control, showing the existence of gauge freedoms which can be completely described using subsystem depolarizing maps. We then show how to use these extra energy levels to reduce the gauge ambiguity in characterizing both SPAM and gate noise in the qubit subspace. We experimentally implement these ideas on a superconducting quantum computing device and demonstrate a qutrit-enabled enhancement in noise characterization precision.</p>

The approach is based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented in recent literature.

The method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for $d>2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity.

            <p>Symmetric quantum states are fascinating objects. They correspond to multipartite systems that remain invariant under particle permutations. This symmetry is reflected in their compact mathematical characterisation but also in their unique physical properties: they exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement and notable robustness against noise and perturbations. These features make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical structure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the theoretical framework, robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties of symmetric states in experimental settings are essential. In this regard, we explore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell tests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric systems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant applications in which these states outperform other classes of states in specific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum metrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine their contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present the current state-of-the-art in their experimental generation, ranging from systems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review the most significant results obtained in the different experimental realizations. Despite the notable progress made in recent years with regard to the characterisation and application of symmetric quantum states, several intriguing questions remain unsolved. We conclude this review by discussing some of these open problems and outlining promising directions for future research.</p>

            <h2>Isoholonomic inequalities and speed limits for cyclic quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ole Sönnerborn</p>
            <p>Quantum speed limits set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve between states. Traditional bounds, such as those by Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin, rely on state distinguishability and become trivial for cyclic evolutions where the initial and final states coincide. In this work, we explore an alternative approach based on isoholonomic inequalities, which bound the length of closed state space trajectories in terms of their holonomy. Building on a gauge-theoretic framework for mixed state geometric phases, we extend the concept of isoholonomic inequalities to closed curves of isospectral and isodegenerate density operators. This allows us to derive new quantum speed limits that remain nontrivial for cyclic evolutions. Our results reveal deep connections between the temporal behavior of cyclic quantum systems and holonomy.</p>

            <p>Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</p>

            <p>Designing effective quantum kernels is a central challenge in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), particularly under the limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices with a limited number of qubits, error-prone gate operations, and restricted qubit connectivity. To address this, we propose HaQGNN, a hardware-aware quantum kernel design method that integrates quantum device topology, noise characteristics, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to evaluate and select task-relevant quantum circuits that define quantum kernels. First, each quantum circuit is represented as a directed acyclic graph that encodes hardware-specific features, including gate types, target qubits, and noise characteristics. Next, two GNNs are trained to predict surrogate metrics, Probability of Successful Trials (PST) and Kernel-Target Alignment (KTA), for fast and accurate fidelity and performance estimation. Additionally, feature selection is further incorporated to reduce input dimensionality and improve compatibility with limited-qubit devices. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, Credit Card (CC), MNIST-5, and FMNIST-4, demonstrate that HaQGNN outperforms existing baselines in terms of classification accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of learning-based and hardware-aware strategies for advancing practical quantum kernel design on near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Quantum measurements are inherently noisy, hindering reliable entanglement detection and limiting the scalability of quantum technologies. While error mitigation and correction strategies exist, they often impose prohibitive resource overheads. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to achieve noise-resilient entanglement classification even with imperfect measurements. Using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on features extracted from Pauli measurements, we develop a robust optimal entanglement witness (ROEW) that remains effective under unknown measurement noise. By optimizing SVM parameters against worst-case errors, our protocol significantly outperforms conventional methods in classification accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ROEW achieves high-fidelity entanglement detection with minimal measurements, even when measurement errors exceed 10\%. This work bridges machine learning and quantum information science, offering a practical tool for noise-robust quantum characterization and advancing the feasibility of entanglement-based technologies in real-world settings.</p>

            <p>Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task: approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown $d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound $\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an average-case distance error. Moreover, our result implies a query lower bound $\Omega(d^2)$ for approximately implementing control-$U$ up to an irrelevant phase, which is also tight with respect to the dimension.</p>

            <p>We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</p>

However, identifying higher-order topological structures -- such as $k$-cliques, fundamental building blocks of complex networks -- remains a significant challenge. Here we develop a universal programmable photonic quantum processor that enables the encoding of arbitrary complex-weight networks, providing a direct pathway to uncovering their topological structures. We demonstrate how this quantum approach can identify weighted $k$-cliques and estimate Betti numbers by leveraging the Gaussian boson sampling algorithm's ability to preferentially select high-weight, dense subgraphs. The unique capabilities of our programmable quantum processor allow us to observe topological phase transitions and identify clique percolation phenomena directly from the entropy of the sampling results. These findings showcase how photonic quantum computing can be applied to analyse the topological characteristics of real-world complex networks, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced data analysis.</p>

            <p>Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</p>

            <p>In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.</p>

            <p>We introduce a convergent hierarchy of lower bounds on the minimum value of a real form over the unit sphere. The main practical advantage of our hierarchy over the real sum-of-squares (RSOS) hierarchy is that the lower bound at each level of our hierarchy is obtained by a minimum eigenvalue computation, as opposed to the full semidefinite program (SDP) required at each level of RSOS. In practice, this allows us to compute bounds on much larger forms than are computationally feasible for RSOS. Our hierarchy outperforms previous alternatives to RSOS, both asymptotically and in numerical experiments. We obtain our hierarchy by proving a reduction from real optimization on the sphere to Hermitian optimization on the sphere, and invoking the Hermitian sum-of-squares (HSOS) hierarchy. This opens the door to using other Hermitian optimization techniques for real optimization, and gives a path towards developing spectral hierarchies for more general constrained real optimization problems. To this end, we use our techniques to develop a hierarchy of eigencomputations for computing the real tensor spectral norm.</p>

            <p>We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE) if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in MATE. Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta^{fF}$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0^{fF}$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0^{fF}$. Here, we first point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds, i.e., if every eigenbasis lies in MATE, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0^{fF}$. Inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0^{fF}$ for which MATE can be proved more easily than for the others, with smaller error bounds, and also in higher spatial dimensions, we show for any given $H_0$ that the existence of one eigenbasis in MATE implies quite generally that most eigenbases of $H_0$ lie in MATE. We also show that, as a consequence, after adding a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$, for most perturbations $V$ the perturbed Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies ETH and all states thermalize.</p>

            <h2>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyakka Nakada, Kotaro Tanahashi, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.</p>

            <p>The study of undecidability in problems arising from physics has experienced a renewed interest, mainly in connection with quantum information problems. The goal of this review is to survey this recent development. After a historical introduction, we first explain the necessary results about undecidability in mathematics and computer science. Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems.</p>

            <h2>Post-Newtonian Effective Field Theory Approach to Entanglement Harvesting, Quantum Discord and Bell's Nonlocality Bound Near a Black Hole</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Li Lin, Sayid Mondal</p>
            <p>Black holes, as characterized by the Hawking effect and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can be treated as a compact object carrying nontrivial quantum information obscured behind the event horizon. Thus, the black hole may convey and retract its quantum information to the nearby quantum probes via the surrounding mediator fields. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a quantum black hole on the reduced states of a pair of static qubit-type Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors acting as a probe, using three complementary quantum information measures: concurrence characterizing entanglement harvesting, quantum discord, and Bell's nonlocality bound. This sheds light on the nature of the quantum state of the black holes. By treating the black hole as a tidally deformable thermal body under the quantum fluctuation of the mediator fields as observed in \cite{Goldberger:2019sya, goldberger2020virtual, biggs2024comparing}, we employ a post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT) to derive the reduced states of the UDW probes analytically. Based on this, we can easily obtain all three quantum information measures without encountering the complicated Matsubara sum of infinite thermal poles, as in the conventional approach based on quantum fields in curved spacetime. By tuning the relative strengths in the action of PN-EFT, we can extract the effects of the black hole on the entanglement, quantum correlation, and nonlocality bound of the UDW probe systems. Our PN-EFT approach can be extended to include the backreaction on the black holes in future studies by taking the higher-order PN corrections into account.</p>

            <h2>Dependence of scalar matter vacuum energy, induced by a magnetic topological defect, on the coupling to space-time curvature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.M. Gorkavenko, A.O. Zaporozhchenko, M.S. Tsarenkova</p>
            <p>We considered the vacuum polarization of a quantized charged scalar matter field in the background of a topological defect modeled by a finite-thickness tube with magnetic flux inside. The tube is impenetrable for quantum matter, and a generalized boundary condition of the Robin type is imposed at its surface. We have shown that in the flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy does not depend on the coupling $(\xi)$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature, only for the partial cases of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the tube's edge. However, for generalized Robin boundary conditions, the total induced energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in flat space-time, at least for negative values of the boundary condition parameter $-\pi/2<\theta<0$.</p>

            <h2>Classical Combinatorial Optimization Scaling for Random Ising Models on 2D Heavy-Hex Graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske, Andreas Bärtschi, Stephan Eidenbenz</p>
            <p>Motivated by near term quantum computing hardware limitations, combinatorial optimization problems that can be addressed by current quantum algorithms and noisy hardware with little or no overhead are used to probe capabilities of quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this study, a specific class of near term quantum computing hardware defined combinatorial optimization problems, Ising models on heavy-hex graphs both with and without geometrically local cubic terms, are examined for their classical computational hardness via empirical computation time scaling quantification. Specifically the Time-to-Solution metric using the classical heuristic simulated annealing is measured for finding optimal variable assignments (ground states), as well as the time required for the optimization software Gurobi to find an optimal variable assignment. Because of the sparsity of these Ising models, the classical algorithms are able to find optimal solutions efficiently even for large instances (i.e. $100,000$ variables). The Ising models both with and without geometrically local cubic terms exhibit average-case linear-time or weakly quadratic scaling when solved exactly using Gurobi, and the Ising models with no cubic terms show evidence of exponential-time Time-to-Solution scaling when sampled using simulated annealing. These findings point to the necessity of developing and testing more complex, namely more densely connected, optimization problems in order for quantum computing to ever have a practical advantage over classical computing. Our results are another illustration that different classical algorithms can indeed have exponentially different running times, thus making the identification of the best practical classical technique important in any quantum computing vs. classical computing comparison.</p>

            <h2>Critical Dynamics of Spin Boson Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. G. Vasin, S. V. Remizov, A. A. Elistratov</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto \omega^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana spinors. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum-classical mapping, since it is applicable for $s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and the weakly subohmic case $s\lesssim 1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the ohmic bosonic thermal bath.</p>

Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive, within a non-pertubative treatment of disorder effects, the third-order nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps. In the weak nonlinear regime of our formalism, we demonstrate the ability of the echo peak to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes, in perfect agreement with the intuition developed in isolated two-level systems. Furthermore, we discuss unique many-body effects on the echo peak signature arising from interaction induced quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show that these quantum fluctuations induce a finite nonrephasable broadening and examine how the echo peak is influenced by the attractive or repulsive nature of the collective excitations.</p>

The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows an extended combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Ping Su, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Käding</p>
            <p>It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.</p>

Here, we present a computational framework that combines an efficient electromagnetic scattering solver with the adjoint method to inversely design printable microparticles tailored for levitated optomechanics. Our method allows identifying optimized geometries, characterized by enhanced optical trapping and detection efficiencies compared to conventional microspheres. This improves the feasibility of quantum-limited motional control of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom in a standard standing-wave optical trap.</p>

            <h2>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Ansari, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Abdi</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</p>

            <p>Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in future optical quantum technologies. For most applications, scalable on-demand fabrication is a key requirement. Recent advances using localized electron irradiation have demonstrated near-identical emitters in the blue and yellow spectral regions. While the blue emitters have been demonstrated in cryogenic temperatures, the yellow emitters remain uncharacterized under such conditions. In this work, we therefore extended the study of yellow emitters to cryogenic temperatures. Initially, multiple spectral features were observed, prompting a systematic investigation that led to the identification of a defect emission centered around 547.5 nm with high brightness and excellent photostability. By tuning the excitation wavelength, we are able to distinguish Raman scattering peaks from the emitter emission. Further analysis of the vibronic emissions allowed us to identify an optical phonon mode, whose contribution becomes increasingly dominant at elevated temperatures. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE) reveals excitation through this phonon mode enhances the emission by almost 5-fold in cryogenic temperature. Temperature-dependent studies further elucidate the role of phonons in the emission process. These observations deepen our understanding of the nature of the emitters, opening new avenues for precise tuning of quantum light sources.</p>

Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the future.</p>

As particular cases, specified by values of $p$ and $q$ parameters it includes symmetric and non-symmetric $q$-oscillators, Fibonacci and Fibonacci divisors hierarchy of Golden oscillators, Tamm-Dankov oscillator etc. By $pq$-deformed supersymmetric annihilation operator, the set of corresponding supersymmetric coherent states is introduced. The states are characterized by the pair of $pq$-quantum states from the Fock space or equivalently, by the set of infinite number of qubit states. Entanglement of fermions with $pq$-deformed bosons is characterized by the concurrence as the linear entropy, taking form of the Gram determinant of inner products. As shown, for two types of the reference states, the concurrence depends on values of $p$ and $q$ parameters, and it reaches the value one for the maximally entangled states. Entanglement of the super-coherent states and the uncertainty relations for the coordinate and momentum in these states are calculated. Non-classical nature of the entangled states is reflected in non-minimal character of the uncertainty relations.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling circuits such as random unitaries. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</p>

            <p>Long-range quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and sensing applications require robust and reliable ways to encode transmitted quantum information. In this context, time-bin encoding has emerged as a promising candidate due to its resilience to mechanical and thermal perturbations, depolarization from refractive index changes, and birefringence in fiber optic media. Time-bin quantum bits (qubits) can be produced in various ways, and each implementation calls for different considerations regarding design parameters, component compatibility (optical, electrical, electro-optical), and measurement procedures. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of experimental methods for preparing and characterizing time-bin qubits (TBQs) for quantum communication protocols, with an assessment of their advantages and limitations. We discuss challenges in transmitting TBQs over optical fibers and free-space channels, and methods to overcome them. We also analyze the selection of key time-bin parameters and component requirements across experiments. This leads us to explore the preparation and characterization of time-bin entanglement and examine requirements for interference of time-bins from separate sources. Further, we cover preparation and characterization techniques for high-dimensional time-bin states, namely qudits, and the generation of time-bin entangled qudit pairs. We review time-energy entanglement and key experimental realizations. Finally, we present notable applications of time-bin encoded quantum states, from quantum communication protocols to photonic quantum computation.

We introduce two algorithms for simulating $PT$-symmetric systems near exceptional points where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. The first is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and the second reduces the classical component by using an ancilla qubit. We then use perturbation theory to extend this method to consider the dynamics of two weakly interacting $PT$-symmetric systems. Demonstrations on a quantum device and noisy simulators validate the algorithm on current quantum devices, offering potential for scalable simulations of $PT$-symmetric systems and pseudo-Hermitian operators in quantum computation.</p>

            <p>In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates -- provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational ans{ä}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits. Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain non-trivial for quantum approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Roscilde, Meenu Kumari, Alexandre Cooper, Fabio Mezzacapo</p>
            <p>The efficient preparation of scalable multipartite entanglement is a central goal in the development of next-generation quantum devices. In this work, we show that the so-called ``twist-and-turn" (TaT) dynamics for interacting spin ensembles, generated by Hamiltonians with U(1)-symmetric interactions and with a transverse field, can offer an important resource to reach this goal. For models with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key features: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as quantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2) scalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a time growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an exponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly in the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and numerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar interactions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not develop for large system sizes and/or strong fields. For dipolar interactions, the entanglement dynamics at intermediate times is completely at odds with thermalization; and it appears to saturate the maximum speed of entanglement buildup allowed by Lieb-Robinson bounds generalized to power-law interacting systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taotao Yan, Jinchuan Hou, Xiaofei Qi, Kan He</p>
            <p>Gaussian measurements can not be used to witness nonlocality in Gaussian states as well as the network nonlocality in networks of continuous-variable (CV) systems. Thus special non-Gaussian measurements have to be utilized. In the present paper, we first propose a kind of nonlinear Bell-type inequality that is applicable to quantum networks of both finite or infinite dimensional systems. Violation of the inequality will witness the network nonlocality. This inequality allows us to propose a method of the supremum strategy for detecting network nonlocality in CV systems with source states being any multipartite multi-mode Gaussian states according to the configurations of the networks by utilizing non-Gaussian measurements based on generalized quasiprobability functions. The nonlinear Bell-type inequalities for CV networks, which depend solely on the generalized quasiprobability functions of Gaussian states, are straightforward to construct and implement. As illustrations, we propose the corresponding nonlinear Bell-type inequalities for any chain, star, tree-shaped and cyclic networks in CV systems with source states being $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states. The examples show that this approach works well for witnessing the nonlocality in networks of CV systems. Particularly, a thorough discussion is given for the entanglement swapping network. Our study provide a strong signature for the network nonlocality nature of CV systems and lead to precise recipes for its experimental verification.</p>

            <p>We compare the semiclassical and quantum predictions for the unitary dynamics of a two-level atom interacting with a single-mode electromagnetic field in the presence of parametric modulation of the atomic parameters, in the regime of multiphoton atom-field resonances. We derive approximate analytic solutions for the semiclassical Rabi model when the atomic transition frequency and the atom-field coupling strength undergo harmonic external modulations. These solutions are compared to the predictions of the quantum Rabi model, which is solved numerically for the initial coherent state with a large average photon number, of the order of $10^4$, in the regime of three-photon resonance. We show that for initial times and sufficiently intense coherent state the semiclassical dynamics agrees quite well with the quantum one, although for large times it inevitably fails due to the lack of the collapse-revival behavior. Furthermore, we describe how the field state is modified throughout the evolution, presenting numeric results for the average photon number, entropies (related to the atom-field entanglement) and other quantities that characterize the photon number statistics of the electromagnetic field.</p>

            <p>Modular architectures are a promising approach to scaling quantum computers beyond the limits of monolithic designs. However, non-local communications between different quantum processors might significantly impact overall system performance. In this work, we investigate the role of the network infrastructure in modular quantum computing architectures, focusing on coherence loss due to communication constraints. We analyze the impact of classical network latency on quantum teleportation and identify conditions under which it becomes a bottleneck. Additionally, we study different network topologies and assess how communication resources affect the number and parallelization of inter-core communications. Finally, we conduct a full-stack evaluation of the architecture under varying communication parameters, demonstrating how these factors influence the overall system performance. The results show that classical communication does not become a bottleneck for systems exceeding one million qubits, given current technology assumptions, even with modest clock frequencies and parallel wired interconnects. Additionally, increasing quantum communication resources generally shortens execution time, although it may introduce additional communication overhead. The optimal number of quantum links between QCores depends on both the algorithm being executed and the chosen inter-core topology. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing modular architectures, enabling scalable quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>New scattering zones in quantum speckle propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaurya Aarav, S. A. Wadood, Jason W Fleischer</p>
            <p>Quantum speckles exhibit significantly richer behavior than their classical counterparts due to their higher dimensionality. A simple example is the far-field speckle pattern in 1D light scattering: classical light forms 1D speckles defined by the numerical aperture, whereas biphoton scattering depends in addition on the photon correlation length, forming 2D elliptical speckles. To date, the behavior of quantum speckles for shorter propagation distances has not been considered. We remedy this here by considering the paraxial evolution of two-photon entanglement at arbitrary propagation distances from an isotropic scatterer. We show, theoretically, numerically, and experimentally, that the two length scales of the biphoton introduce a new Fresnel regime between the conventional near and far fields. Further, we show that the quantum near field is characterized by speckles with a square shape that remain constant during propagation. In contrast, the intermediate regime can be engineered to have a constant speckle size along the sum coordinate but a linearly expanding speckle size along the difference coordinate, with a speckle shape that transitions from square to elliptical. The results merge quantum coherence with scattering statistics and suggest new regimes of operation for correlation-based quantum sensing and imaging.</p>

            <p>We present a detailed study of an adiabatic state preparation in an effective three-level quantum system. States can be prepared with high speed and fidelity by adding a counterdiabatic quantum control protocol. As a second step, we invert the preparation protocol to get back to the initial state. This describes an overall cyclic evolution in state space. Using counterdiabatic terms, the resulting composed fast evolution can be repeated many times. We then analyze the control of Berry's phase along the adiabatic cyclic path, and show that Berry's phase can act as a sensitive detector of non-perfect state transfer.</p>

            <h2>Towards solving large QUBO problems using quantum algorithms: improving the LogQ scheme</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yagnik Chatterjee, Jérémie Messud</p>
            <p>The LogQ algorithm encodes Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems with exponentially fewer qubits than the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The advantages of conventional LogQ are accompanied by a challenge related to the optimization of its free parameters, which requires the usage of resource intensive evolutionary or even global optimization algorithms. We propose a new LogQ parameterization that can be optimized with a gradient-inspired method, which is less resource-intensive and thus strengthens the advantage of LogQ over QAOA for large/industrial problems. We illustrate the features of our method on an analytical model and present larger scale numerical results on MaxCut problems.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Orbit Structure and Helicity Anomaly in Relativistic Electron Vortex Beams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongze Guo, Bei Xu, Qiang Gu</p>
            <p>The relativistic electron vortex beam (REVB) has attracted increasing attention due to its nontrivial spin-orbit structure recently. As relativistic electrons are governed by the Dirac equation, exact solutions to this equation provide the most reliable starting point for understanding angular momentum characteristics of REVBs. In this work, a set of exact eigensolutions of the Dirac equation are derived in a complex cylindrical coordinate system using a generalized series expansion method. We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries net angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the total angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit expression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show that helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a practical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.</p>

            <h2>Arbitrary high-fidelity binomial codes from multiphoton spin-boson interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pradip Laha, Peter van Loock</p>
            <p>Encoding a qubit in the continuous degrees of freedom of a quantum system, such as bosonic modes, is a powerful alternative to modern quantum error correction (QEC). Among the most prominent bosonic QEC codes, binomial codes provide protection against loss and dephasing errors by encoding logical states in superpositions of Fock states with binomially weighted coefficients. While much attention has been given to their error-correcting capabilities and integration into fault-tolerant architectures, efficient methods for generating arbitrary binomial codewords remain scarce. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for generating these codewords by exploiting nonlinear multiphoton interactions between a continuous-variable bosonic mode (oscillator) and a two-level system (spin/qubit). Our proposed scheme assumes the ability to prepare the oscillator in an arbitrary Fock state and the qubit in an arbitrary superposition of its basis states and access to arbitrarily high multiphoton interactions. To enhance the experimental feasibility of our scheme, we further demonstrate how to reduce the required order parameter of multiphoton interactions by a factor of two for a special class of code states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anwei Zhang, C. M. Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric sources. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md. Saif Hassan Onim, Travis S. Humble, Himanshu Thapliyal</p>
            <p>We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of 36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living conditions.</p>

            <h2>Polarization dynamics in vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thorsten Ackemann, Markus Sondermann</p>
            <p>Experiments and their interpretation on polarization dynamics and polarization switching in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers operated in the fundamental transverse mode regime are reviewed. Important observations are switching events to a mode with the lower unsaturated gain and the existence of elliptically polarized dynamical transition states after the destabilization of the low-frequency polarization mode. The observations demonstrate the need to consider explicitly the phase properties of the optical field as well as nonlinear effects affecting polarization selection above threshold. Good qualitative agreement is found with a model which takes into account the spin degrees of freedom of the light field as well as of the carriers (`spin-flip model'), if the spin-flip rate is taken to be some tens of $10^9$~s$^{-1}$. This constitutes a strong -- though indirect -- indication that spin dependent processes are important in polarization selection in the devices investigated.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-less Brillouin strong coupling in a solid-state continuous system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Blázquez Martínez, Changlong Zhu, Birgit Stiller</p>
            <p>Strongly coupling two systems allows them to exchange coherent information before the systems decohere. This important regime in light-matter interactions has predominantly been reached in optical resonator configurations. In this work, we present the experimental realization of strong coupling between optical and acoustic fields within a continuum of modes in a cavity-less configuration after a single-pass through an optical waveguide. The underlying physical effect of anti-Stokes Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a highly nonlinear fiber at T = 4 K allows us to experimentally demonstrate strong coupling in a waveguide scenario. We show the splitting of the optoacoustic spectral response and introduce a novel technique to measure the avoided crossing of hybrid optoacoustic modes via forced detuning. This demonstration opens a path towards in-line acoustic-waves-based quantum signal processing in waveguide systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. M. Majczak, K. Krajewska, A. Bechler, J. Z. Kamiński</p>
            <p>We study helicity correlations of electron-positron pairs created by a homogeneous time-dependent electric field in the Sauter-Schwinger scenario. Our analysis is based on solving the Dirac equation with the Feynman or anti-Feynman boundary conditions, which is equivalent to the scattering matrix approach widely used in high energy physics. Most importantly, both these methods allow to fully account for the helicity (or, more generally, spin) correlations of created particles. The influence of helicity correlations and the carrier-envelope phase of the electric pulse on the properties of topological structures (such as spirals and vortices) in momentum distributions of created particles is investigated. The generation of maximally entangled helicity states is discussed and the possibility of using a short electric pulse as a fast switch between them is indicated.</p>

            <p>Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</p>

            <h2>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sami Kaya, Pratik Rath, Kyle Ritchie</p>
            <p>Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the Rényi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</p>

            <p>The experimental verification of multipartite entangled states is essential for advancing quantum information processing. Entanglement witnesses (EWs) provide a widely used and experimentally accessible approach for detecting genuinely multipartite entangled states. In this work, we theoretically derive the entanglement witness for the four-qubit Dicke state and experimentally evaluate it on two distinct IBM 127-qubit Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), namely ibm\_sherbrook and ibm\_brisbane. A negative expectation value of the witness operator serves as a sufficient condition for confirming genuine multipartite entanglement. We report the maximum (negative) values of the witness achieved on these QPUs as $-0.178 \pm 0.009$ and $-0.169 \pm 0.002$, corresponding to two different state preparation protocols. Additionally, we theoretically investigate the effect of various noise channels on the genuine entanglement of a four-qubit Dicke state using the Qiskit Aer simulator. We show the behavior of the EW constructed under the assumption of Markovian and non-Markovian amplitude damping and depolarizing noises, bit-phase flip noise, and readout errors. We also investigate the effect of varying thermal relaxation time on the EW, depicting a bound on the $T_1$ time required for successful generation of a Dicke State on a superconducting QPU.</p>

We prove convergence guarantees on our classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm, which also extends to our quantum apprenticeship learning algorithm. We also show that, as compared to its classical counterpart, our quantum algorithm achieves an improvement in the per-iteration time complexity by a quadratic factor in the dimension of the feature vectors $k$ and the size of the action space $A$.</p>

By controlling the two-tone driving of the optical cavity and the microwave driving of the LC circuit, the strong squeezing of both the microwave field of the LC circuit and the mechanical mode will be obtained. Moreover, by further altering the driving power of the system, the perfect one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between the optical cavity and the mechanical oscillator will be generated. The degree of the one-way EPR steering can be controlled by the driving light of the system. We also show the robustness of the squeezing and EPR steering against environmental temperature.

These kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs) operate via three-wave mixing (3WM) to achieve high broadband gain and near-quantum-limited (nQL) noise. Representative fabricated devices -- realized using an inverted microstrip (IMS), dispersion-engineered, artificial transmission line -- demonstrate power gains above 25 dB, bandwidths beyond 3 GHz, and achieve ultimate system noise levels of 1.1 quanta even when operated with no magnetic shielding. These performance metrics are competitive with state-of-the-art Josephson-junction-based TWPAs but involve simpler fabrication and able to providing three orders of magnitude higher dynamic range ($IIP_1 = -68$ dBm, $IIP_3 = -55$ dBm), and high magnetic field resilience -- making KITs an attractive technology for highly multiplexed readout of quantum information and superconducting detector systems.</p>

            <p>We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real superconducting-qubit hardware.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights to quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ammar Kirmani, Elijah Pelofske, Andreas Bärtschi, Stephan Eidenbenz, Jian-Xin Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin H. H. Zhang, Daniel Malz, Peter Rabl</p>
            <p>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</p>

For processes where some of the external particles are identical, we find the first hints of a potential quantum advantage. We validate our techniques using simulated quantum computers. Furthermore, for toy examples we also demonstrate our algorithms on a 56-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer.

This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</p>

In the zero-mass limit the VEVs of the electric and magnetic field squares and the condensate reduce to the corresponding expressions for a massless vector field. The same is the case for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor in the problem with PEC conditions. However, for PMC conditions the zero-mass limit for the vacuum energy-momentum tensor differs from the corresponding VEV for a massless field. This difference in the zero-mass limits is related to the different influences of the boundary conditions on the longitudinal polarization mode of a massive vector field. The PMC conditions constrain all the polarization modes including the longitudinal mode, whereas PEC conditions do not influence the longitudinal mode. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor is diagonal. The normal stress is uniformly distributed in the region between the plates and vanishes in the remaining regions. The corresponding Casimir forces are attractive for both boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Approximate Optimization: A New Variational Monte Carlo Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdelrahman S. Abdelrahman, Shuvro Chowdhury, Flaviano Morone, Kerem Y. Camsari</p>
            <p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p>

            <h2>Neural networks leverage nominally quantum and post-quantum representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M. Riechers, Thomas J. Elliott, Adam S. Shai</p>
            <p>We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs, pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the future.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Quantum behavior on frustrated Ising model: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seunghan Lee, Hunpyo Lee</p>
            <p>We investigated the quantum effects of a frustrated Ising model on a two-dimensional square lattice using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes. Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point, excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the increased role of quantum fluctuations.</p>

Leveraging this level of squeezing, we demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of approx. 1 pT$/$$\sqrt{Hz}$. The combination of vacuum-squeezed light and micrometer-scale vapor cells paves the way for compact, low-power-consumption atomic sensors with enhanced performance.</p>

This is a necessary extension for problems involving interactions between gravitational fields, for example, in the propagation of gravitational waves in external gravitational potentials. The 4xU(1) gauge invariance of unified gravity is preserved in this extension.</p>

            <p>Sensing with undetected photons has become a vibrant, application-driven research domain with a special focus on the mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength region. Since the mid-IR contains spectral bands with highly specific and strong molecular absorbance signatures, often referred to as fingerprints, a multitude of different samples and their compositions can be detected and quantified spectroscopically. Enhancing this inherently sample alteration-free spectroscopic method with imaging capabilities leads to a powerful technique for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications that enables automated diagnostics while omitting time-consuming and non-reversible labeling steps. To evade the shortcomings of state-of-the-art instruments for mid-IR hyperspectral microscopy related to cost, complexity, power-consumption, and performance, which are associated with technological challenges for mid-IR cameras and low-noise and broadband mid-IR sources, here, we construct a proof-of-concept nonlinear interferometer in a wide-field imaging arrangement combined with high-resolution spectral acquisition by pixelwise quantum Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For the broadband range of 2300-3100 cm$^{-1}$, covering the important CH-stretch band, we perform hyperspectral imaging that simultaneously resolves 3500 spatial modes, each with a spectral resolution of 10 cm$^{-1}$ leveraging in total around $10^5$ spatio-spectrally entangled photon modes. Our image acquisition uses a commercial, megapixel sCMOS camera, while a medium-power and compact c.w. pump laser is the only necessary light source.</p>

            <p>A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), as an efficient method of producing cold atoms from room-temperature atomic vapor, has been widely used to develop atomic sensors. Various compact MOTs using a single laser beam have been reported, simplifying apparatuses and leading to miniaturized devices. Here, we propose single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back pyramidal and conical mirrors. In such back-to-back mirrors, a MOT trapping volume is formed by an incident laser beam, a retroreflected beam, and multiple reflections from the mirror surfaces. We present the design of back-to-back mirrors and a series of compact MOT configurations, with the potential of increasing access to the MOT and simultaneously creating multiple MOTs. We demonstrate a MOT in a back-to-back conical mirror, loading 10 million rubidium-87 atoms from background vapor and cooling the atoms to 7 {\mu}K using polarization gradients. Single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back mirrors will contribute to building compact and scalable cold-atom-based sensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rushikesh A. Patil, Andreas W. W. Ludwig</p>
            <p>We present a general theorem demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}=(d c/dR)|_{R=1}$ under renormalization group (RG) flow in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit of a $R$-copy $2D$ conformal field theory (CFT) action $S_{*}$ perturbed by a replica interaction of the form $$-\mathbb{S}=-\sum_{a=1}^{R}S_{*}^{(a)}+\Delta\int d^2 x \sum_{\substack{a,b=1\\ a\neq b}}^{R}\varphi^{(a)}(x)\varphi^{(b)}(x).$$ Here $\varphi$ is a scaling field belonging to the CFT with action $S_*$ and the coupling $\Delta$ is relevant in the RG sense. We show that the infrared value of $c_{\text{eff}}$ is always $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unperturbed CFT $S_{*}$. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem". As an application of this theorem, we consider replica field theories in the limit of $R \to 1$ replicas of the form above, shown by Nahum and Jacobsen [arXiv:2504.01264] to describe $2D$ classical monitored systems, where measurements introduce a form of quenched randomness via Bayes' theorem. Lastly, we discuss a possible relationship of our theorem with the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}=(dc/dR)|_{R=0}$ for the above replica action in the different $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit, which is of relevance to systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, as opposed to measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Jachinowski, Peter B. Littlewood</p>
            <p>The Hepp-Lieb-Dicke model is ubiquitous in cavity quantum electrodynamics, describing spin-cavity coupling which does not conserve excitation number. Coupling the closed spin-cavity system to an environment realizes the open Dicke model, and by tuning the structure of the environment or the system-environment coupling, interesting spin-only models can be engineered. In this work, we focus on a variation of the multi-species open Dicke model which realizes mediated nonreciprocal interactions between the spin species and, consequently, an interesting dynamical limit-cycle phase. In particular, we improve upon adiabatic elimination and, instead, employ a Redfield master equation in order to describe the effective dynamics of the spin-only system. We assess this approach at the mean-field level, comparing it both to adiabatic elimination and the full spin-cavity model, and find that the predictions are sensitive to the presence of single-particle incoherent decay. Additionally, we clarify the symmetries of the model and explore the dynamical limit-cycle phase in the case of explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking, finding a region of phase coexistence terminating at an codimension-two exceptional point. Lastly, we go beyond mean-field theory by exact numerical diagonalization of the master equation, appealing to permutation symmetry in order to increase the size of accessible systems. We find signatures of phase transitions even for small system sizes.</p>

            <p>Entangled biphoton sources exhibit nonclassical characteristics and have been applied to imaging techniques such as ghost imaging, quantum holography, and quantum optical coherence tomography. The development of wide-field quantum imaging to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to 2-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward bioimaging of cancer cells. We experimentally and theoretically prove that the configuration with balanced pathlengths illuminates an avenue for quantum-enhanced coincidence imaging at the Heisenberg limit.</p>

Acknowledging the fact that quantum methods underperform classical solvers, the primary goal of our research is to demonstrate how to leverage quantum noise as a computational resource for optimization. This work aims to showcase how the inherent noise in NISQ devices can be leveraged to solve such real-world problems effectively. Utilizing a D-Wave quantum annealer and IonQ's gate-based NISQ computers, we generate and analyze solutions for managing train traffic under stochastic disturbances. Our case study focuses on the Baltimore Light RailLink, which embodies the characteristics of both tramway and railway networks. We explore the feasibility of using NISQ technology to model the stochastic nature of disruptions in these transportation systems. Our research marks the inaugural application of both quantum computing paradigms to tramway and railway rescheduling, highlighting the potential of quantum noise as a beneficial resource in complex optimization scenarios.</p>

We show that if we allow non-adaptive or adaptive $X$ basis measurements, or allow non-adaptive $Z$ basis measurements, then the computational power remains the same as that of the original IQP model; and with adaptive $Z$ basis measurements the model becomes quantum universal. Furthermore we show that the computational model having circuits of only $CZ$ gates and adaptive $X$ basis measurements, with input states that are tensor products of 1-qubit states from the set $\{ |+\rangle, |1\rangle,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+i|1\rangle), \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\pi/4}|1\rangle) \} $, is quantum universal.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Cheng, Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti</p>
            <p>Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study both numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators that can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic decay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical predictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between analytics and the finite-size numerical data.</p>

Our analysis shows that while not all temporally correlated structures are detrimental, certain structures, particularly multi-time "streaky" correlations affecting syndrome qubits and two-qubit gates, can severely degrade logical error rate scaling. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of recent quantum error correction experiments on physical devices. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating non-Markovian noise toward achieving practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>An important challenge with the current generation of noisy, large-scale quantum computers is the question of validation. Does the hardware generate correct answers? If not, what are the errors? This issue is often combined with questions of computational advantage, but it is a fundamentally distinct issue. In current experiments, complete validation of the output statistics is generally not possible because it is exponentially hard to do so. Here, we apply phase-space simulation methods to partially verify recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) implementing photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors. The positive-P phase-space distribution is employed, as it uses probabilistic sampling to reduce complexity. It is \sim10^{18} times faster than direct classical simulation for experiments on 288 modes where quantum computational advantage is claimed. When combined with binning and marginalization to improve statistics, multiple validation tests are efficiently computable, of which some tests can be carried out on experimental data. We show that the data as a whole shows discrepancies with theoretical predictions for perfect squeezing. However, a small modification of the GBS parameters greatly improves agreement for some tests. We suggest that such validation tests could form the basis of feedback methods to improve GBS experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Garhofer, Oliver Bringmann</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its derived variants are widely in use for approximating combinatorial optimization problem instances on gate-based Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Commonly, circuits required for QAOA are constructed by first reformulating a given problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. It is then straightforward to synthesize a QAOA circuit from QUBO equations. In this work, we illustrate a more qubit-efficient circuit construction for combinatorial optimization problems by the example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Conventionally, the qubit encoding in QAOA for the TSP describes a tour using a sequence of nodes, where each node is written as a 1-hot binary vector. We propose to encode TSP tours by selecting edges included in the tour. Removing certain redundancies, the number of required qubits can be reduced by a linear factor compared to the aforementioned conventional encoding. We examined implementations of both QAOA encoding variants in terms of their approximation quality and runtime. Our experiments show that for small instances results are just as accurate using our proposed encoding, whereas the number of required classical optimizer iterations increases only slightly.</p>

            <p>Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing represents a significant advancement in computational capabilities. Of particular concern is its impact on asymmetric cryptography through, notably, Shor's algorithm and the more recently developed Regev's algorithm for factoring composite numbers. We present our implementation of the latter. Our analysis encompasses both quantum simulation results and classical component examples, with particular emphasis on comparative cases between Regev's and Shor's algorithms. Our experimental results reveal that Regev's algorithm indeed outperforms Shor's algorithm for certain composite numbers in practice. However, we observed significant performance variations across different input values. Despite Regev's algorithm's theoretical asymptotic efficiency advantage, our implementation exhibited execution times longer than Shor's algorithm for small integer factorization in both quantum and classical components. These findings offer insights into the practical challenges and performance characteristics of implementing Regev's algorithm in realistic quantum computing scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Non-positive energy quasidistributions in coherent collision models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Pezzutto, Gabriele De Chiara, Stefano Gherardini</p>
            <p>We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</p>

            <h2>Cross-Problem Parameter Transfer in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: A Machine Learning Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kien X. Nguyen, Bao Bach, Ilya Safro</p>
            <p>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</p>

            <h2>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Gamba, Bingyu Cui, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin H. H. Zhang, Daniel Malz, Peter Rabl</p>
            <p>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ammar Kirmani, Elijah Pelofske, Andreas Bärtschi, Stephan Eidenbenz, Jian-Xin Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</p>

            <h2>Fast and High Excitation Transport in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Tang Yu, I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Wei Chen, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights to quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>The effect of partial post-selection on quantum discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qipeng Qian, Christos N. Gagatsos</p>
            <p>The discrimination of quantum states is a central problem in quantum information science and technology. Meanwhile, partial post-selection has emerged as a valuable tool for quantum state engineering. In this work, we bring these two areas together and ask whether partial measurements can enhance the discrimination performance between two unknown and non-orthogonal pure states. Our framework is general: the two unknown states interact with the same environment-set in a pure state-via an arbitrary unitary transformation. A partial measurement is then performed on one of the output modes, modeled by an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM). We then allow classical communication to inform the unmeasured mode of the outcome of the partial measurement on the other mode, which is subsequently measured by a POVM that is optimal in the sense that the probability of error is minimized. The two POVMs act locally, but since we allow for classical communication between the two modes, we consider a scheme involving local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Under these considerations, we show that the minimum error probability, averaged over all possible post-selected branches, cannot be reduced below the minimum error probability of discriminating the original input states. In other words, prior state engineering via partial measurement does not improve the average discrimination performance. However, we also identify specific post-selection outcomes under which the conditional discrimination can achieve strictly lower error probabilities than the original optimal measurement, illustrating that while post-selection does not improve average performance, it can enable better discrimination in certain branches of the post-selected ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Ikeda, Sugumi Kanno, Jiro Soda</p>
            <p>In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states can enhance the conversion probability.</p>

            <h2>Robust Control of High-dimensional Quantum Systems against Coherent and Incoherent Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yidian Fan, Re-Bing Wu</p>
            <p>Toward scalable quantum computing, the control of quantum systems needs to be robust against both coherent errors induced by parametric uncertainties and incoherent errors induced by environmental decoherence. This poses significant challenges for high-dimensional systems due to the computational intensity involved in the control design process. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to improve the design efficiency. By employing the Taylor series expansion of uncertain parameters, the problem of robust control for an uncertain quantum system is reformulated as the optimal control problem of an augmented deterministic system. The Suzuki-Trotter expansion is then applied to accelerate the calculation of the system dynamics. Numerical simulations of quantum state preparation and quantum gate synthesis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify robust solutions in multi-qubit systems. The enhanced efficiency effectively extends the feasibility of high-order robust control for realistic high-dimensional quantum systems with multiple error sources.</p>

            <p>Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</p>

            <h2>Generalized tensor transforms and their applications in classical and quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel framework for Generalized Tensor Transforms (GTTs), constructed through an $n$-fold tensor product of an arbitrary $b \times b$ unitary matrix $W$. This construction generalizes many established transforms, by providing a adaptable set of orthonormal basis functions. Our proposed fast classical algorithm for GTT achieves an exponentially lower complexity of $O(N \log_b N)$ in comparison to a naive classical implementation that has an associated computational cost of $O(N^2)$. For quantum applications, our GTT-based algorithm, implemented in the natural spectral ordering, achieves both gate complexity and circuit depth of $O(\log_b N)$, where $N = b^n$ denotes the length of the input vector. This represents a quadratic improvement over Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which requires $O((\log_b N)^2)$ gates and depth for $n$ qudits, and an exponential advantage over classical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based and Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) based methods, which incur a computational cost of $O(N \log_b N)$. We explore diverse applications of GTTs in quantum computing, including quantum state compression and transmission, function encoding and quantum digital signal processing. The proposed framework provides fine-grained control of the transformation through the adjustable parameters of the base matrix $W$. This versatility allows precise shaping of each basis function while preserving their effective Walsh-type structure, thus tailoring basis representations to specific quantum data and computational tasks. Our numerical results demonstrate that GTTs enable improved performance in quantum state compression and function encoding compared to fixed transforms (such as FWHT or FFT), achieving higher fidelities with fewer retained components. We also provided novel classical and quantum digital signal filtering algorithms based on our GTT framework.</p>

            <p>Entanglement generation between distant nodes is a fundamental process in distributed quantum information processing. Qudits, high-dimensional quantum states, are promising candidates for enhancing entanglement distribution capabilities. However, the success probability of qudit entanglement distribution using Bell measurements is typically lower than that of conventional qubit-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement swapping protocol specifically designed for qutrits (three-dimensional quantum states). Our protocol employs photon-number encoding combined with an additional mode basis, such as polarization, effectively increasing the success probability. We show that the proposed qutrit protocol can achieve higher entanglement generation rates compared to conventional two-photon detection-based qubit protocols, especially under conditions of limited photon generation probability. Furthermore, we evaluate our protocol under realistic experimental imperfections, including photon loss and threshold detection, and show that it achieves high fidelity with probabilistic photon sources.</p>

            <p>Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</p>

            <p>Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</p>

We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</p>

At cryogenic temperatures, we access the weak coupling regime and observe a transition from the bad-emitter to the bad-cavity regime as the optical transition of the color center narrows. At 4 K, a Purcell factor exceeding 1.7 is measured, confirming cavity-enhanced emission.

Specifically, we employ a Mach-Zehnder interferometer after the photon pairs are generated from two nonlinear crystals. Our results indicate that polarization distinguishability at the time of generation leads to a loss of interference that cannot be restored by post-generation optical arrangements.

            <h2>Entanglement switching via mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> YouYoung Joung, Junmo Jeon, SungBin Lee</p>
            <p>We propose quasiperiodic chains with tunable mobility edge physics, as a promising platform for engineering long-range quantum entanglement. Using the generalized Aubry-André model, we show that the mobility edges play a key role in manipulating long-range indirect interactions in these systems. Near the mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations between sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial separation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one can induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement between distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic structures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues for entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <h2>Long-Lived Photon Blockade with Weak Optical Nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> You Wang, Xu Zheng, Timothy C. H. Liew, Y. D. Chong</p>
            <p>In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</p>

            <h2>On-chip magnon polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shugo Yoshii, Manuel Müller, Ryo Ohshima, Matthias Althammer, Yuichiro Ando, Hans Huebl, Masashi Shiraishi</p>
            <p>Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions. Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</p>

            <h2>Looking elsewhere: improving variational Monte Carlo gradients by importance sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Misery, Luca Gravina, Alessandro Santini, Filippo Vicentini</p>
            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.</p>

            <h2>Engineering giant transmon molecules as mediators of conditional two-photon gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomás Levy-Yeyati, Tomás Ramos, Alejandro González-Tudela</p>
            <p>Artificial atoms non-locally coupled to waveguides -- the so-called giant atoms -- offer new opportunities for the control of light and matter. In this work, we show how to use an array of non-locally coupled transmon "molecules" to engineer a passive photonic controlled gate for waveguide photons. In particular, we show that a conditional elastic phase shift between counter-propagating photons arises from the interplay between direction-dependent couplings, engineered through an interplay of non local interactions and molecular binding strength; and the nonlinearity of the transmon array. We analyze the conditions under which a maximal $\pi$-phase shift -- and hence a CZ gate -- is obtained, and characterize the gate fidelity as a function of key experimental parameters, including finite transmon nonlinearities, emitter spectral inhomogeneities, and limited cooperativity. Our work opens the use of giant atoms as key elements of microwave photonic quantum computing devices.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the influence of spatial curvature on the Jaynes-Cummings model. We employ an analog model of general relativity, representing the field inside a cavity using oscillators arranged in a circle instead of a straight line, where increasing curvature corresponds to a smaller circle radius. We investigate the nonclassical features of this quantum system arising from the interaction between a two-level atom and a deformed harmonic oscillator on a circle, which serves as curved-space counterpart to the flat oscillator. We analyze the time evolution of atom-field states and, based on this dynamic, examine how spatial curvature influences the Mandel parameter, entropy, and the behavior of the Wigner distribution function. Our results demonstrate that the spatial curvature plays critical roles in controlling these nonclassical properties.</p>

            <h2>Generated multi-transparency windows, Fano resonances, and slow/fast light in an opto-magnomechanical system through magnon Squeezing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M'bark Amghar, Mohamed Amazioug</p>
            <p>This study presents a theoretical investigation of magnomechanically induced transparency, Fano resonance, and slow/fast light phenomena within a hybrid optomagnomechanical system. The system consists of a mechanical membrane within a cavity and a ferrimagnetic crystal with a magnon squeezing mode that couples directly to a microwave cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction and indirectly to an optical cavity through the crystal's deformation displacement. The optical cavity is influenced by the mechanical displacement, which is driven by magnetostrictive forces through radiation pressure. The interactions among photon, phonons, magnons, and microwave within the cavity give rise to optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) and magnon-induced transparency (MIT). We analyze how the presence of magnon squeezing modifies the absorption and dispersion properties of the optical spectrum. Additionally, the emergence of Fano resonance via photon-phonon coupling in the presence of the magnon squeezing is examined. By tuning the microwave-magnon interactions and the magnon squeezing parameters, we enhance slow/light effects. Our results aim to contribute to the development of quantum information processing technologies.</p>

            <p>Electron--molecule collisions play a central role in both natural processes and modern technological applications, particularly in plasma processing. Conventional computational strategies such as the R-matrix method have been widely adopted yet encounter significant scaling challenges in treating more complex systems.

We explore a number of methods, including the use of number projection operators and simultaneous optimisation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on a model problem of electron scattering from the hydrogen molecule. We recover the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian within a chosen symmetry sector. Moreover, the optimal circuit parameters directly encode the R-matrix boundary amplitudes needed for subsequent scattering computations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaobin Zhao, Hezheng Qin, Hong X. Tang, Linran Fan, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>Photon counting is a fundamental component in quantum optics and quantum information. However, implementing ideal photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors remains experimentally challenging. Multiplexed PNR detection offers a scalable and practical alternative by distributing photons across multiple modes and detecting their presence using simple ON-OFF detectors, thereby enabling approximate photon-number resolution. In this work, we establish a theoretical model for such detectors and prove that the estimation error in terms of photon number moments decreases inverse proportionally to the number of detectors. Thanks to the enhanced PNR capability, multiplexed PNR detector provides an advantage in cat-state breeding protocols. Assuming a two-photon subtraction case, 7dB of squeezing, and an array of 20 detectors of efficiency 95%, our calculation predicts fidelity ~ 0.88 with a success probability ~ 3.8%, representing orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous works. Similar enhancement also extends to cat-state generation with the generalized photon number subtraction. With experimentally feasible parameters, our results suggest that megahertz-rate cat-state generation is achievable using an on-chip array of tens of ON-OFF detectors.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Canceling Quantum Feedback: non-Hermitian Dynamics with Applications to State Preparation and Magic State Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tathagata Karmakar, Philippe Lewalle, Yipei Zhang, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>Time-continuous quantum measurement allows for the tracking of a quantum system in real time via sequences of short, and individually weak, measurement intervals. Such measurements are necessarily invasive, imparting backaction to the system, and allowing the observer to update their state estimate based on stochastic measurement outcomes. Feedback control then involves real-time interventions by an observer, conditioned on the time-continuous measurement signal that they receive. We here consider diffusive quantum trajectories, and focus on the "noise-canceling" subset of feedback protocols that aim to minimize the degree of stochasticity in the dynamics. We derive such a class of feedback operations, showing that under the idealized assumptions of pure states, unit measurement efficiency, and zero time-delay in implementing feedback operations, perfectly noise-canceling feedback always exists. We consider the resulting noise-canceled dynamics generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian; while non-Hermitian Hamiltonians from continuous monitoring generally describe rare dynamics (accessible by costly post-selection), the use of noise-canceling feedback here leads to non-Hermitian dynamics that occur deterministically. We demonstrate this via examples of entangled state preparation and stabilization. We then illustrate the potential for the application of noise-cancellation to boost success rates in magic state distillation protocols. We show that adding feedback based on noise-cancellation into a time-continuous 5-to-1 distillation protocol leads to higher probabilities of successful distillation across a range of input errors, and extends the threshold on input errors for which the protocol is effective. Our results highlight the efficacy of noise-canceling feedback-aided protocols for quantum state preparation and stabilization tasks.</p>

            <p>We report the first experimental demonstration of squeezed lasing in a reservoir-engineered optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO provides a basis of squeezed states and parametric amplification in lasing emission, whose vacuum reservoir is coupled to a squeezed vacuum generated by a second OPO. With a precisely controlled squeezing angle and strong squeezing injection, the parametric interaction in the first OPO is exponentially enhanced. It successfully circumvents the decoherence in the system, and eliminates the undesired noise of spontaneous photon emission in the OPO. As a result, the amplified parametric process simultaneously reserves the coherence and quantum properties in the first OPO, and yields a -6.1 dB squeezed laser in optical domain with a narrow linewidth and high brightness. Our work sheds light on potential applications of squeezed lasing in quantum metrology and quantum optics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum computational advantage of noisy boson sampling with partially distinguishable photons</h2>

            <p>Boson sampling stands out as a promising approach toward experimental demonstration of quantum computational advantage. However, the presence of physical noise in near-term experiments hinders the realization of the quantum computational advantage with boson sampling. Since physical noise in near-term boson sampling devices is inevitable, precise characterization of the boundary of noise rates where the classical intractability of boson sampling is maintained is crucial for quantum computational advantage using near-term devices. In this work, we identify the level of partial distinguishability noise that upholds the classical intractability of boson sampling. We find that boson sampling with on average $O(\log N)$ number of distinguishable photons out of $N$ input photons maintains the equivalent complexity to the ideal boson sampling case. By providing strong complexity theoretical evidence for the classical intractability of noisy boson sampling, we expect that our findings will ultimately facilitate the demonstration of quantum computational advantage with noisy boson sampling experiments in the near future.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyang He, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Adam Wills, Rachel Yun Zhang</p>
            <p>The development of quantum codes with good error correction parameters and useful sets of transversal gates is a problem of major interest in quantum error-correction. Abundant prior works have studied transversal gates which are restricted to acting on all logical qubits simultaneously. In this work, we study codes that support transversal gates which induce $\textit{addressable}$ logical gates, i.e., the logical gates act on logical qubits of our choice. As we consider scaling to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead, addressable logical operations presents an important problem for both theoretical and practical purposes. Our primary result is the construction of an explicit qubit code for which $\textit{any}$ triple of logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks can be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a depth-one circuit of physical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, and whose parameters are asymptotically good, up to polylogarithmic factors. The result naturally generalizes to other gates including the $\mathsf{C}^{\ell} Z$ gates for $\ell \neq 2$. Going beyond this, we develop a formalism for constructing quantum codes with $\textit{addressable and transversal}$ gates. Our framework, called $\textit{addressable orthogonality}$, encompasses the original triorthogonality framework of Bravyi and Haah (Phys. Rev. A 2012), and extends this and other frameworks to study addressable gates. We demonstrate the power of this framework with the construction of an asymptotically good qubit code for which $\textit{pre-designed}$, pairwise disjoint triples of logical qubits within a single codeblock may be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a physical depth-one circuit of $\mathsf{Z}$, $\mathsf{CZ}$ and $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates. In an appendix, we show that our framework extends to addressable and transversal $T$ gates, up to Clifford corrections.</p>

            <p>We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</p>

            <p>Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.</p>

For comparison, we also implement the Dyson-Maleev (DM) encoding for spin-1/2 and show that, in this limit, DM and HP are equivalent. We show the equivalence of the DM and the HP transformations for spin-1/2 systems. Rigorous numerical analyses confirm the effectiveness of our HP-based protocol. Specifically, we obtain the concurrence between the spin dynamics and the behavior of microwave photons within our circuit QED-based analog simulator that is designed for the Bose-Hubbard model. By utilizing the microwave photons inherent to circuit QED devices, our framework presents an accessible, scalable avenue for probing quantum spin dynamics in an experimentally viable setting.</p>

For both cases, we report analytic results as well as quantum jump-based Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the signatures of these single-photon sources on the HOME under different working conditions (for example, strong- and weak-coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics).

            <p>Scalable quantum networks require quantum repeaters to overcome major challenges such as photon loss and decoherence in long-distance quantum communication. In this paper, we present a cavity-magnon quantum repeater architecture that exploits the frequency tunability and coherence characteristics of magnonic platforms to enable efficient entanglement swapping across multi-hop networks. Through comprehensive numerical simulations with realistic experimental parameters, we analyze system performance across diverse deployment scenarios and network scales, examining both short-range and long-distance implementations. We identify critical factors influencing performance and scalability, demonstrating that cavity-magnon systems represent a viable and promising quantum repeater platform with significant integration advantages over existing quantum memory technologies.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Photon Quantum Rabi Models with Center-of-Mass Motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabrina Hartmann, Nicolija Momčilović, Alexander Friedrich</p>
            <p>The precise control of light-matter interaction serves as a cornerstone for diverse quantum technologies, spanning from quantum computing to advanced atom optics. Typical experiments often feature multi-mode fields and require atoms with intricate internal structures to facilitate e.g., multi-photon interactions or cooling. Moreover, the development of high-precision cold-atom sensors necessitates the use of entangled atoms. We introduce a rigorous, second-quantized framework for describing multi-$\Lambda$-atoms in a cavity, encompassing their center-of-mass motion and interaction with a two-mode electromagnetic field. A key feature of our approach is the systematic application of a Hamiltonian averaging theory to the atomic field operators, enabling the derivation of a compact and physically insightful effective Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution. This effective Hamiltonian not only incorporates the AC-Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts, augmented by contributions from all involved ancillary states, but also includes effects from counter-rotating terms, offering a more complete description than conventional RWA-based models. A significant finding is the emergence of a particle-particle interaction mediated by ancillary states, stemming directly from the combined quantum nature of the coupled electromagnetic field and atomic system. We illustrate the practical implications of our model through an analysis of atomic Raman diffraction, determining the time evolution for a typical initial state and demonstrating the resulting Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, our results confirm that both the atomic and optical Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can be observed within this Raman configuration, utilizing a specific two-particle input state, thereby extending the utility of Raman diffraction for quantum interference phenomena and providing a microscopic model of the effect.</p>

            <p>Resonance fluorescence of natural or artificial atoms constitutes a prime method for generating non-classical light. While most efforts have focused on producing single-photons, multi-photon emission is unavoidably present in the resonant driving of an atom. Here, we study the extent to which these processes occur: we quantify the multi-photon emission statistics in a resonantly-driven two-level artificial atom -- a semiconductor quantum dot in a micropillar cavity -- when pumped by short optical pulses. By measuring auto-correlation functions up to the fourth order, we observe up to four photons emitted after a single pumping pulse, and investigate the emission dynamics with finely resolved temporal measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method based on acquisition time gating to enhance the purity of a single-photon source while maintaining high efficiencies. Our results deepen the understanding of the photon emission processes in coherently driven atomic systems, and suggest a simple but effective technique to reduce the multi-photon components of a single-photon source.</p>

            <h2>Gaussian Open Quantum Dynamics and Isomorphism to Superconformal Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ju-Yeon Gyhm, Dario Rosa, Dominik Šafránek</p>
            <p>Understanding the Lie algebraic structure of a physical problem often makes it easier to find its solution. In this paper, we focus on the Lie algebra of Gaussian-conserving superoperators. We construct a Lie algebra of $n$-mode states, $\mathfrak{go}(n)$, composed of all superoperators conserving Gaussianity, and we find it isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2n^2+3n}\oplus_{\mathrm{S}}\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This allows us to solve the quadratic-order Redfield equation for any, even non-Gaussian, state. We find that the algebraic structure of Gaussian operations is the same as that of super-Poincaré algebra in three-dimensional spacetime, where the CPTP condition corresponds to the combination of causality and directionality of time flow. Additionally, we find that a bosonic density matrix satisfies both the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. Finally, we expand the algebra of Gaussian superoperators even further by relaxing the CPTP condition. We find that it is isomorphic to a superconformal algebra, which represents the maximal symmetry of the field theory. This suggests a deeper connection between two seemingly unrelated fields, with the potential to transform problems from one domain into another where they may be more easily solved.</p>

The experiment is based on pulsed frequency bins measured with a multi-output quantum pulse gate, which can perform projective measurements on a complete high-dimensional basis in the time-frequency domain. Our results fit the theoretical predictions: the bound on the sum of the entropies is never violated and is saturated by the states that minimize the uncertainty relations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raúl Morral-Yepes, Marc Langer, Adam Gammon-Smith, Barbara Kraus, Frank Pollmann</p>
            <p>In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Li, Jeremy Upham, Boris Braverman, Robert W. Boyd</p>
            <p>We experimentally demonstrate a violation of local realism with negligible spatial postselection on the polarization-entangled two-photon states produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) pumped by a spatially incoherent light source-a light-emitting diode (LED). While existing studies have observed such a violation only by post-selecting the LED-pumped SPDC into a single spatial detection mode, we achieve a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S = 2.532 \pm 0.069 > 2$ using a spatially multimode detection setup that supports more than 45,000 spatial modes. These results indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for SPDC-based entanglement generation. Our work could enable novel and practical sources of entangled photons for quantum technologies such as device-independent quantum key distribution and quantum-enhanced sensing.</p>

            <p>The last decades have seen the development of quantum machine learning, stemming from the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. This field is particularly promising for the design of alternative quantum (or quantum inspired) computation paradigms that could require fewer resources with respect to standard ones, e.g. in terms of energy consumption. In this context, we present the implementation of a data re-uploading scheme on a photonic integrated processor, achieving high accuracies in several image classification tasks. We thoroughly investigate the capabilities of this apparently simple model, which relies on the evolution of one-qubit states, by providing an analytical proof that our implementation is a universal classifier and an effective learner, capable of generalizing to new, unknown data. Hence, our results not only demonstrate data re-uploading in a potentially resource-efficient optical implementation but also provide new theoretical insight into this algorithm, its trainability, and generalizability properties. This lays the groundwork for developing more resource-efficient machine learning algorithms, leveraging our scheme as a subroutine.</p>

            <p>Optically active spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials have recently emerged as versatile quantum sensors, enabling applications from nanoscale magnetic field detection to the exploration of novel quantum phenomena in condensed matter systems. Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent control of spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium disulfide ($\beta$-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear spin density. The observed spin defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their spin dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the spin coherence time (T$_2$) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate the structure and spin densities of two possible spin defect candidates. This work will help expand the field of quantum sensing with spin defects in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>Europium-doped crystal $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ is an interesting platform for optical quantum memories, due to its long optical and spin coherence times. In this work, we investigate $^{151}\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}\!:\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ under the application of magnetic field, a complex system with 36 different optical-hyperfine transitions. We present a simple numerical simulator for calculating the effect of optical pumping schemes that allow the isolation of a single frequency class of ions, applicable to any multi-level atom with inhomogeneous broadening. Experimentally, we develop methodologies for estimating the magnetic field vector, demonstrating high precision in predicting spectral features based on the known spin Hamiltonians. We measured the optical Rabi frequency of 21 transitions among the 36 possible optical-hyperfine transitions, allowing for the construction of a 6x6 branching ratio matrix of relative transition strengths. From the Rabi frequency measurements, we derive the optical dipole moment for the $^7\!F_0 \leftrightarrow {}^5\!D_0$ transition, yielding a value of $(6.94 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{-33}~\mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m}$.

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising direction in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, offering computational and memory advantages by harnessing superposition and entanglement. However, QML models often face challenges in scalability and expressiveness due to hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose quantum mixture of experts (QMoE), a novel quantum architecture that integrates the mixture of experts (MoE) paradigm into the QML setting. QMoE comprises multiple parameterized quantum circuits serving as expert models, along with a learnable quantum routing mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input. The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks demonstrate that it consistently outperforms standard quantum neural networks, highlighting its effectiveness in learning complex data patterns. Our work paves the way for scalable and interpretable quantum learning frameworks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Burri</p>
            <p>The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information (PRMI) of order $\alpha$ is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite quantum state $\rho_{AB}$ relative to any product state $\sigma_A\otimes \tau_B$. To date, no closed-form expression for this measure has been found, necessitating the development of numerical methods for its computation. In this work, we show that alternating minimization over $\sigma_A$ and $\tau_B$ asymptotically converges to the doubly minimized PRMI for any $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)\cup (1,2]$, by proving linear convergence of the objective function values with respect to the number of iterations for $\alpha\in (1,2]$ and sublinear convergence for $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$. Previous studies have only addressed the specific case where $\rho_{AB}$ is a classical-classical state, while our results hold for any quantum state $\rho_{AB}$.</p>

            <h2>Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiffany Duneau</p>
            <p>The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting. Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact with one another, we explain how the model behaves.</p>

            <h2>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessica Kaijia Jiang, Federica Maria Surace, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-André models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-André models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</p>

            <p>An excess density of quasiparticles is widely observed in superconducting films. This excess causes performance degradation in a variety of superconducting devices, including decoherence in qubits. In this Letter, we evaluate the hypothesis of [1] that the quasiparticle excess is caused by anomalously slow recombination at low quasiparticle densities due to localization in sub-gap states. We probe the density of states in aluminum and niobium films using current-voltage measurements of tunnel junctions and extract upper bounds on the energy scales of the sub-gap states and gap smearing. With these parameters, we evaluate the recombination times predicted by [1] and find that slow recombination is not predicted to occur at observed quasiparticle densities in aluminumand niobium-based superconducting devices. These results suggest that the quasiparticle excess in ordered superconductors is primarily due to non-thermal sources of quasiparticle generation and not slow recombination.</p>

            <p>Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco J. Herranz, Danilo Latini</p>
            <p>This work aims to bridge the gap between Dunkl superintegrable systems and the coalgebra symmetry approach to superintegrability, and subsequently to recover known models and construct new ones. In particular, an infinite family of $N$-dimensional quasi-maximally superintegrable quantum systems with reflections, sharing the same set of $2N-3$ quantum integrals, is introduced. The result is achieved by introducing a novel differential-difference realization of $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ and then applying the coalgebra formalism. Several well-known maximally superintegrable models with reflections appear as particular cases of this general family, among them, the celebrated Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system. Furthermore, restricting to the case of "hidden" quantum quadratic symmetries, maximally superintegrable curved oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians of Dunkl type, sharing the same underlying $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ coalgebra symmetry, are presented. Namely, the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on the $N$-sphere and hyperbolic space together with two models which can be interpreted as a one-parameter superintegrable deformation of the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on non-constant curvature spaces. In addition, maximally superintegrable generalizations of these models, involving non-central potentials, are also derived on flat and curved spaces. For all specific systems, at least an additional quantum integral is explicitly provided, which is related to the Dunkl version of a (curved) Demkov-Fradkin tensor or a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector.</p>

As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Miloschewsky, Supartha Podder</p>
            <p>In 2004, Aaronson introduced the complexity class $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ ($\mathsf{BQP}$ with postselection) and showed that it is equal to $\mathsf{PP}$. In this paper, we define a new complexity class, $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$, a modification of $\mathsf{BQP}$ which has the power to perform correlated measurements, i.e. measurements that output the same value across a partition of registers. We show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is exactly equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$, placing it "just above" $\mathsf{PP}$. In fact, we show that other metaphysical modifications of $\mathsf{BQP}$, such as $\mathsf{CBQP}$ (i.e. $\mathsf{BQP}$ with the ability to clone arbitrary quantum states), are also equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is self-low with respect to classical queries. In contrast, if it were self-low under quantum queries, the counting hierarchy ($\mathsf{CH}$) would collapse to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Finally, we introduce a variant of rational degree that lower-bounds the query complexity of $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.</p>

            <h2>Domain-wall melting and entanglement in free-fermion chains with a band structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktor Eisler</p>
            <p>We study the melting of a domain wall in free-fermion chains, where the periodic variation of the hopping amplitudes gives rise to a band structure. It is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuyang Guo, Kirk W. Madison, James L. Booth, Roman V. Krems</p>
            <p>Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</p>

            <p>Radiative nonlinear four-wave mixing can monitor the evolution of electronic wave packets, providing access to lifetimes and quantifies the light induced couplings between excited states. We report the observation of quantum beats in an autoionizing electronic wavepacket in krypton, probed using this technique. Analysis of the signal reveals that these beats originate from the contribution of previously unassigned, doubly excited states interacting with singly excited ones. We introduce a minimal theoretical model, based on multichannel quantum defect theory, that quantitatively reproduces both the wavepacket dynamics and the static spectrum. This work combines a versatile, background-free experimental scheme with a tractable model, establishing a powerful approach for the metrology and control of complex, correlated electronic states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuaishuai Tong, Qicheng Zhang, Gaohan Li, Kun Zhang, Chun Xie, Chunyin Qiu</p>
            <p>Momentum-band topology, which transcends conventional topological band theory, unlocks new topological phases that host fascinating temporal interface states. However, direct bulk experimental evidence of such emerging band topology is still lacking due to the great challenges in resolving eigenstates and topological invariants of time-varying systems. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the momentum-band topology in a PT-symmetric Floquet lattice, where the drive-induced momentum gap can be characterized by a quantized Berry phase in the energy Brillouin zone. Experimentally, we synthesize the Floquet lattice model using an acoustic cavity-tube structure coupled to custom-designed external circuits. By reconstructing the effective Hamiltonian, we extract the system's eigenstates and provide the first bulk evidence of momentum-band topology from the perspectives of band inversion and topological invariants. This is accompanied by an unambiguous observation of time-localized interface states in real physical time, thereby providing the boundary signature of the bulk topology. Our work paves the way for further experimental studies on the burgeoning momentum-gap physics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and Förster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. I. Dykman, J. Pollanen</p>
            <p>Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons -- affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalie Love, István A. Kovács</p>
            <p>Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The inverse Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system, initially in thermal equilibrium and prepared at different temperatures below that of the final equilibrium state, relaxes to the final state more rapidly when starting from a lower initial temperature. We extend this concept to the relaxation toward a prethermal state in isolated quantum systems. By examining a simple model that exhibits prethermalization, we demonstrate that this effect indeed manifests under periodic driving. We further discuss the realization of this phenomenon in a variety of systems within a unified theoretical framework.</p>

            <p>We compute the entropy-per-particle, $S/N$, produced by the decoherence of a coherent state interacting with an environment, using an analytical open quantum system approach. The coherent state considered is characterized by occupation numbers borrowed from the glasma fields produced in the early stages of high-energy nuclear collisions. The environment is modeled as the vacuum, and decoherence arises from the interaction of the state with vacuum fluctuations. We describe the system-environment interaction via a phase-damping model, which represents continuous measurements on the system without altering its energy or particle number. Starting from the occupation numbers typical of the Glasma in high-energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, we find that the final $S/N$ after decoherence is lower than that of a two-dimensional thermal bath of ultrarelativistic gluons, except for proton-nucleus collisions at small values of $g\mu$. Our results indicate that quantum decoherence alone does not generate sufficient entropy to transform the initial coherent state into a thermalized gluon bath.</p>

            <h2>Dual frequency calibration to build a portable vapor cell optical clock with improved stability and without a frequency comb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreeshna Subhash, Greeshma Gopinath, Sankar Davuluri</p>
            <p>This article theoretically proposes a new dual interferometer technique to accurately calibrate two laser frequencies simultaneously using four-wave mixing in an alkali metal vapor cell. The two frequency-calibrated lasers are mixed to create a beat signal at radio frequency to build a portable optical atomic clock (OAC) without an optical frequency comb (OFC). Removal of the OFC improves the portability of OAC, while the dual interferometer setup enhances the one second stability to $1.3\times 10^{-15}$, which is better than the current portable OAC. Thermal noise in the OAC is minimized by choosing the double-lambda atomic scheme with co-propagating laser fields. Using D2 transition of Rb-87, the standard quantum limited frequency sensitivity and stability of the OAC are estimated as $3.2\;\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$, and $1.3\times10^{-15}\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}^{-1}}$, respectively. After considering broadening effects due to $357\,$K temperature and collisions, the optimum stability of the OAC is reduced to $3.3\times10^{-15}\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}^{-1}}$ for a laser with $1\,$KHz linewidth and $0.54$ mW power at the input of the vapor cell.</p>

Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</p>

The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>We introduce a mesoscopic quantum well whose confinement and chirality emerge solely from the intrinsic torsion of a finite helicoidal metric. This purely geometric construction requires no external gates or fields: the metric itself induces both a harmonic radial potential and a torsion-driven Zeeman term that breaks the $m \leftrightarrow -m$ degeneracy. By imposing hard-wall boundary conditions at $z = \pm L/2$, we quantize the axial motion and obtain a genuinely zero-dimensional helicoidal quantum dot. An exact analytic solution reveals an energy spectrum with chiral splitting linear in both the torsion parameter $\Omega$ and the axial quantum number $n_z$. For realistic InAs nanoroll parameters ($L = 100$ nm, $\Omega = 5\times10^{6} \mathrm{m^{-1}}$), this geometric effect results in a measurable splitting of $\sim 0.5$ meV. We propose three viable experimental platforms, ultracold atoms in optical traps, femtosecond-written photonic waveguides, and strain-engineered semiconductor nanorolls, where this torsion-induced phenomenon should be accessible with current technology.</p>

            <p>We present a dequantization algorithm for the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) system, termed the dequantized particle algorithm, by systematically dequantizing the underlying many-body quantum theory. Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schrödinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</p>

            <p>The presence of low-energy valley excitations in Si/SiGe heterostructures often causes spin qubits to fail. It is therefore important to develop robust protocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that realistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to dramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that knowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can significantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum well using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in this procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the valley phase winds by $\pm 2\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This proposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can be implemented in current experiments.</p>

We show that the tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly compressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential operators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations required for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method is demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient flows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers, forces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in terms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential runtime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We find accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions by a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up to 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical evidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach with system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating larger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid flow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum computer leading to further scaling advantages.</p>

            <p>The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations effectively convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity can be rendered consistent by assuming that quantum systems only emit a gravitational field when they interact with a stable determination chain (SDCs), which are specific chains of interactions modeled via decoherence and test functions obeying a set of conditions. When systems are disconnected from SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field. This denies the universality of gravity, while upholding a version of the equivalence principle. We argue that this theory can be tested by experiments that investigate the gravitational field emitted by isolated systems like in gravcats experiments or by investigating the gravitational interactions between entangled systems like in the (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) BMV experiment. Our theory fits into a new framework which holds that in the absence of certain conditions, quantum systems cannot emit a gravitational field. There are many possible conditions for systems to emit a gravitational field, and we will adopt a subset of them. We will show how this subset of conditions provides multiple benefits beyond rendering semiclassical gravity consistent, which includes deriving the value of the cosmological constant from first principles and providing an explanation for why the vacuum does not gravitate.</p>

This paper proposes a decision diagram style data structure, called TDD (Tensor Decision Diagram), for more principled and convenient applications of tensor networks. This new data structure provides a compact and canonical representation for quantum circuits. By exploiting circuit partition, the TDD of a quantum circuit can be computed efficiently. Furthermore, we show that the operations of tensor networks essential in their applications (e.g., addition and contraction), can also be implemented efficiently in TDDs. A proof-of-concept implementation of TDDs is presented and its efficiency is evaluated on a set of benchmark quantum circuits. It is expected that TDDs will play an important role in various design automation tasks related to quantum circuits, including but not limited to equivalence checking, error detection, synthesis, simulation, and verification.</p>

            <h2>Optical protection of alkali-metal atoms from spin relaxation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avraham Berrebi, Mark Dikopoltsev, Ori Katz, Or Katz</p>
            <p>We present an optical technique for suppressing relaxation in alkali-metal spins using a single off-resonant laser beam. The method harnesses a physical mechanism that synchronizes Larmor precession in the two hyperfine manifolds, protecting magnetic coherence from relaxation caused by spin-exchange and other hyperfine-changing collisions. We experimentally demonstrate up to a ninefold reduction in decoherence of warm cesium vapor, achieving simultaneous protection from both spin-exchange relaxation and partial depolarization from coated cell walls. The technique substantially enhances the spin precession quality factor and maintains a stable gyromagnetic ratio independent of spin polarization, even under frequent collisions. These findings offer a pathway for mitigating dominant relaxation channels in alkali-metal-based applications and experiments, particularly in anti-relaxation-coated cells.</p>

            <p>We propose to characterize multipartite entanglement of pure states as local unitary transformations acting on some parts of a system that can be undone by local unitary transformations acting on other parts. This leads to a definition of multipartite entanglement in terms of entanglement groups, constructed as certain quotients of the stabilizer group and its subgroups. We analyze properties of these entanglement groups and show that they imply restrictions which correspond to monogamy of entanglement. We use these groups to propose a coarse-grained classification scheme for entanglement in multi-partite quantum systems and we show that this group theory characterization of entanglement underlies several well-known quantum tasks.</p>

            <h2>Bounds on Autonomous Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oles Shtanko, Yu-Jie Liu, Simon Lieu, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Victor V. Albert</p>
            <p>Autonomous quantum memories are a way to passively protect quantum information using engineered dissipation that creates an ``always-on'' decoder. We analyze Markovian autonomous decoders that can be implemented with a wide range of qubit and bosonic error-correcting codes, and derive several upper bounds and a lower bound on the logical error rate in terms of correction and noise rates. These bounds suggest that, in general, there is always a correction rate, possibly size-dependent, above which autonomous memories exhibit arbitrarily long coherence times. For any given autonomous memory, size dependence of this correction rate is difficult to rule out: we point to common scenarios where autonomous decoders that stochastically implement active error correction must operate at rates that grow with code size. For codes with a threshold, we show that it is possible to achieve faster-than-polynomial decay of the logical error rate with code size by using superlogarithmic scaling of the correction rate. We illustrate our results with several examples. One example is an exactly solvable global dissipative toric code model that can achieve an effective logical error rate that decreases exponentially with the linear lattice size, provided that the recovery rate grows proportionally with the linear lattice size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Li, Jamir Marino, Darrick E. Chang, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>While traditionally regarded as an obstacle to quantum coherence, recent breakthroughs in quantum optics have shown that the dissipative interaction of a qubit with its environment can be leveraged to protect quantum states and synthesize many-body entanglement. Inspired by this progress, here we set the stage for the -- yet uncharted -- exploration of analogous cooperative phenomena in hybrid solid-state platforms. We develop a comprehensive formalism for the quantum many-body dynamics of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects interacting with the magnetic field fluctuations of a common solid-state reservoir. Our framework applies to any solid-state reservoir whose fluctuating spin, pseudospin, or charge degrees of freedom generate magnetic fields. To understand whether correlations induced by dissipative processes can play a relevant role in a realistic experimental setup, we apply our model to a qubit array interacting via the spin fluctuations of a ferromagnetic bath. Our results show that the low-temperature collective relaxation rates of the qubit ensemble can display clear signatures of super- and subradiance, i.e., forms of cooperative dynamics traditionally achieved in atomic ensembles. We find that the solid-state analog of these cooperative phenomena is robust against spatial disorder in the qubit ensemble and thermal fluctuations of the magnetic reservoir, providing a route for their feasibility in near-term experiments. Our work lays the foundation for a multi-qubit approach to quantum sensing of solid-state systems and the direct generation of many-body entanglement in spin-defect ensembles. Furthermore, we discuss how the tunability of solid-state reservoirs opens up novel pathways for exploring cooperative phenomena in regimes beyond the reach of conventional quantum optics setups.</p>

            <h2>Learning unitaries with quantum statistical queries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armando Angrisani</p>
            <p>We propose several algorithms for learning unitary operators from quantum statistical queries with respect to their Choi-Jamiolkowski state. Quantum statistical queries capture the capabilities of a learner with limited quantum resources, which receives as input only noisy estimates of expected values of measurements. Our approach leverages quantum statistical queries to estimate the Fourier mass of a unitary on a subset of Pauli strings, generalizing previous techniques developed for uniform quantum examples. Specifically, we show that the celebrated quantum Goldreich-Levin algorithm can be implemented with quantum statistical queries, whereas the prior version of the algorithm involves oracle access to the unitary and its inverse. As an application, we prove that quantum Boolean functions with constant total influence or with constant degree are efficiently learnable in our model. Moreover, we prove that $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-juntas are efficiently learnable and constant-depth circuits are learnable query-efficiently with quantum statistical queries. On the other hand, all previous algorithms for these tasks demand significantly greater resources, such as oracle access to the unitary or direct access to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. We also demonstrate that, despite these positive results, quantum statistical queries lead to an exponentially larger query complexity for certain tasks, compared to separable measurements to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. In particular, we show an exponential lower bound for learning a class of phase-oracle unitaries and a double exponential lower bound for testing the unitarity of channels. Taken together, our results indicate that quantum statistical queries offer a unified framework for various unitary learning tasks, with potential applications in quantum machine learning, many-body physics and benchmarking of near-term devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry Buhrman, Jonas Helsen, Jordi Weggemans</p>
            <p>We define a general formulation of quantum PCPs, which captures adaptivity and multiple unentangled provers, and give a detailed construction of the quantum reduction to a local Hamiltonian with a constant promise gap. The reduction turns out to be a versatile subroutine to prove properties of quantum PCPs, allowing us to show: (i) Non-adaptive quantum PCPs can simulate adaptive quantum PCPs when the number of proof queries is constant. In fact, this can even be shown to hold when the non-adaptive quantum PCP picks the proof indices simply uniformly at random from a subset of all possible index combinations, answering an open question by Aharonov, Arad, Landau and Vazirani (STOC '09). (ii) If the $q$-local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap can be solved in $\mathsf{QCMA}$, then $\mathsf{QPCP}[q] \subseteq \mathsf{QCMA}$ for any $q \in O(1)$. (iii) If $\mathsf{QMA}(k)$ has a quantum PCP for any $k \leq \text{poly}(n)$, then $\mathsf{QMA}(2) = \mathsf{QMA}$, connecting two of the longest-standing open problems in quantum complexity theory. Moreover, we also show that there exist (quantum) oracles relative to which certain quantum PCP statements are false. Hence, any attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture requires, just as was the case for the classical PCP theorem, (quantumly) non-relativizing techniques.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that, for any fixed dimension, our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\mathtt{tol}$ with an optimal complexity of order $\mathtt{tol}^{-1}$ up to logarithmic terms, significantly improving over existing approaches. Notably, this approach does not rely on regularity of the solution and achieves quantum advantage over classical solvers in two dimensions, whereas prior quantum methods required at least four dimensions for asymptotic benefits. We further detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, present simulator results, and report numerical experiments on current quantum hardware, confirming the feasibility of preconditioned finite element methods for near-term quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits can be sensitive to abrupt energy deposits caused by cosmic rays and ambient radioactivity. While previous studies have explored correlated effects in time and space due to cosmic ray interactions, we present the first direct comparison of a transmon qubit's performance measured at two distinct sites: the above-ground SQMS facility (Fermilab, US) and the deep-underground Gran Sasso Laboratory (Italy). Despite the stark difference in radiation levels, we observe a similar average qubit relaxation time of approximately 80 microseconds at both locations. To further investigate potential radiation-induced events, we employ a fast decay detection protocol, comparing the relative rates of triggered events between the two environments. Although intrinsic noise remains the dominant source of single errors in superconducting qubits, our analysis revealed a significant excess of radiation-induced events for high-coherence transmon qubits operated above-ground. Finally, using $\gamma$-ray sources with increasing activity levels, we evaluate the qubit response in a controlled low-background environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Manshouri, Moslem Zarei, Mehdi Abdi, Sougato Bose, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</p>

            <h2>Coherent information for CSS codes under decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Niwa, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.</p>

Generalizing the idea behind Pauli tableaux, we introduce a type system and lambda calculus for projective Cliffords called LambdaPC, which captures well-formed Clifford operations via a Curry-Howard correspondence with a particular encoding of the Clifford and Pauli groups. Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p>

            <p>A cryptographic compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers and complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>We investigate asymmetric steering harvesting phenomenon involving two non-identical inertial detectors with different energy gaps, which interact locally with vacuum massless scalar fields. Our study assumes that the energy gap of detector $B$ exceeds that of detector $A$. It is shown that $A\rightarrow B$ steerability is bigger that $B\rightarrow A$ steerability, implying that the observer with a small energy gap has more stronger steerability than the other one. We find that the energy gap difference can enlarge the harvesting-achievable range of $A\rightarrow B$ steering, while it can also narrow the harvesting-achievable range of $B\rightarrow A$ steering at the same time. In addition, the maximal steering asymmetry indicates the transformation between two-way steering and one-way steering in some cases, showing that $B\rightarrow A$ steering suffers ``sudden death" at the point of this parameter. These results suggest that asymmetric steering exhibits richer and more interesting properties than quantum entanglement harvested from vacuum quantum field.</p>

This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights from our proofs, we identify both sufficient and necessary complexity-theoretic assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up. We consider both the worst-case setting, where accurate results are required for all inputs, and the average-case setting.</p>

Rather, they arise from symmetry relations in low-lying excited states. Despite their stability within a 'phase', practical realization of stable qubits is hindered by susceptibility to symmetry-breaking perturbations. This work highlights that there can be non-trivial quantum behavior in the thermal dynamics of noncommuting many body models, and opens the door to more extensive studies of self-correction in such systems.</p>

            <p>We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</p>

            <p>Quantum repeaters are an essential building block for realizing long-distance quantum communications. However, due to the fragile nature of quantum information, these repeaters suffer from loss and operational errors. Prior works have classified repeaters into three broad categories based on their use of probabilistic or near-deterministic methods to mitigate these errors. Besides differences in classical communication times, these approaches also vary in technological complexity, with near-deterministic methods requiring more advanced technology. Recent increases in the number of available memories, and introduction of entanglement generation through multiplexing motivate a re-comparison of one-way and two-way repeater architectures. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that optimizes multiplexed elementary link generation and distillation in memory-unconstrained 'connection-oriented' two-way repeaters to boost the entanglement generation rates. We introduce a recursive formulation to derive the probability distribution of the number of Bell pairs in multiplexed two-way repeater architectures, compatible with probabilistic $n$-to-$k$ distillation protocols. We then compare the performance of this new protocol with one-way schemes in the parameter regime where one-way schemes have previously been shown to be advantageous, and find that the multiplexed two-way protocol provides better performance with lower resource and technology requirements.</p>

            <p>Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field of research with potential applications to distributed collaborative learning, such as Split Learning (SL). SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL), an application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. Additionally, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Evaluations on real hardware demonstrate HQSL's practicality under realistic quantum noise. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to train collaboratively with a hybrid quantum server, improving model performance and resistance against reconstruction attacks.</p>

            <p>In the realm of quantum information processing, the efficient characterization of entangled states poses an overwhelming challenge, rendering the traditional methods including quantum tomography unfeasible and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a new verification scheme using collective strategies, showcasing arbitrarily high efficiency that beats the optimal verification with global measurements. Our collective scheme can be implemented in various experimental platforms and scalable for large systems with a linear scaling on hardware requirement, and distributed operations are allowed. Notably, larger ensembles can always improve the efficiency further, but without increasing the quantum memory. More importantly, the approach consumes only a few copies of the entangled states, while ensuring the preservation of unmeasured ones, and even boosting their fidelity for any subsequent tasks. Furthermore, our protocol provides additional insight into the specific types of noise affecting the system, thereby facilitating potential targeted improvements. These advancements hold promise for a wide range of applications, offering a pathway towards more robust and efficient quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, Rényi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.</p>

            <h2>Phenomenological quantum mechanics I: phenomenology of quantum observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piotr Szańkowski, Davide Lonigro, Fattah Sakuldee, Łukasz Cywiński, Dariusz Chruściński</p>
            <p>We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.</p>

            <h2>The multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality and the squashed entanglement of the multimode extreme bosonic Gaussian channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Falco, Giacomo De Palma</p>
            <p>We prove the multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality for bosonic quantum systems. This inequality determines the minimum conditional von Neumann entropy of the output of the most general linear mixing of bosonic quantum modes among all the input states of the modes with given conditional entropies. Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime, which provides the most promising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution. We apply our multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality to determine new lower bounds to the squashed entanglement of a large family of bosonic Gaussian states. The squashed entanglement is one of the main entanglement measures in quantum communication theory, providing the best known upper bound to the distillable key. Exploiting this result, we determine a new lower bound to the squashed entanglement of the multimode bosonic Gaussian channels that are extreme, i.e., that cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial convex combination of quantum channels. The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel provides an upper bound to its secret-key capacity, i.e., the capacity to generate a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver. Lower bounds to the squashed entanglement are notoriously hard to prove. Our results contribute to break this barrier and will stimulate further research in the field of quantum communication with bosonic quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Classical Algorithms for Constant Approximation of the Ground State Energy of Local Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> François Le Gall</p>
            <p>We construct classical algorithms computing an approximation of the ground state energy of an arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonian acting on $n$ qubits. We first consider the setting where a good ``guiding state'' is available, which is the main setting where quantum algorithms are expected to achieve an exponential speedup over classical methods. We show that a constant approximation (i.e., an approximation with constant relative accuracy) of the ground state energy can be computed classically in $\mathrm{poly}\left(1/\chi,n\right)$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space, where $\chi$ denotes the overlap between the guiding state and the ground state (as in prior works in dequantization, we assume sample-and-query access to the guiding state). This gives a significant improvement over the recent classical algorithm by Gharibian and Le Gall (SICOMP 2023), and matches (up a to polynomial overhead) both the time and space complexities of quantum algorithms for constant approximation of the ground state energy. We also obtain classical algorithms for higher-precision approximation. For the setting where no guided state is given (i.e., the standard version of the local Hamiltonian problem), we obtain a classical algorithm computing a constant approximation of the ground state energy in $2^{O(n)}$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space. To our knowledge, before this work it was unknown how to classically achieve these bounds simultaneously, even for constant approximation. We also discuss complexity-theoretic aspects of our results.</p>

            <p>A distributed quantum computing network requires a quantum communication channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting circuits, such a channel can be implemented based on propagating microwave photons to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver. However, traveling microwave photons can be lost during the transmission, leading to the failure of information transfer. Heralding protocols can be used to detect such photon losses. In this work, we propose such a protocol and experimentally demonstrate a frequency-bin encoding method of microwave photonic modes using superconducting circuits. We deterministically encode the quantum information from a superconducting qubit by simultaneously emitting its information into two photonic modes at different frequencies, with a process fidelity of 90.4%. The frequency-bin-encoded photonic modes can be used, at the receiver processor, to detect the occurrence of photon loss. Our work thus provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer in a distributed quantum computing network, incorporating error detection to enhance performance and accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Braida, Shantanav Chakraborty, Alapan Chaudhuri, Joseph Cunningham, Rutvij Menavlikar, Leonardo Novo, Jérémie Roland</p>
            <p>In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</p>

            <p>We consider different schemes for the electrodynamic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect introduced in Ref. [Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{108}$, 062218 (2023)], exploring the phenomenon to enhance the understanding of its topological nature in spacetime. In the treated examples, the electric current in a solenoid varies in time, changing its internal magnetic field and producing an external electric field, while a quantum charged particle is in a superposition state inside two Faraday cages in an interferometer. The Faraday cages cancel the electric field at their interiors, such that the particle is always subjected to null electromagnetic fields. We discuss how the AB phase difference depends on the topology of the electric and magnetic fields in spacetime in the different treated situations. In particular, we discuss interesting results when a conducting wire connects the two Faraday cages, with the AB phase depending on the wire position. We also show an amplification of the AB phase when the wire makes several turns around the solenoid, which could enable an experimental verification of the effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyuan Chen, Yuanjie Ren, Ruihua Fan, Arthur Jaffe</p>
            <p>One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Learning Feedback Mechanisms for Measurement-Based Variational Quantum State Preparation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Alcalde Puente, Matteo Rizzi</p>
            <p>This work introduces a self-learning protocol that incorporates measurement and feedback into variational quantum circuits for efficient quantum state preparation. By combining projective measurements with conditional feedback, the protocol learns state preparation strategies that extend beyond unitary-only methods, leveraging measurement-based shortcuts to reduce circuit depth. Using the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state as a benchmark, the protocol learns high-fidelity state preparation by overcoming a family of measurement induced local minima through adjustments of parameter update frequencies and ancilla regularization. Despite these efforts, optimization remains challenging due to the highly non-convex landscapes inherent to variational circuits. The approach is extended to larger systems using translationally invariant ansätze and recurrent neural networks for feedback, demonstrating scalability. Additionally, the successful preparation of a specific AKLT state with desired edge modes highlights the potential to discover new state preparation protocols where none currently exist. These results indicate that integrating measurement and feedback into variational quantum algorithms provides a promising framework for quantum state preparation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the inseparability of states generated by superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a product state. In particular, we identify specific multipartite entangled states that will always produce inseparability after superposition with an arbitrary completely product state. Thus, these entangled states are unconditionally superposition-robust, and we refer to this phenomenon as ``unconditional inseparability of superposition" in multipartite quantum systems. In this way, we complete the picture of unconditional inseparability of superposition which was introduced earlier for bipartite systems. We also characterize the superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a pure bi-separable state. However, the present analysis allows us to obtain a more general result, viz., there exists at least one pure entangled state in any multipartite Hilbert space such that its superposition with an arbitrary completely product state always yields an entangled state. On the other hand, for any bipartite pure entangled state, if at least one of the subsystems is a qubit, then it is always possible to find a suitable product state such that the superposition of the entangled state and the product state produces a product state. In this way, we find a feature of multipartite quantum systems which is in sharp contrast with that of bipartite ones. We then show how unconditional inseparability of superposition can be useful in exhibiting an indistinguishability property within the local unambiguous state discrimination problem.</p>

            <p>In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,\hat{\bf z}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a \textit{perturbation}. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor $\big(1 - \big(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\big)^\nu\big)$, $\nu \geq 1$, appears to represent a significant improvement compared to the non-variational cut-off factors commonly employed in the literature. The dependence of the total energy $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ and the binding energy $E_b=E_b(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,$a.u. and the magnetic field strength $B\in [0.0,\,1.0]\,$a.u. is presented in detail. The expectation values $\langle \rho \rangle$ and $\langle|z| \rangle$, and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization. A brief discussion is provided comparing the 2D and 3D cases as well.</p>

            <p>Nonlocal characteristics of a two-qubit gate are determined by its nonlocal part. The squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of a two-qubit gate exist on the unit circle in the complex plane. We show that two sets of chords, the chords connecting the squared eigenvalues with each other and those connecting a squared eigenvalue with the complex conjugate of others in the unit circle, can be used to describe the nonlocal characteristics of two-qubit gates. Lengths of both sets of chords are proportional to the amount of entanglement contained in certain pure states. The entangling power of a two-qubit gate can be expressed in terms of the squared lengths of the first set of chords. Similarly, we show that the gate typicality of a two-qubit gate can be expressed in terms of the squared lengths of the second set of chords and the linear entropy of a two-qubit gate can be expressed using the squared lengths of both sets of chords. Perfect entanglers are known to transform some product states into maximally entangled states. The convex hull of the squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers contain the zero. We analyse the simplices containing the zero in the convex hull of the squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers to construct a pair of orthonormal product states that can be transformed into maximally entangled states by the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers and divide the region of perfect entanglers in the Weyl chamber into three tetrahedral regions and eight bounding planes based on the uniqueness of the simplices containing the zero.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Medina-Guerra, I. V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</p>

The effects of the hopping interaction between the two-level ions and the coupling interaction between the ions and the external mechanical oscillator on the charging process of the battery are investigated. The importance of the counter-rotating wave terms in the system's Hamiltonian, which are often ignored, is analyzed, and it is found that the charging energy and the ergotropy of the battery are dramatically affected by the counter-rotating wave terms. The quantum phase transition of the two-level system is restrained by the counter-rotating wave terms due to the destruction of the quantum coherence. Lastly, the power-law dependence of the charging process on the distance between the ions is discussed. Our theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the development of a practical quantum battery.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the complex nonlinear dynamics of an optomechanical system featuring an optical cavity coupled to two mechanical resonators interconnected by a phase-dependent interaction. We specifically explore the role of this phase-dependent phonon hopping as a mechanism for generating synthetic gauge fields without relying on gain-loss or PT-symmetric elements, offering a potentially more robust approach to manipulate mechanical energy transfer. By deriving the semiclassical dynamical equations, we map out the system's behavior across different parameter regimes. Our findings reveal a rich spectrum of dynamics, including bistability (coexistence of two steady states) and the emergence of complex attractors such as self-excited oscillations, hidden attractors, and chaos. We demonstrate how controlling system parameters, particularly the mechanical coupling phase and optical drive, allows for tunability between these distinct dynamical states. The presence of tunable bistability and sensitive chaotic regimes offers significant potential for practical applications. Specifically, we discuss how these controlled dynamics could be leveraged for state-switching in optical information processing and for enhancing sensitivity in advanced sensor technologies through chaos-based mechanisms. This work deepens our understanding of how synthetic gauge fields, generated via phase-dependent interactions, can sculpt the nonlinear dynamics of optomechanical systems, providing a pathway toward designing robust and tunable devices for signal processing, communication, and sensing.</p>

            <p>We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</p>

            <p>Accurate assessment and management of errors is indispensable for extracting useful results from noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose the qubit error probability (QEP), a device specific metric that combines relaxation, dephasing, gate, and measurement contributions into a single per qubit figure of merit computable before execution. Leveraging QEP as the control variable, we revisit zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) by adding pairs of controlled native two-qubit gates on all connected qubit pairs to generate circuits with successively larger mean QEP; the zero error limit is then approximated by a linear regression of the measured observable against those values. Benchmarking on IBM Quantum Heron processors, we apply QEP guided ZNE to first order Trotterized simulations of the two dimensional transverse field Ising model, chosen as a representative interacting many body system, involving up to 68 qubits and 15 Trotter steps. In regimes where the raw circuits exhibit a finite mean QEP, the method suppresses observable errors beyond those attainable with circuit depth scaled ZNE, while requiring only three noise scaled evaluations and no additional classical post processing. These results demonstrate that QEP serves as a transparent and efficient error metric, and that its integration into ZNE provides a practical route to reliability gains on current superconducting hardware, without the resource costs associated with full quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>$\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers offer a promising route to tackling problems that are classically intractable such as in prime-factorization, solving large-scale linear algebra and simulating complex quantum systems, but potentially require fault-tolerant quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for leveraging near-term quantum computers to solve complex problems. However, there remain major challenges in their trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training methods that combine an existing classical-enhanced g-sim method and the quantum-based Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically evaluate our approach for ground-state estimation of 6 to 18-qubit Hamiltonians using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and quantum phase classification for up to 12-qubit Hamiltonians using quantum neural networks. For VQE, our method achieves higher accuracy and success rates, with an average reduction in quantum hardware calls of up to 60% compared to purely quantum-based PSR. For classification, we observe test accuracy improvements of up to 2.8%. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</p>

            <h2>Quantum advantage from negativity of work quasiprobability distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Francica</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries can be charged by performing a work ``instantaneously'' if there is a large number of cells. In general, the work exhibits statistics that can be represented by a quasiprobability in the presence of initial quantum coherence in the energy basis. Here we show that these two concepts of quantum thermodynamics, which apparently appear disconnected, show a simple relation. Specifically, if the work distribution shows negativity in some time interval, then we can surely get quantum advantage in the charging process.</p>

            <h2>Selective and efficient quantum state tomography for multi-qubit systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniket Patel, Akshay Gaikwad, Tangyou Huang, Anton Frisk Kockum, Tahereh Abad</p>
            <p>Quantum state tomography (QST) is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states. However, QST becomes impractical for reconstructing multi-qubit density matrices since data sets and computational costs grow exponentially with qubit number. In this Letter, we introduce selective and efficient QST (SEEQST), an approach for efficiently estimating multiple selected elements of an arbitrary $N$-qubit density matrix. We show that any $N$-qubit density matrix can be partitioned into $2^N$ subsets, each containing $2^N$ elements. With SEEQST, any such subset can be accurately estimated from just two experiments with only single-qubit measurements. The complexity for estimating any subset remains constant regardless of Hilbert-space dimension, so SEEQST can find the full density matrix using $2^{N+1} - 1$ experiments, where standard methods would use $3^N$ experiments. We provide a circuit decomposition for the SEEQST experiments, demonstrating that their maximum circuit depth scales logarithmically with $N$ assuming all-to-all connectivity. The Python code for SEEQST is publicly available at \href{this https URL}{this http URL}.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Doeblin Coefficients: Interpretations and Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian George, Christoph Hirche, Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>In classical information theory, the Doeblin coefficient of a classical channel provides an efficiently computable upper bound on the total-variation contraction coefficient of the channel, leading to what is known as a strong data-processing inequality. Here, we investigate quantum Doeblin coefficients as a generalization of the classical concept. In particular, we define various new quantum Doeblin coefficients, one of which has several desirable properties, including concatenation and multiplicativity, in addition to being efficiently computable. We also develop various interpretations of two of the quantum Doeblin coefficients, including representations as minimal singlet fractions, exclusion values, reverse max-mutual and oveloH informations, reverse robustnesses, and hypothesis testing reverse mutual and oveloH informations. Our interpretations of quantum Doeblin coefficients as either entanglement-assisted or unassisted exclusion values are particularly appealing, indicating that they are proportional to the best possible error probabilities one could achieve in state-exclusion tasks by making use of the channel. We also outline various applications of quantum Doeblin coefficients, ranging from limitations on quantum machine learning algorithms that use parameterized quantum circuits (noise-induced barren plateaus), on error mitigation protocols, on the sample complexity of noisy quantum hypothesis testing, and on mixing, distinguishability, and decoupling times of time-varying channels. All of these applications make use of the fact that quantum Doeblin coefficients appear in upper bounds on various trace-distance contraction coefficients of a channel. Furthermore, in all of these applications, our analysis using Doeblin coefficients provides improvements of various kinds over contributions from prior literature, both in terms of generality and being efficiently computable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaniv Kurman, Kieran Hymas, Arkady Fedorov, William J. Munro, James Quach</p>
            <p>Executing quantum logic in cryogenic quantum computers requires a continuous energy supply from room-temperature control electronics. This dependence on external energy sources creates scalability limitations due to control channel density and heat dissipation. Here, we propose quantum batteries (QBs) as intrinsic quantum energy sources for quantum computation, enabling the thermodynamic limit of zero dissipation for unitary gates. Unlike classical power sources, QBs maintain quantum coherence with their load,a property that, while theoretically studied, remains unexploited in practical quantum technologies. We demonstrate that a bosonic Fock state QB can supply the energy required for arbitrary unitary gates, regardless of the circuit's depth, via quantum field recycling while facilitating a universal gate set controlled by a single parameter per qubit: its resonant frequency. The relative detuning of each qubit from the QB's resonant frequency gives rise to qualitatively two gate types, off-resonance and around-resonance. The former facilitates dispersive gates which allow multi-qubit parity probing while the latter enables energy exchange between the QB and the qubits, driving both population transfer and entanglement generation. This mechanism utilizes the all-to-all connectivity of the shared-resonator architecture to go beyond the standard single- and two-qubit native gates of current platforms with gate timescales of few pi/g, where g is the qubit-resonator coupling. The resultant speed-up includes also superextensive gates between symmetric Dicke states, characteristic of QB systems. By eliminating the individual drive lines, this approach significantly reduces wiring overhead, potentially quadrupling the number of qubits integrated within cryogenic systems and offering a scalable architecture for quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Calculating the von Neumann entanglement entropy from experimental data is challenging due to its dependence on the complete wavefunction, forcing reliance on approximations such as classical mutual information (MI). We propose a machine learning approach using a graph neural network to predict the von Neumann entropy directly from experimentally accessible bitstrings. We test this approach on a Rydberg ladder system and achieve a mean absolute error of $3.6 \times 10^{-3}$ when evaluating within the training range on a dataset with entropy values ranging from 0 to 1.9. The model achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 1.44\% and outperforms MI-based bounds. When tested beyond the training range, the model maintains reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the model with small datasets significantly improves performance on data outside the original training range.</p>

            <p>The largely technical noise of a free running laser is the fundamental limit for preparation of a bright squeezed light, especially within MHz band. We construct a universal and complete theoretical model for nonclassical stabilization, and propose a novel bright squeezed light generation scheme with assistance of a hybrid noise stabilization technology. The scheme assimilates a broadband passive noise stabilization to successfully extend the feedback frequency bandwidth of a nonclassical active stabilization to MHz band. Meanwhile, the technical noise suppression magnitude is further improved by 9 dB, which creates the prerequisite conditions for preparing a broadband bright squeezed light. Finally, a -5.5 dB bright squeezed light with a power of 1 mW and a squeezing bandwidth among kHz to MHz band was generated. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical one. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first demonstration of a milliwatt-order bright squeezed light across the kHz frequency band. The demonstration sheds light on potential applications of bright squeezed light in quantum metrology and might enable new concepts in the future.</p>

            <p>Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $k=6\sim13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</p>

            <h2>Performance guarantees of light-cone variational quantum algorithms for the maximum cut problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyang Wang, Yuexin Su, Tongyang Li</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising to demonstrate the advantage of near-term quantum computing over classical computing in practical applications, such as the maximum cut (MaxCut) problem. However, current VQAs such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower performance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and suffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We propose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard VQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while avoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone VQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut problem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of the 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation procedure. Finally, our numerical results indicate an exponential speed-up in finding the exact solution using the light-cone VQA compared with the classical algorithm. Using IBM's quantum devices, we demonstrate that the single-round light-cone VQA exceeds the known classical hardness threshold in both 72- and 148-qubit demonstrations, whereas $p$-round $\text{QAOA}$ with $p=1,2,3$ does not in the latter one.

            <h2>Computing $n$-time correlation functions without ancilla qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyang Wang, Long Xiong, Xiaoxia Cai, Xiao Yuan</p>
            <p>The $n$-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of $n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure the single-particle spectrum of the Schwinger model and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the demonstration, we further introduce an error mitigation procedure based on signal processing that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise.</p>

            <h2>A streamlined demonstration that stabilizer circuits simulation reduces to Boolean linear algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vsevolod I. Yashin</p>
            <p>Gottesman-Knill theorem states that computations on stabilizer circuits can be simulated on a classical computer, conventional simulation algorithms extensively use linear algebra over bit strings. For instance, given a non-adaptive stabilizer circuit, the problem of computing the probability of a given outcome (strong simulation) is known to be log-space reducible to solving the system of linear equations over Boolean variables, which is commonly done by Gaussian elimination. This note aims to make the connection between stabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this, we extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau descriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding the tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear algebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer tableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of channels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the diagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian eliminations. This approach gives a new perspective on explaining the work of stabilizer tableau methods (reproducing the asymptotics) and creates opportunity for exploring various tensor-contraction techniques in stabilizer simulation.</p>

            <h2>On estimating the quantum $\ell_α$ distance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yupan Liu, Qisheng Wang</p>
            <p>We study the computational complexity of estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$, defined via the Schatten $\alpha$-norm $\|A\|_{\alpha} = \mathrm{tr}(|A|^{\alpha})^{1/\alpha}$, given $\operatorname{poly}(n)$-size state-preparation circuits of $n$-qubit quantum states $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$. This quantity serves as a lower bound on the trace distance for $\alpha > 1$. For any constant $\alpha > 1$, we develop an efficient rank-independent quantum estimator for ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ with time complexity $\operatorname{poly}(n)$, achieving an exponential speedup over the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024). Our improvement leverages efficiently computable uniform polynomial approximations of signed positive power functions within quantum singular value transformation, thereby eliminating the dependence on the rank of the quantum states. Our quantum algorithm reveals a dichotomy in the computational complexity of the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem with Schatten $\alpha$-norm (QSD$_{\alpha}$), which involves deciding whether ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ is at least $2/5$ or at most $1/5$. This dichotomy arises between the cases of constant $\alpha > 1$ and $\alpha=1$: - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq \alpha \leq O(1)$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. - For any $1 \leq \alpha \leq 1+\frac{1}{n}$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete, implying that no efficient quantum estimator for $\mathrm{T}_\alpha(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ exists unless $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{QSZK}$. The hardness results follow from reductions based on new rank-dependent inequalities for the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance with $1\leq \alpha \leq \infty$, which are of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Quantum computational speedup and retrocausality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Castagnoli</p>
            <p>Involving only the measurements of commuting observables - the problem-setting and the corresponding solution - quantum algorithms should be subject to classical logic. This would allow flanking their customary quantum description with a classical logic description, with surprising consequences. In the classical logic description of the quantum algorithm, very simply, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance, before beginning her problem-solving action, one of the possible halves of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will produce and measure in the future and could use this knowledge to produce the solution with fewer computation steps. This is a causal loop whose retrocausal character turns out to be implicit in the very notion of quantum state superposition, both an essential ingredient of the quantum computational speedup and one of the pillars of quantum mechanics. Indeed, the key point of the work is that the classical logic description of a quantum state superposition must resort to a logical form of retrocausality that in turn must be physically implicit in the superposition itself. The existence of retrocausality in ordinary quantum physics implies e different way of viewing physical reality. It explains in a unified way all quantum speedups and quantum nonlocality. It highlights the teleological character of quantum algorithms, that is, their being evolutions toward a goal (the solution of the problem) with an attractor in the solution they will produce in the future (the solution again). Under the quantum cosmological assumption, it provides a plausible physical basis to the teleological character of natural evolutions.</p>

            <p>Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.</p>

            <h2>Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendra I. Nurdin</p>
            <p>An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) is determined by the ``diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the ``off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</p>

            <p>Symmetric quantum states are fascinating objects. They correspond to multipartite systems that remain invariant under particle permutations. This symmetry is reflected in their compact mathematical characterisation but also in their unique physical properties: they exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement and notable robustness against noise and perturbations. These features make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical structure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the theoretical framework, robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties of symmetric states in experimental settings are essential. In this regard, we explore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell tests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric systems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant applications in which these states outperform other classes of states in specific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum metrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine their contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present the current state-of-the-art in their experimental generation, ranging from systems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review the most significant results obtained in the different experimental realizations. Despite the notable progress made in recent years with regard to the characterisation and application of symmetric quantum states, several intriguing questions remain unsolved. We conclude this review by discussing some of these open problems and outlining promising directions for future research.</p>

We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</p>

Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.</p>

            <h2>Collapses in quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proofs and the quantum polynomial hierarchy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartik Anand, Kabgyun Jeong, Junseo Lee</p>
            <p>We investigate the structure of quantum proof systems by establishing collapse results that reveal simplifications in their complexity landscape. By extending classical theorems such as the Karp-Lipton theorem to quantum settings and analyzing uniqueness in quantum-classical PCPs, we clarify how various constraints influence computational power. Our main contributions are: (1) We show that restricting quantum-classical PCPs to unique proofs does not reduce their power: $\mathsf{UniqueQCPCP} = \mathsf{QCPCP}$ under $\mathsf{BQ}$-operator and randomized reductions. This parallels the known $\mathsf{UniqueQCMA} = \mathsf{QCMA}$ result, indicating robustness of uniqueness even in quantum PCP-type systems. (2) We prove a non-uniform quantum analogue of the Karp-Lipton theorem: if $\mathsf{QMA} \subseteq \mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}$, then $\mathsf{QPH} \subseteq \mathsf{Q\Sigma}_2/\mathsf{qpoly}$. This conditional collapse suggests limits on quantum advice for $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problems. (3) We define a bounded-entanglement version of the quantum polynomial hierarchy, $\mathsf{BEQPH}$, and prove that it collapses above the fourth level. We also introduce the separable hierarchy $\mathsf{SepQPH}$ (zero entanglement), for which the same collapse result holds. These collapses stem not from entanglement, as in prior work, but from the convex structure of the protocols, which renders higher levels tractable. Collectively, these results offer new insights into the structure of quantum proof systems and the role of entanglement, uniqueness, and advice in defining their complexity.</p>

            <h2>Gradient-Based Excitation Filter for Molecular Ground-State Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runhong He, Qiaozhen Chai, Xin Hong, Ji Guan, Guolong Cui, Shengbin Wang, Shenggang Ying</p>
            <p>Molecular ground-state simulation is one of the most promising fields for demonstrating practical quantum advantage on near-term quantum computers. However, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a leading algorithm for this task, still faces significant challenges due to excessive circuit depth. This paper introduces a method to efficiently simplify the Unitary Coupled-Cluster with Single and Double Excitations (UCCSD) ansatz on classical computers. We propose to estimate the correlation energy contributions of excitations using their gradients at Hartree-Fock state, supported by a theoretical proof. For molecular systems with $K$ orbitals, these gradients can be obtained with complexity only $O(K^8)$, which can be efficiently implemented on classical computers, especially in parallel. By sorting and truncating the excitations based on these gradients, the simplified ansatz can be obtained immediately, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing ansatz structure on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to indirectly identify critical excitations through spin-adapted constraints, reducing gradient computations by $60\%$. Numerical experiments on prototype molecular systems (H${_4}$, HF, H${_2}$O, BeH${_2}$ and NH$_3$) demonstrate that our approach achieves up to $46\%$ parameter decrease, $60\%$ circuit depth reduction and $678\times$ runtime speedup compared to the state-of-the-art ADAPT-VQE algorithm, enabling significantly more compact quantum circuits with enhanced near-term feasibility.</p>

            <h2>Tight Success Probabilities for Quantum Period Finding and Phase Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malik Magdon-Ismail, Khai Dong</p>
            <p>Period finding and phase estimation are fundamental in quantum computing. Prior work has established lower bounds on their success probabilities. Such quantum algorithms measure a state $|\hat\ell\rangle$ in an $n$-qubit computational basis, $\hat\ell \in [0, 2^n - 1]$, and then post-process this measurement to produce the final output, in the case of period finding, a divisor of the period $r$. We consider a general post-processing algorithm which succeeds whenever the measured $\hat\ell$ is within some tolerance $M$ of a positive integer multiple of $2^n / r$. We give new (tight) lower and upper bounds on the success probability that converge to 1. The parameter $n$ captures the complexity of the quantum circuit. The parameter $M$ can be tuned by varying the post-processing algorithm (e.g., additional brute-force search, lattice methods). Our tight analysis allows for the careful exploitation of the tradeoffs between the complexity of the quantum circuit and the effort spent in classical processing when optimizing the probability of success. We note that the most recent prior work in most recent work does not give tight bounds for general $M$.</p>

            <p>The incompatibility of quantum measurements, i.e. the fact that certain observable quantities cannot be measured jointly is widely regarded as a distinctive quantum feature with important implications for the foundations and the applications of quantum information theory. While the standard incompatibility of multiple measurements has been the focus of attention since the inception of quantum theory, its generalizations, such as measurement simulability, $n$-wise incompatibility, and mulit-copy incompatibility have only been proposed recently. Here, we point out that all these generalizations are differing notions of the question of how many measurements are genuinely contained in a measurement device. We then show, that all notions do differ not only in their operational meaning but also mathematically in the set of measurement assemblages they describe. We then fully resolve the relations between these different generalizations, by showing a strict hierarchy between these notions. Hence, we provide a general framework for generalized measurement incompatibility. Finally, we consider the implications our results have for recent works using these different notions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Guillermo Carmona Rufo, Anupam Mazumdar, Carlos Sabín</p>
            <p>The recently introduced quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol aims to test the quantum nature of gravity by witnessing the entanglement produced by the virtual exchange of a graviton between two spatially superposed masses. Shortly after the original proposal, further improvements upon the experiment were suggested, including the addition of a third mass, showing that three-qubit setups can be more resilient to higher rates of decoherence caused by the interaction of the system with the environment. In this work, we investigate the type of tripartite entanglement generated in these three-qubit QGEM experiments when considering the effects of decoherence. We show that the gravitational interaction between the qubits is able to generate genuine tripartite entanglement between them, studying the corresponding parameter spaces and comparing the performance of the possible experimental configurations of the three qubits at allowing for the detection of genuine entanglement via an entanglement witness.</p>

            <p>The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach: coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization of quantum advantage in chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates with Less Overhead</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Kikura, Kazufumi Tanji, Akihisa Goban, Shinichi Sunami</p>
            <p>High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</p>

            <p>Time crystals constitute a novel phase of matter defined by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry. We present a scheme to realize a continuous-time crystal in the vibrational phonon mode of a trapped-ion system. By coupling two addressable traveling-wave lasers to the individual ions, we generate a nonlinear phonon mode with controllable linear gain and nonlinear damping via adiabatic elimination. This scheme enables stable dissipative dynamics over timescales significantly longer than the oscillation period, leading to the emergence of discrete time-translation symmetry breaking in the phonon mode, i.e., a phonon time crystal, under specific conditions. We further analyze the experimental feasibility and numerically demonstrate this phonon time crystal using accessible experimental parameters. These results provide a practical scheme for observing a time crystal in a nonlinear phonon mode, which will advance research into time crystals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lawrence Frolov, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka</p>
            <p>Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function inside a region $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and suppose that detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. The question how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which the detector surface registers the particle boils down to finding a reasonable mathematical definition of an ideal detecting surface; a particularly convincing definition, called the \emph{absorbing boundary rule}, involves a time evolution for the particle's wave function $\psi$ expressed by a Schrödinger equation in $\Omega$ together with an ``absorbing'' boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ first considered by Werner in 1987, viz., $\partial \psi/\partial n=i\kappa\psi$ with $\kappa>0$ and $\partial/\partial n$ the normal derivative. We provide here a discussion of the rigorous mathematical foundation of this rule. First, for the viability of the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely define the time evolution of $\psi$; we point out here how, under some technical assumptions on the regularity (i.e., smoothness) of the detecting surface, the Lumer-Phillips theorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a contraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the $N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. We also prove that the joint distribution of the detection times and places, according to the absorbing boundary rule, is governed by a positive-operator-valued measure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Chamon, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Ran Canetti</p>
            <p>Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1,2,3]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [4]. Here we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally-equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide.</p>

In addition, the method benefits from the reuse of intermediate calculations.

            <p>We analyze convergence of gradient-descent methods on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we study randomization of Riemannian gradient algorithms for minimizing smooth cost functions (of Morse-Bott type). We prove that randomized gradient descent methods, where the Riemannian gradient is replaced by a random projection of it, converge to a single local optimum almost surely despite the existence of saddle points. We consider both uniformly distributed and discrete random projections. We also discuss the time required to pass a saddle point. As a major application, we consider ground-state preparation through quantum optimization over the unitary group. In mathematical terms our randomized algorithm applied to the trace function $U \to \operatorname{tr}(AU\rho U^*)$ almost surely converges to its global minimum. The minimum corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue (ground state) of the selfadjoint operator $A$ (Hamiltonian) if $\rho$ is a rank-one projector (pure state). In this setting, one can efficiently replace the uniform random projections by implementing so-called discrete unitary 2-designs.</p>

            <p>We say that a matrix $P$ with non-negative entries majorizes another such matrix $Q$ if there is a stochastic matrix $T$ such that $Q=TP$. We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multivariate divergences that generalize the Rényi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</p>

            <p>Electron correlation and higher-order relativistic effects are probed in the evaluation of scalar and tensor static electric dipole (E1) polarizabilities ($\alpha_d$) of several even- and odd-parity states in cesium (Cs) using the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, second-order perturbation theory (MBPT(2)), third-order perturbation theory (MBPT(3)), random phase approximation (RPA), and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster (RCCSD) method. To account for perturbation due to odd-parity E1 operator on the atomic orbitals, calculations are carried out in the linear response approach. Our final $\alpha_d$ values, with the estimated uncertainties, show reasonably good agreement with the previous calculations and available experimental results. Differences among the DHF, MBPT(2), MBPT(3) and RPA results indicate pair-correlation (PC) effects play major roles than the core-polarization (CP) effects in the determination of $\alpha_d$ values in Cs. From the differences among the MBPT(3) and RCC results, we find correlations among the PC and CP effects and double CP effects together are also significant in these calculations. Contributions from the Breit interactions are found to be quite large in the high-lying states.</p>

Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction. We also discuss the Higgs vacuum near small-mass black holes.</p>

            <p>Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Liang</p>
            <p>Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.</p>

            <h2>Switchable coherent state stored quantum batteries with large ergotropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. F. Li, S. R. He, P. H. Ouyang, X. N. Feng, L. F. Wei</p>
            <p>Quantum battery (QB) is a conceptually new energy storage and conversion device, which consists usually of a quantum charger and an energy store (called usually as the QB for simplicity). The demonstrated advantage of QB, over its classical counterpart, is that its charging efficiency can be significantly enhanced by using quantum entanglement resources. In this letter, we investigate alternatively how to realize the switchable charging and the lossless power detection of the charged QB. With the proposed QB configuration we show that, by adjusting the eigenfrequency of the qubit-based charger, the cavity-based QB can be switched on between the charging and power-off states and its stored energy can be non-destructively monitored by probing the transmitted spectrum of the external electromagnetic waves scattered by the qubit-based charger. As the qubit-based charger has never been excited, the proposed cavity-based QB could directly store the coherent state energy (rather than the single-photon one) and thus possess significantly large ergotropy. The physical realization of the proposed switchable QB configuration is demonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit quantum electrodynamical devices.</p>

            <h2>Thermal Effects in the Casimir Torque between Birefringent Plates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Spreng, Jeremy N. Munday</p>
            <p>The Casimir effect, originating from quantum and thermal fluctuations, is well known for inducing forces between closely spaced surfaces. When these surfaces are optically anisotropic, these interactions can produce a Casimir torque that rotates the surfaces relative to each other. We investigate, for the first time, the influence of thermal fluctuations on the Casimir torque between birefringent plates. Our results reveal that thermal modes significantly diminish the torque, with reductions up to 2 orders of magnitude for highly birefringent materials. Temperature is also shown to alter the angular dependence of the torque, significantly deviating from the typical sinusoidal behavior, and becomes particularly important at large separations that exceed the thermal wavelength. Finally, we demonstrate that systems of dissimilar birefringent plates that exhibit a distance-dependent reversal in the torque's direction can enable precise control of the torque's magnitude and sign through temperature manipulation. These findings advance our understanding of quantum and thermal fluctuation interplay and provide a framework for designing innovative nanoscale sensors and devices leveraging Casimir torque phenomena.</p>

By periodically modulating two distinct single-photon states under a modulation frequency which is exactly equal to the spectral mismatch of two cavity modes, a pair of single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) states is prepared energy-conservatively based on full unitary operations. The two states show high indistinguishability with an ideal $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{HOM}(0)$ down to zero due to the superposition of intensity-matched single-photon states coherently distributed across the teeth of the combs.</p>

            <p>Presence of harmful noise is inevitable in entanglement-enhanced sensing systems, requiring careful allocation of resources to optimize sensing performance in practical scenarios. We advocate a simple but effective strategy to improve sensing performance in the presence of noise. Given a fixed number of quantum sensors, we partition the preparation of GHZ states by preparing smaller, independent sub-ensembles of GHZ states instead of a GHZ state across all sensors. We perform extensive analytical studies of the phase estimation performance when using partitioned GHZ states under realistic noise -- including state preparation error, particle loss during parameter encoding, and sensor dephasing during parameter encoding. We derive simple, closed-form expressions that quantify the optimal number of sub-ensembles for partitioned GHZ states. We also examine the explicit noisy quantum sensing dynamics under dephasing and loss, where we demonstrate the advantage from partitioning for maximal QFI, short-time QFI increase, and the sensing performance in the sequential scheme. The results offer quantitative insights into the sensing performance impact of different noise sources and reinforce the importance of resource allocation optimization in realistic quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous discharging of quantum batteries: the ergotropic Mpemba effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Medina, Oisín Culhane, Felix C. Binder, Gabriel T. Landi, John Goold</p>
            <p>Anomalous thermal relaxation is ubiquitous in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. An emblematic example of this is the Mpemba effect, where an initially ``hot'' system cools faster than an initially ``cooler'' one. This effect has recently been studied in a variety of different classical and quantum settings. In this Letter, we find a novel signature of the Mpemba effect in the context of quantum batteries. We identify situations where batteries in higher charge states can discharge faster than less charged states. Specifically, we consider a quantum battery encoded in a single bosonic mode that is charged using unitary Gaussian operations. We show that the ergotropy, used here as a dynamical indicator of the energy stored in the battery, can be recast as a phase space relative entropy between the system's state and the unitarily connected passive state, at each time. Our formalism allows us to compute the ergotropy analytically under dissipative dynamics and allows us to understand the conditions which give rise to a Mpemba effect. We also find situations where two batteries charged to the same value using different operations can discharge at different rates.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Error Correction near the Coding Theoretical Bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Komoto, Kenta Kasai</p>
            <p>Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</p>

            <h2>Induced Berry Connection and Photonic Spin Hall Effect in Optical Dirac Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lili Yang, Longlong Feng</p>
            <p>Within the framework of optical Dirac theory, we present a field-theoretical model of spin-orbit interaction and photonic spin/orbit Hall effects. Our approach reformulates light propagation along helical paths as solving the Maxwell equations in a ray-based curvilinear coordinate system. This system can alternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric elements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode characterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order, the resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a uniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation coupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting as extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin angular momentum (SAM) of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture, the spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in the ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent waves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically polarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light. This distinction underscores the role of spin-orbit coupling in modifying phase accumulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Fallas Padilla, Visal So, Abhishek Menon, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano</p>
            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <p>The realization of a global quantum network holds the potential to enable groundbreaking applications such as secure quantum communication and blind quantum computing. However, building such a network remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to photon loss in optical fibers. In this work, we propose a quantum repeater architecture for distributing entanglement over intercontinental distances by leveraging low-Earth-orbit satellites equipped with spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon-pair sources and ground stations utilizing single-atom memories in optical cavities and single-photon detectors to implement the cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) gates for high-fidelity entanglement mapping. The efficient entanglement swapping is achieved by performing high-fidelity Rydberg gates and readouts. We evaluate the entanglement distribution rates and fidelities by analyzing several key imperfections, including time-dependent two-photon transmission and time-dependent pair fidelity, for various satellite heights and ground station distances. We also investigate the impact of pair source fidelity and spin decoherence rate on the repeater performance. Furthermore, we introduce a spatial-frequency multiplexing strategy within this architecture to enhance the design's performance. Finally, we discuss in detail the practical implementation of this architecture. Our results show that this architecture enables entanglement distribution over intercontinental distances. For example, it can distribute over 10000 pairs per flyby over 10000 km with a fidelity above 90%, surpassing the capabilities of terrestrial quantum repeaters</p>

            <p>The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach: coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization of quantum advantage in chemistry.</p>
