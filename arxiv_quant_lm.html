            <h2>On the possibility of differential algebraic elimination of the spinor field from the Maxwell-Dirac electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Akhmeteli</p>
            <p>We investigate whether the spinor field can be eliminated from the Maxwell-Dirac equations by differential algebraic methods. A generic truncated power series solution is constructed, the prolonged system of the Maxwell-Dirac electrodynamics is linearized about the solution, and the ranks of the associated coefficient matrices are computed. The results indicate that, generically, the spinor components are uniquely determined by the electromagnetic field and its derivatives. This strongly suggests that differential-algebraic elimination of the spinor field is possible.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement-assisted Hamiltonian dynamics learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayaka Usui, Guillermo Abad-López, Hari krishnan SV, Anna Sanpera, Some Sankar Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>Approximating the dynamics given by a complex many-body Hamiltonian with a simpler effective model lies at the interface of quantum Hamiltonian learning and quantum simulation. In this context, quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been shown to outperform standard Trotter-based approximations. However, their performance is often hindered by training plateaus and local minima that become increasingly severe with system size. To overcome these limitations, we propose an entanglement-assisted learning strategy that couples a single randomly initialized auxiliary qubit to the learning system at an intermediate stage of the training process. The interplay between randomization and entanglement significantly enhances the learning performance of the protocol.</p>

            <h2>Multi-emitter oscillating bound states in Waveguide QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergi Terradas-Briansó, Carlos A. González-Gutiérrez, Iván Huarte, David Zueco, Luis Martin-Moreno</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms have emerged as promising candidates for exploring and implementing non-Markovian quantum phenomena. In this work, we investigate the formation and dynamics of superpositions of bound states in a cavity array waveguide coupled to two spatially separated quantum emitters. By tuning the system parameters, we show that spontaneous emission can drive the system into non-local equilibrium states in which both photonic and emitter populations exhibit persistent oscillations. These states arise from the coexistence of bound states embedded in the energy continuum and bound states outside it, leading to hybrid oscillatory modes. We analytically derive the conditions required for the emergence of these states, numerically simulate their formation through spontaneous emission, and predict their long-time behaviour. Our results demonstrate that such bound-state superpositions enable the generation of emitter-emitter interaction through free evolution, while supporting oscillatory breathing modes of the photon density between the emitters.</p>

            <h2>Squeezed superradiant lasing of a quantum many-body emitter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Wu Xiao, Chong Chen, Ren-Bao Liu</p>
            <p>In conventional lasers, the emitters are typically incoherent, radiating photons independently; in superradiant lasers, many coherent emitters radiate photons collectively, but they essentially do not interact with each other. Here, we present the concept of quantum many-body lasers, in which the emitters interact coherently and radiate collectively. In this proof-of-concept study, we consider a cavity coupled to many pumped spin-1/2 emitters with all-to-all interaction. We find that the squeezing induced by the coherent many-body interaction can be transferred from the spins to photons through superradiant lasing. This work illustrates the concept of using a pumped quantum many-body system to generate bright quantum light with quantum correlations beyond conventional optical coherence, which can facilitate quantum technologies and the study of nonlinear optics in the quantum realm.</p>

            <h2>Edge states and quantum optical high-harmonic generation from topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Saugbjerg Lange, Lars Bojer Madsen</p>
            <p>The strong-field process of high-harmonic generation (HHG) has, in recent years, been treated from a quantum optical perspective in the emerging research area of strong-field quantum optics. These investigations show that HHG radiation is, in general, in a nonclassical state of light. However, the quantum optical treatment of HHG from topological nontrivial materials is missing. Here, we aim to address this gap in current knowledge and consider the quantum optical HHG response from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a finite chain of atoms with both a topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating phase, the latter supporting edge states. We find that HHG from both topological phases is squeezed at the band-gap frequency. Interestingly, while the harmonic spectrum discriminates the two topological phases of the system, the degree of squeezing only discriminates the phases for smaller chain lengths. We attribute this difference to a relative increase in overlap between bulk and edge states in the topological nontrivial phase for smaller systems. Our findings reveal how the strength of dipole couplings governs the nonclassical HHG response and define new research questions on topologically protected generation of quantum light in strong-field physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative study of Silicon Waveguides for the Generation of Quantum Correlated Photon Pairs Bridging Mid-Infrared and Telecom Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Kumar Pandey, Deepak Jain, Catherine Baskiotis</p>
            <p>Sources of quantum correlated photons pairs bridging the 3um-4um Mid-infrared (MIR) band and Telecom/Near-Infrared/Visible band are of high importance for quantum technologies. Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion is generally used for realizing such sources, but requires costly implementation platforms with reduced versatility. Here, we explore the potentialities of Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM) in all-solid Silicon On Insulator (SOI) waveguides thanks to an experimentally validated model and propose designs ensuring the production of correlated photon pairs bridging the 3um-4um Mid-infrared band and Telecom C-band. Choosing a pump with a wavelength in the range 2100nm-2210nm and a pulse duration of 5ps, we quantitatively performed simulations targeting a probability of photon pair generation per pulse of 0.05, and we found realistic conditions of utilization (2cm-length straight waveguides, intra-modal Four Wave Mixing with the fundamental TE00 mode) with a pump peak power in between 9.2mW and 32mW. A first design (wCOM) reaches a signal wavelength as high as 3.905um, which is situated in an atmospheric transparency window, while maintaining an idler in the Telecom C-band, making it of high interest for atmospheric Quantum Key Distribution. Two other designs wCH4 and wNO2 aim precise CH4 and NO2 gas sensing with a signal wavelength of 3265nm and 3461nm respectively. In terms of signal/idler wavelength separation, wCOM attains the value of 2364nm which is well above the current record of ~1125nm obtained in quantum regime with SFWM in all-solid SOI waveguides.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels in a deep-subwavelength hyperbolic phonon polariton cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gian Marcello Andolina, Matteo Ceccanti, Bianca Turini, Riccardo Riolo, Marco Polini, Marco Schiró, Frank H.L. Koppens</p>
            <p>The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</p>

            <h2>Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou, Tao Xiang</p>
            <p>We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>A general theory of quantum measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shizhong Mei</p>
            <p>A universal energy eigenvalue equation is proposed in this paper. It is proven that the unique set of eigenfunctions or preferred basis exists for any non-isolated sub-system. Applying the new eigenvalue equation to the relative motion of a hydrogen atom together with the derived relativistic Hamiltonian to quantify the impact of finite proton mass to the fine structure, correction to the fine structure is obtained as a result of the entanglement of the relative motion and the center-of-mass motion, which can be used to verify the correctness of the proposed eigenvalue equation. Applying the equation to the measurement of electron double-slit interference, it is analyzed that the photon packets with Lorentzian spectral lineshape, the domain and state density of the sub-system, and the energy of the incident electron together determines the spontaneous emission rate of the incident electron. Photons generated in this process excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the detector. Corresponding to any emitted or absorbed photon, the sub-system is found to be uniquely determined by maximizing the transition rate. This new principle is valid for atoms too. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the transition rates and example numerical results show good correlation between calculation and the position measurement experiment. The discovered common mechanisms that determine the sub-systems, the preferred bases, and transition rates form the foundation of a new, general, and consistent theory of quantum measurement.</p>

            <h2>Experimental characterization of the hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quark pairs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoav Afik, Regina Demina, Alan Herrera, Otto Hindrichs, Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova, Baptiste Ravina</p>
            <p>Recent results from the Large Hadron Collider have demonstrated quantum entanglement of top quark-antiquark pairs using the spin degree of freedom. Based on the doubly differential measurement of the spin density matrix of the top quark and antiquark performed by the CMS collaboration in the helicity and beam bases, we evaluate a set of quantum observables, including discord, steering, Bell correlation, and magic. These observables allow for a quantitative characterization of the quantum correlations present in a top quark--antiquark system, thus enabling an interpretation of collider data in terms of quantum states and their properties. Discord is observed to be greater than zero with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations ($\sigma$). Evidence for steering is found with a significance of more than 3$\sigma$. This is the first evidence for steering, and the first observation of discord in a high-energy system. No Bell correlation is observed within the currently probed phase space, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These results experimentally corroborate the full hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quarks with discord being the most basic form of quantum correlation, followed by entanglement, steering and Bell correlation. The significance of nonzero magic, which is a complementary observable to the quantum-correlation hierarchy, is found to exceed 5$\sigma$ in several regions of phase space.</p>

            <h2>GKP-inspired high-dimensional superdense coding with energy-time entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Chi Chang, Arjun Mirani, Murat Can Sarihan, Xiang Cheng, Michelle Harasimowicz, Patrick Hayden, Chee Wei Wong</p>
            <p>Superdense coding, the application of entanglement to boost classical communication capacity, is a cornerstone of quantum communication. In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom and encoding information by time-frequency displacements. This approach leverages the inherently large Hilbert space found in quantum frequency combs, with resilience against both temporal and spectral errors. In addition to describing the theoretical structure of the protocol, we propose an experimental implementation using standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors and a frequency beamsplitter. We also analyze the effect of experimental noise and errors on the channel capacity of the protocol. We demonstrate that for realistic experimental parameters, contemporary technologies satisfy the prerequisites for superdense coding with biphoton frequency combs, achieving a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per transmitted photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors). This more than doubles the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme, while also having competitive optical loss. Furthermore, our results beat the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by 4.6 times. Our protocol thus represents an experimentally feasible application of time-frequency grid states to entanglement-assisted communication, contributing to the active fields of continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative Quantum Battery in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime Between Two Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-qiang Liu, Yi-jia Yang, Zheng Liu, Bao-qing Guo, Ting-ting Ma, Zunlue Zhu, Wuming Liu, Xingdong Zhao, Chang-shui Yu</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose an open quantum battery that stores and releases energy by employing a two-mode ultrastrongly coupled bosonic system, with one mode (the charger) coupled to an independent heat reservoir. Our results demonstrate that both the charging energy and ergotropy of the quantum batteries can be significantly enhanced within the ultra-strong coupling regime and across a broader temperature range in transient time. A unidirectional energy flow is achieved by controlling the system's initial state through its two-mode squeezed ground state. Furthermore, we show that the steady-state stored energy, along with its corresponding ergotropy, can be enhanced at larger temperatures and stronger coupling strengths. Notably, a purely beam-splitter or two-mode squeezing interaction yields zero ergotropy. These findings indicate that the enhanced stored energy and ergotropy of the quantum battery arises principally from the combined effects of beam-splitter and parametric amplification (squeezing) couplings. In addition, the presence of the squared electromagnetic vector potential term can prevent a phase transition and achieve a significant charging energy and high ergotropy in the deep-strong coupling regime. The results presented herein enhance our understanding of the operating principles of open bosonic quantum batteries.</p>

            <h2>Giant atoms coupled to waveguide: Continuous coupling and multiple excitations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiying Lin, Xinyu Zhao, Yan Xia</p>
            <p>We propose a stochastic Schrödinger equation (SSE) approach to investigate the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to a waveguide, addressing two critical gaps in existing research, namely insufficient exploration on continuous coupling and multiple excitations. A key finding is that continuous coupling, unlike discrete coupling at finite points, breaks the constant phase difference condition, thereby weakening the interference effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. In addition, a key technical advantage of the SSE approach is that auto- and cross-correlation functions can directly reflect the complex photon emission/absorption processes and time-delay effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. Moreover, the SSE approach also naturally handles multiple excitations, without increasing equation complexity as the number of excitations grows. This feature enables the investigation of multi-excitation initial states of the waveguide, such as thermal and squeezed initial states. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to waveguide, particularly for continuous coupling and multi-excitation systems.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian environment induced chaos in optomechanical system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> You-Lin Xiang, Xinyu Zhao, Yan Xia</p>
            <p>In traditional research, chaos is frequently accompanied by non-linearity, which typically stems from non-linear interactions or external driving forces. However, in this paper, we present the chaotic behavior that is completely attributed to the non-linear back-reaction of non-Markovian environment. To be specific, we derive the dynamical equations of an optomechanical system and demonstrate that the non-linearity (cause of chaos) in the equations arises entirely from the time-domain convolutions (TDCs) induced by non-Markovian corrections. Under Markovian conditions, these TDCs are reduced into constants, thereby losing the nonlinearity and ultimately leading to the disappearance of chaos. Furthermore, we also observe chaos generation in the absence of optomechanical couplings, which further confirms that the non-Markovian effect is the sole inducement of chaos and the environmental parameters play important roles in the generation of chaos. We hope these results may open a new direction to investigate chaotic dynamics purely caused by non-Markovian environments.</p>

            <h2>Cluster Ising quantum batteries can mimic super-extensive charging power</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Pavone, Federico Luigi Cavagnaro, Matteo Carrega, Riccardo Grazi, Dario Ferraro, Niccolò Traverso Ziani</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries, miniaturized devices able to store and release energy on demand, are promising both because their intrinsic energy and time scales can match those of other quantum technologies and due to the intriguing possibility of achieving super-extensive charging power. While this enhanced scaling is known to appear in several settings, it is generally believed to be forbidden in Wigner-Jordan integrable spin chains charged via quantum-quench protocols. Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit. This phenomenon appears robust against finite-temperature effects.</p>

            <h2>Controlling correlations of a polaritonic Luttinger liquid by engineered cross-Kerr nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nabaneet Sharma, Anushree Dey, Bimalendu Deb</p>
            <p>We study correlation properties of polaritons at zero temperature in a multiconnected Jaynes--Cummings (MCJC) lattice on a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics platform with engineered cross-Kerr nonlinearity that mimics attractive nearest-neighbour interaction. A multi-connected Jaynes--Cummings lattice is a one-dimensional lattice constructed from alternating qubits and resonators with different left and right couplings. The nearest-neighbour interaction or cross-Kerr coupling is implemented dispersively through ladder-type qutrits between each nearest neighboring pair of resonator modes. Projecting onto the lower-polaritonic manifold, we derive an extended two-mode (bipartite) Bose--Hubbard-like model featuring on-site and attractive nearest-neighbor interactions. Employing a continuum bosonization approach, we express the Hamiltonian in terms of symmetric ($+$) and antisymmetric ($-$) collective modes. In the regime where the ($-$) sector acquires a finite gap, one can reduce the system to an effective single-component Luttinger liquid model for the $+$ sector. The cross-Kerr term reduces the compressibility of the ($+$) mode, thereby enhancing the corresponding Luttinger parameter $K_{+}$, resulting in the slower algebraic decay of single-particle correlations, $G(x)\propto|x|^{-1/(4K_{+})}$.</p>

            <p>Entanglement swapping between photon pairs generated at physically separated nodes over telecommunication fiber infrastructure is an essential step towards the quantum internet, enabling applications such as quantum repeaters, blind quantum computing, distributed quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. However, successful networked entanglement swapping relies on generating indistinguishable pairs of photons and preserving them over deployed fibers. This has limited most previous demonstrations to laboratory settings or relied on sophisticated methods to maintain the necessary indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable entanglement swapping experiment using naturally indistinguishable entanglement sources based on warm atomic vapor cells. Without sharing lasers or optical frequency references between nodes, nor the need for pulsing the sources, we achieve a swapping rate of nearly 500 pairs/s while maintaining the CHSH parameter above 2. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by maintaining the quality of the entanglement swapping on 17.6-km of deployed fibers in NYC, relying on commercially available SPADs at the spoke nodes, SNSPDs at the hub and standard time-synchronization techniques. Our work paves the way for the practical deployment of large-scale hub-and-spoke quantum networks within cities and data centers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcella L. Xavier, Felipe A. Pinheiro, Romain Bachelard</p>
            <p>Chiroptical responses in atomic systems are usually weak, as they arise from the interference between electric- and much weaker magnetic-dipole transitions. We show that atoms arranged in chiral geometries can instead exhibit a strong collective chiroptical response mediated entirely by electric-dipole interactions. Using a coupled-dipole framework, we identify a regime of pronounced chiroptical response emerging at subwavelength interatomic separations, which can be tuned by the probe frequency. This enhancement is directly linked to the formation of subradiant collective modes. Our results establish a fundamental connection between geometric chirality and collective light-matter interactions, opening new pathways for engineering and exploiting chiral optical responses in atomic systems.</p>

            <h2>Mpemba effect in self-contained quantum refrigerators: Accelerated cooling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Mondal, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We consider the qubit-qutrit model of self-contained quantum refrigerator and observe the quantum Mpemba effect in its cooling. In this system, the qutrit acts as the refrigerator while the qubit is to be cooled. The entire system is coupled to three bosonic heat baths, due to which the dynamics of the system is governed by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. We investigate the Liouvillian that generates the dynamics of the system and find that it has a block diagonal form. The dynamics of each element of the system's density matrix can be determined by solving the dynamical equation of the corresponding block that contains it. We find that the steady state belongs to the block containing only the diagonal elements in the energy basis. We numerically solve for the steady state and investigate the steady-state cooling over a significant region of the parameter space. Moreover, we demonstrate the quantum Mpemba effect in the refrigerator: a Mpemba state obtained by applying a unitary on the equilibrium state of the system reaches the steady state faster than the equilibrium state, despite the Mpemba state being initially farther away from the steady state. The Mpemba state thus leads to an acceleration in cooling of the cold qubit. We also find that both local and global unitaries on the qubit-qutrit system can generate the Mpemba state. Finally, we study the effect of the system-bath couplings on the Mpemba effect.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

Here, using proton-proton scattering as a quantum laboratory, we report the emergence of a near-pure Bell-triplet state at a laboratory energy of 151 MeV and a center-of-mass scattering angle of 90 degrees. In this unique kinematic regime, the scattering amplitude functions as a transition operator connecting distinct Bell states. Building upon this emergent resource, we propose a quantum teleportation protocol for proton spins, exploiting the intrinsic Hamiltonian of the strong interaction to perform the requisite Bell measurement. These findings effectively bridge few-body nuclear physics and quantum technology, establishing proton-proton scattering as both a source of high-fidelity entanglement and a natural processor for quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Microscopic Constructions and Continuum Topological Field Theory of Three-Dimensional Non-Abelian Topological Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhou Huang, Zhi-Feng Zhang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>In this paper, we establish an explicit correspondence between continuum topological field theory and microscopic lattice constructions of three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders. While Wilson operators defined by gauge-field holonomies represent topological excitations at long distances, we explicitly construct microscopic lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, derive their fusion and shrinking rules microscopically, and show how non-Abelian shrinking channels are selectively controlled through the internal degrees of freedom of loop creation operators. Crucially, we demonstrate that the lattice shrinking rules satisfy the \textit{fusion-shrinking consistency} relations previously identified at long distances, thereby establishing these relations as a general, microscopically verifiable principle. Moreover, by computing the complete excitation spectrum alongside all fusion and shrinking data microscopically, we establish a correspondence between the $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and gauge group $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$. Through the precise microscopic construction of the $BF+AAB$ field theory, this work definitively addresses the long-standing skepticism regarding its microscopic realizability, which has persisted over the past years. Finally, our work bridges the gap between theories at long and short distances, taking a crucial step toward a more complete microscopic construction of topological data previously identified at long distances, including braiding, pentagon relations, and fusion-shrinking hexagon relations. This progress holds the potential to deepen our understanding of quantum matter across all length scales and foster collaboration between researchers from diverse fields and approaches.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement in quantum spin chains is strictly finite at any temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ainesh Bakshi, Soonwon Choi, Saúl Pilatowsky-Cameo</p>
            <p>Entanglement is the hallmark of quantum physics, yet its characterization in interacting many-body systems at thermal equilibrium remains one of the most important challenges in quantum statistical physics. We prove that the Gibbs state of any quantum spin chain can be exactly decomposed into a mixture of matrix product states with a bond dimension that is independent of the system size, at any finite temperature. As a consequence, the Schmidt number, arguably the most stringent measure of bipartite entanglement, is strictly finite for thermal states, even in the thermodynamic limit. Our decomposition is explicit and is accompanied by an efficient classical algorithm to sample the resulting matrix product states.</p>

            <h2>No-Go Theorem on Fault Tolerant Gadgets for Multiple Logical Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aranya Chakraborty, Daniel Gottesman</p>
            <p>Identifying stabilizer codes that admit fault-tolerant implementations of the full logical Clifford group would significantly advance fault-tolerant quantum computation. Motivated by this goal, we study several classes of fault-tolerant gadget constructions consisting of Clifford gates acting on the physical qubits, including transversal gadgets, code automorphisms, and fold-transversal gadgets. While stabilizer codes encoding a single logical qubit, most notably the [[7,1,3]] Steane code, are known to admit transversal implementations of the full logical Clifford group, no analogous examples are known for codes encoding multiple logical qubits. In this work, we prove a no-go theorem establishing that no stabilizer code admits a fully transversal implementation of the Clifford group on more than one logical qubit. We further strengthen this result by showing that fold-transversal implementations of the full logical Clifford group are impossible for stabilizer codes encoding more than two logical qubits. More generally, we introduce the notion of k-fold transversal gadgets and prove that implementing the full Clifford group on k logical qubits requires at least k-fold transversal gadgets at the physical level. In addition, we analyze code-automorphism based constructions and demonstrate that they also fail to realize the full Clifford group on multiple logical qubits for any stabilizer code. Together, these results place fundamental constraints on fault-tolerant Clifford gadget design and show that stabilizer codes supporting the full logical Clifford group on multiple logical qubits via these architectures do not exist. Since the Clifford group is a core component of universal gate sets, our findings imply that quantum computing with codes encoding multiple logical qubits within a single code block necessarily entails more complex constructions for fault tolerance.</p>

            <h2>Protection of Exponential Operation using Stabilizer Codes in the Early Fault Tolerance Era</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawei Zhong, Todd A. Brun</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction offers a promising path to suppress errors in quantum processors, but the resources required to protect logical operations from noise, especially non-Clifford operations, pose a substantial challenge to achieve practical quantum advantage in the early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) era. In this work, we develop a systematic scheme to encode exponential maps of the form $\exp(-i\theta P)$ into stabilizer codes with simple circuit structures and low qubit overhead. We provide encoded circuits with small first-order logical error rate after postselection for the [[n, n-2, 2]] quantum error-detecting codes and the [[5, 1, 3]], [[7, 1, 3]], and [[15, 7, 3]] quantum error-correcting codes. Detailed analysis shows that under the level of physical noise of current devices, our encoding scheme is 4--7 times less noisy than the unencoded operation, while at most 3% of runs need to be discarded.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Algorithm Framework for Phase-Contrast Transmission Electron Microscopy Image Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sean D. Lam, Roberto dos Reis</p>
            <p>We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) image formation using a fault-tolerant, gate-based quantum circuit model. The electron wavefield on an $N\times N$ grid is amplitude-encoded into a $2\log_2 N$-qubit register. Free-space propagation and objective-lens aberrations are implemented via two-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs) and diagonal phase operators in reciprocal space, while specimen interaction is modeled under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA) as a position-dependent phase grating. We validate projected potentials, contrast transfer function (CTF) behavior, and image contrast trends against classical multislice simulations for MoS$_2$ over experimentally relevant parameters, and provide resource estimates and key assumptions that determine end-to-end runtime. While extracting complete $N\times N$ intensity images requires $O(N^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements that preclude advantage for full-image reconstruction, the framework enables quantum advantage for tasks requiring Fourier-space queries, global image statistics, or phase-coherent observables inaccessible to classical intensity-only detection. This framework provides a physics-grounded mapping from CTEM theory to quantum circuits and establishes a baseline for extending toward full multislice and inelastic scattering models.</p>

            <h2>Efficient discrimination schemes for unextendible product bases with strong quantum nonlocality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiqi Feng, Huaqi Zhou, Limin Gao</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a central resource in quantum information science; therefore, it is important to design local discrimination protocols that minimize resource consumption. In this paper, we propose three entanglement-allocation schemes for the local discrimination of particular unextendible product bases (UPB) exhibiting strong quantum nonlocality in a \(3 \otimes 3 \otimes 3\) system. By exploiting the structural features of these UPB and the operational advantages of maximally entangled states, we further extend our protocols to strongly nonlocal UPB in \(d \otimes d \otimes d\) systems. In particular, we show that these UPB can be perfectly distinguished with only two maximally entangled states. Moreover, a resource-cost analysis indicates that our protocols, which avoid quantum teleportation whenever possible, can reduce the entanglement consumption. These results not only facilitate resource-efficient quantum information processing, but also provide further insight into the operational role of maximally entangled states.</p>

            <h2>Flux Pumped Kerr-Free Parametric Amplifier</h2>

            <p>We propose a flux-pumped superconducting parametric amplifier based on symmetrically threaded superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) that achieves a Kerr-free operating point under suitable drive conditions. Eliminating the Kerr nonlinearity is advantageous for quantum-limited amplification, as it mitigates unwanted distortions in squeezing and prevents degradation of both gain and quantum efficiency in the high-gain strong drive regime. By replacing the central junction in the symmetrically threaded SQUIDs (STS) configuration with a linear inductor, we find that the Kerr-nonlinearity can be eliminated and the effective Hamiltonian reduces to that of a degenerate parametric amplifier (DPA), up to higher-order corrections in the zero-point fluctuations of the superconducting phase operator. We show that the deviations from ideal DPA behavior introduced by these higher-order terms are significantly weaker than those associated with a Kerr nonlinearity. Consequently, the STS design can be driven strongly while maintaining near-quantum-limited performance at the Kerr-free point. Our analysis predicts phase-preserving gain and efficiency approaching the quantum limit, with robust operation demonstrated up to 25 dB of gain.</p>

            <h2>Strong-Field Quantum Metrology Beyond the Standard Quantum Limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsendsuren Khurelbaatar, R.T. Sang, Igor Litvinyuk</p>
            <p>Bridging quantum optics and strong-field physics provides a pathway to explore how quantum light shapes extreme nonlinear light-matter interactions. However, direct characterization of non-classical light at damage-threshold intensities remains an open question. Here, we theoretically investigate the impact of photon-number fluctuations of squeezed light on strong-field photoelectron holography using a quantum-optical strong-field approximation. We identify a mechanism, ponderomotive dephasing, whereby the inherent quantum fluctuations of the driving field dictate the stability of the electron's semiclassical action. While amplitude-squeezed light stabilizes the action to enhance holographic contrast, phase-squeezed light amplifies photon-number noise, causing a rapid collapse of fringe visibility. This quantum-optical sensitivity follows a steep quartic wavelength scaling, rendering mid-infrared drivers uniquely sensitive to the field's underlying quantum nature. Crucially, we show that the collapse of holographic contrast is not a loss of information but a metrological gain. By evaluating the Classical Fisher Information, we identify a "dark-port" mechanism in the tunneling tail that enables the estimation of field quadrature noise beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This fundamental trade-off between structural imaging fidelity and statistical sensitivity establishes the framework for Attosecond Quantum Tomography: an in-situ, reference-free protocol to reconstruct the Wigner distribution of intense quantum light. Our results identify strong-field ionization as a nonlinear quantum transducer, bridging attosecond electron dynamics with quantum information science.</p>

            <p>Synthetic frequency dimension offers a powerful approach to simulate lattice models and control photon dynamics. However, extending this concept into the quantum regime, particularly at the single-photon level, has remained challenging in photonic platforms. Here, we demonstrate quantum-state initialization and detection of single-photon evolutions within a synthetic frequency lattice by integrating a superconducting qubit with a 16-meter aluminum coaxial cable. A tunable superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based modulator is employed to synthesize lattice couplings and artificial gauge fields. We observe single-photon quantum random walks and Bloch oscillations, as well as nonadiabatic, unidirectional frequency conversion under rapid temporal modulation of the lattice Hamiltonian, together with band-structure measurements. The lattice connectivity can be readily reconfigured to construct higher-dimensional lattices using multiple drive tones. Our results establish superconducting quantum circuits as a versatile platform for programmable Hamiltonians and extensible synthetic lattices with flexible single-photon control.</p>

            <p>Aharonov-Bohm (AB) caging is a complete localization phenomenon in two-dimensional lattices due to destructive interference induced by the background gauge fields. However, current investigations of AB caging are mostly restricted to the Abelian gauge field case, and the observation of AB caging under non-Abelian gauge fields in a quantum system still remains elusive. Here, we report experimental realization of tunable synthetic non-Abelian SU(2) gauge fields in a rhombic lattice, engineered within the synthetic dimensions of a vibrating trapped ion with multiple levels. We realize AB caging under both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields and systematically investigate the distinctive transport properties of the non-Abelian case. In particular, we observe typical emergent quantum dynamics unique to non-Abelian AB caging, including initial-state-dependent dynamics, second-order effects, and asymmetric caging behavior. These observations demonstrate the trapped ion system as a powerful platform for simulating emergent phenomena in high-dimensional quantum systems with exotic synthetic gauge fields.</p>

            <h2>Quantum entanglement enhanced via dark mode control in molecular optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Kongkui Berinyuy, P. Djorwé, A. N. Al-Ahmadi, H. Ardah, A.-H. Abdel-Aty</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is an interesting resource for modern quantum technologies, where generating multiple quantum entanglement is highly required. However, entanglement engineering between multiple modes is strongly suppressed by dark mode effect. Here, we proposed a scheme based on molecular cavity optomechanical structure that enhances quantum bipartite and tripartite entanglement via dark mode breaking. Our proposal consists of an optical cavity that hosts two molecular ensembles which are coupled through an intermolecular coupling. A vibrational hopping rate $J_m$ captures the intermolecular coupling that is phase modulated via the synthetic gauge field method. The breaking of the dark mode is controlled by tuning both the intermolecular coupling and its modulation phase. By adjusting these parameters in our proposal, we can flexibly switch between the Dark Mode Unbroken (DMU) and the Dark Mode Broken (DMB) regimes. We find that in the dark-mode-unbroken regime, the amount of the generated bipartite and tripartite entanglement is significantly low or is suppressed. In contrast, in the dark-mode-broken regime, the entanglement is greatly enhanced,i.e., up to twofold enhancement. Moreover, the generated entanglement is more resilient against thermal noise in the dark-mode-broken regime compared to the thermal robustness in the unbroken regime. Therefore, our proposed scheme serves as a benckmark system to improve quantum correlations engineering, and to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources for applications in numerous modern quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced multiparameter quantum estimation in cavity magnomechanics via a coherent feedback loop</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adnan Naimy, Abdallah Slaoui, Abderrahim Lakhfif, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>Multiparameter quantum metrology plays a fundamental role in uncovering and exploiting the distinctive features of quantum systems. In this work, we propose an effective and experimentally feasible scheme to significantly enhance the simultaneous quantum estimation of the photon magnon and magnon mechanical coupling strengths in a hybrid cavity magnon mechanical platform. Our approach relies on the assistance of a coherent feedback loop combined with the injection of a coherent driving field. We show that an appropriate tuning of the system and feedback parameters leads to a substantial reduction of the estimation errors associated with both coupling strengths. To quantify the metrological performance of the proposed scheme, we employ the quantum Cramer Rao bound (QCRB) as a fundamental benchmark for multiparameter estimation. We explicitly compute and compare the QCRBs derived from the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) formalisms. Our results demonstrate that the RLD based QCRB is systematically lower than the SLD based bound, indicating superior estimation precision in the considered noncommutative estimation scenario. We further analyze the performance of heterodyne detection and show that, in suitable parameter regimes, the corresponding classical estimation precision closely approaches the ultimate quantum limit predicted by our scheme. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed setup within currently available cavity magnon mechanical platforms. Owing to its general character, the framework developed here can be readily extended to the high precision estimation of other physical parameters in hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Erratic Liouvillian Skin Localization and Subdiffusive Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems with globally reciprocal couplings -- such as the Hatano-Nelson model with stochastic imaginary gauge fields -- avoid the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, displaying erratic bulk localization while retaining ballistic transport. An open question is whether similar behavior arises when non-reciprocity originates at the Liouvillian level rather than from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained via post-selection. Here we investigate this scenario in a lattice model with globally reciprocal Liouvillian dynamics and locally asymmetric incoherent hopping, a disordered setting in which Liouvillian-specific effects have remained largely unexplored. While the steady state again shows disorder-dependent, erratic localization without boundary accumulation, we find that global reciprocity in the Liouvillian does not protect transport. Instead, in the regime dominated by incoherent hopping, excitations spread via Sinai-type subdiffusion, dramatically slower than the ordinary diffusion found in symmetric stochastic lattices. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between globally reciprocal Hamiltonian and Liouvillian dynamics: global reciprocity suppresses the skin effect in both cases, but only in Liouvillian dynamics can it coexist with ultra-slow, disorder-induced subdiffusive transport.</p>

            <h2>Projections with Respect to Bures Distance and Fidelity: Closed-Forms and Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Afham, Marco Tomamichel</p>
            <p>We derive simple and unified closed-form expressions for projections with respect to fidelity (equivalently, the Bures and purified distances) onto several sets of interest. These include projections of bipartite positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices onto the set of PSD matrices with a given marginal, and projections of ensembles of PSD matrices onto the set of PSD decompositions of a given matrix, with important special cases corresponding to projections onto the set of quantum channels (via the Choi isomorphism) and onto the set of measurements. We introduce prior-channel decompositions of completely positive (CP) maps, which uniquely decompose any CP map into a prior PSD matrix and a quantum channel. This decomposition generalizes the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism by establishing a bijective correspondence between arbitrary bipartite PSD matrices and channel-state pairs, and we show that it arises naturally from the fidelity projections developed here. As applications, we show that the pretty good measurement - associated with a weighted ensemble - is the fidelity projection of the ensemble onto the set of measurements, and that the Petz recovery map - associated with a reference state and forward channel - is the projection of a CP map (constructed from the channel-state pair) onto the set of reverse quantum channels, thereby recasting the well-known identification of the Petz map with quantum Bayes' rule in information-geometric terms. Our results also provide an information-geometric underpinning of the Leifer-Spekkens quantum state over time formalism [Leifer and Spekkens, Phys. Rev. A 88, 052130 (2013)].</p>

            <p>Photonic quantum memristors provide a measurement-induced route to nonlinear and history-dependent quantum dynamics. Experimental demonstrations have so far focused on isolated devices or simple cascaded devices configurations. Here, we experimentally realize and characterize a network of two coupled photonic quantum memristors with crossed feedback, implemented on a silicon nitride photonic integrated circuit and fed by a room-temperature single-photon source based on a silicon-vacancy color center SiV$^-$ in a nanodiamond. Each memristor consists of an integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose transfer function is adaptively updated by photon detection events on another memristor, thus generating novel non-Markovian input-output dynamics with an enhanced memristive behaviour compared to single devices. In particular, we report inter-memristor input-output hysteresis curves exhibiting larger form factors and displaying self-intersecting loops, respectively revealing marked bistability and topologically non-trivial memory dynamics. Furthermore, numerical simulations show how these features emerge from the interplay between memory depth and relative input phase, for both intra- and inter-memristor input-output relations. Our results establish coupled integrated photonic quantum memristors as scalable nonlinear building blocks and highlight their potential for implementing compact quantum neuromorphic and reservoir computing architectures.</p>

            <p>Quantum states with sub-Planck features exhibit sensitivity to phase-space displacements beyond the standard quantum limit, making them useful for quantum metrology. In the context of the SU(1,1) group, sub-Planck features have been constructed through the superposition of four Perelomov coherent states on the hyperbolic plane (the SU(1,1) compass state). However, these structures differ in scale along different phase-space directions, resulting in nonuniform sensitivity enhancement. We overcome this limitation by constructing $\overline{n}$-component compass states, which are obtained by superposing $\overline{n} \geq 6$ SU(1,1) coherent states, with an even total number, evenly arranged along a circular path on the hyperbolic plane; that is, all components lie at the same distance from the origin and have equal angular spacing of $\frac{2\pi}{\overline{n}}$. These generalized SU(1,1) compass states generate circularly shaped sub-Planck features (isotropic sub-Planckness) and provide uniform enhancement in sensitivity to phase-space displacements. As the number of coherent states $\overline{n}$ increases, these refinements progressively improve. While verified for $\overline{n} = 16$ SU(1,1) coherent states, the results remain valid for superpositions with arbitrarily large $\overline{n}$ components.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ugo Nzongani, Dylan Laplace Mermoud, Arthur Braida</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices, yet its scalability is limited by the difficulty of optimizing \(2p\) variational parameters for a large number \(p\) of layers. Recent empirical studies indicate that optimal QAOA angles exhibit concentration and transferability across problem sizes. Leveraging this observation, we propose a schedule-learning framework that transfers spectral-gap-informed adiabatic control strategies from small-scale instances to larger systems. Our method extracts the spectral gap profile of small problems and constructs a continuous schedule governed by \(\partial_t s = \kappa g^q(s)\), where \(g(s)\) is the instantaneous gap and \((\kappa, q)\) are global hyperparameters. Discretizing this schedule yields closed-form expressions for all QAOA angles, reducing the classical optimization task from \(2p\) parameters to only \(2\), independent of circuit depth. This drastic parameter compression mitigates classical optimization overhead and reduces sensitivity to barren plateau phenomena. Numerical simulations on random QUBO and 3-regular MaxCut instances demonstrate that the learnt schedules transfer effectively to larger systems while achieving competitive approximation ratios. Our results suggest that gap-informed schedule transfers provide a scalable and parameter-efficient strategy for QAOA.</p>

            <p>Programmability is increasingly central in emerging quantum network software stacks, yet the node-internal controller-to-hardware interface for quantum repeater devices remains under-specified. We introduce the idea of an instruction-set architecture (ISA) for controller-driven programmability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center quantum repeater nodes. Each node consists of an optically interfaced electron spin acting as a data qubit and a long-lived nuclear-spin register acting as a control program. We formalize two modes of programmability: (i) deterministic register control, where the nuclear register is initialized in a basis state to select a specific operation on the data qubit; and (ii) coherent register control, where the register is prepared in superposition, enabling coherent combinations of operations beyond classical programmability. Network protocols are expressed as controller-issued instruction vectors, which we illustrate through a compact realization of the BBPSSW purification protocol. We further show that coherent register control enables interferometric diagnostics such as fidelity witnessing and calibration, providing tools unavailable in classical programmability. Finally, we discuss scalability to multi-electron and multi-nuclear spin architectures and connection to Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) and Kraus formulation.</p>

            <p>Superparamagnetism in nanoscale magnetic layers is a critical property for a wide range of spintronic-based sensor and computing applications. While conventional magnetization measurements can detect superparamagnetic signatures, they often require the application of high perturbative fields and are difficult to implement for magnetic layers integrated within functional devices. In this study, we non-invasively investigate the superparamagnetic spin dynamics of a nanoscale CoFeB layer of thickness 1.1 nm, deposited on a diamond substrate, by probing its low-frequency near-field electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers-based quantum dephasometry. Our measurements reveal an unconventional, non-monotonic temperature dependence of the dephasing time of NV centers, which we attribute to EM fluctuations produced by thermally driven superparamagnetic domain flipping in CoFeB. Our findings are further supported by the theoretical interpretation of the dephasing dynamics of NV centers and the complementary SQUID-based magnetization characterizations of the CoFeB layer. Additionally, exploiting the technique of NV dephasometry, we extract the spectral density of the EM fluctuations in CoFeB, which is used to isolate different components of the EM fluctuations acting on NV centers. We also measure the CoFeB-to-NV distance-dependent coherence times of NV centers to investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the CoFeB layer on the generated near-field EM fluctuations. These results provide critical insight into the magnetization dynamics and near-field EM environment of nanoscale magnetic layers. It also has significant implications for the development of hybrid quantum spintronic devices and applications involving nanoscale opto-magnetic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent P. Flynn, Lorenza Viola, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>Metastability, i.e., partial relaxation to long-lived, quasi-stationary states before true asymptotic equilibrium sets in, emerges ubiquitously in classical and quantum dynamical systems as a result of timescales separation. In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model. Our results constitute the first systematic study of dynamical metastability in nonlinear dynamics, directly relevant to spin-torque oscillator arrays, magnonic devices, and beyond.</p>

            <h2>QuaRK: A Quantum Reservoir Kernel for Time Series Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdallah Aaraba, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Ola Ahmad, Shengrui Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum reservoir computing offers a promising route for time series learning by modelling sequential data via rich quantum dynamics while the only training required happens at the level of a lightweight classical readout. However, studies featuring efficient and implementable quantum reservoir architectures along with model learning guarantees remain scarce in the literature. To close this gap, we introduce QuaRK, an end-to-end framework that couples a hardware-realistic quantum reservoir featurizer with a kernel-based readout scheme. Given a sequence of sample points, the reservoir injects the points one after the other to yield a compact feature vector from efficiently measured k-local observables using classical shadow tomography, after which a classical kernel-based readout learns the target mapping with explicit regularization and fast optimization. The resulting pipeline exposes clear computational knobs -- circuit width and depth as well as the measurement budget -- while preserving the flexibility of kernel methods to model nonlinear temporal functionals and being scalable to high-dimensional data. We further provide learning-theoretic generalization guarantees for dependent temporal data, linking design and resource choices to finite-sample performance, thereby offering principled guidance for building reliable temporal learners. Empirical experiments validate QuaRK and illustrate the predicted interpolation and generalization behaviours on synthetic beta-mixing time series tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Lovato, Giuseppe Carleo, Bryce Fore, Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Jane Kim, Arnau Rios, Noemi Rocco</p>
            <p>A long-standing goal of nuclear theory is to explain how the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei and neutron-star matter emerge from the underlying interactions among protons and neutrons. Achieving this goal requires solving the nuclear quantum many-body problem with high accuracy across a wide range of length scales and density regimes. In this review, we discuss how artificial neural network representations of the nuclear many-body wave function have significantly extended the capabilities of continuum quantum Monte Carlo methods. In particular, neural network quantum states enable calculations of larger systems than were previously accessible and provide a flexible framework for capturing phenomena that challenge conventional approaches, including the emergence of nuclear clusters and superfluid phases in dense matter. We highlight recent applications to finite nuclei, infinite nuclear and neutron matter, and dynamical processes relevant to lepton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus scattering. We also discuss conceptual and methodological connections with condensed matter physics, emphasizing developments in neural network quantum states that bridge strongly correlated systems across disciplines. Together, these developments demonstrate how neural-network methods open new avenues toward unified and accurate descriptions of nuclear structure, matter, and reactions.</p>

            <h2>Optical transport of cold atoms to quantum degeneracy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanqing Tao, Yufei Wang, Ligeng Yu, Bo Song</p>
            <p>Efficient transport of cold atoms is essential for continuous operation, enabling applications ranging from atomic lasers to continuously operated qubits. However, deep potentials required to overcome vibrations, axial trap nonuniformity and insufficient cooling have limited transport of cold atoms near quantum degeneracy. Here we demonstrate rapid optical transport of cold atoms to Bose-Einstein condensation using a moving optical lattice formed by two Bessel beams. A gas of $3 \times 10^5$ ytterbium atoms at a temperature of $340\,$nK is transported over $34\,$cm in $350\,$ms with efficiency over $60\%$. Furthermore, a degenerate gas of $1 \times 10^5$ atoms with a $40\%$ condensate fraction emerges from the phase synchronization process driven by atomic interactions. This demonstration enables the fast preparation of ultracold atomic beams and large-scale atom arrays for quantum sensing, simulation and computing.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</p>

            <h2>Variational preparation and characterization of chiral spin liquids in quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Yang Zhang, Donghoon Kim, Ji-Yao Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Multi-Robot Path Planning via Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier González Villasmil</p>
            <p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, where classical centralized approaches exhibit exponential growth in joint-state complexity as the number of agents increases. This paper investigates Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) as a structurally scalable alternative for simultaneous multi-robot path planning. This approach is a robotics-oriented QUBO formulation incorporating BFS-based logical pre-processing (achieving over 95% variable reduction), adaptive penalty design for collision and constraint enforcement, and a time-windowed decomposition strategy that enables execution within current hardware limitations. An experimental evaluation in grid environments with up to four robots demonstrated near-optimal solutions in dense scenarios and favorable scaling behavior compared to sequential classical planning. These results establish a practical and reproducible baseline for future quantum and quantum-inspired multi-robot coordinations.</p>

            <p>The quantum pigeonhole effect (QPE) appears to contradict the classical pigeonhole principle by allowing three quantum particles distributed between two boxes to exhibit no pairwise coincidence. We show that this effect does not signal a breakdown of classical counting, but instead arises from quantum contextuality. By deriving Bell-type inequalities directly from the pigeonhole principle and reformulating the weak-measurement protocol within a bipartite density-operator framework, we demonstrate that the QPE is a form of Bell's theorem without inequalities. The apparent paradox reflects the impossibility of non-contextual eigenvalue assignments rather than a violation of classical combinatorial logic.</p>

            <h2>Feasibility of performing quantum chemistry calculations on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thibaud Louvet, Thomas Ayral, Xavier Waintal</p>
            <p>Quantum chemistry is envisioned as an early and disruptive application for quantum computers. Yet, closer scrutiny of the proposed algorithms shows that there are considerable difficulties along the way. Here, we propose two criteria for evaluating two leading quantum approaches for finding the ground state of molecules. The first criterion applies to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. It sets an upper bound to the level of imprecision/decoherence that can be tolerated in quantum hardware as a function of the targeted precision, the number of gates and the typical energy contribution from states populated by decoherence processes. We find that decoherence is highly detrimental to the accuracy of VQE and performing relevant chemistry calculations would require performances that are expected for fault-tolerant quantum computers, not mere noisy hardware, even with advanced error mitigation techniques. Physically, the sensitivity of VQE to decoherence originates from the fact that, in VQE, the spectrum of the studied molecule has no correlation with the spectrum of the quantum hardware used to perform the computation. The second criterion applies to the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, which is often presented as the go-to replacement of VQE upon availability of (noiseless) fault-tolerant quantum computers. QPE requires an input state with a large enough overlap with the sought-after ground state. We provide a criterion to estimate quantitatively this overlap based on the energy and the energy variance of said input state. Using input states from a variety of state-of-the-art classical methods, we show that the scaling of this overlap with system size does display the standard orthogonality catastrophe, namely an exponential suppression with system size. This in turns leads to an exponentially reduced QPE success probability.</p>

            <p>If we want to transform the quantum state of a system to another using local measurement processes, what is the probability of success? This probability is bounded by quantifying entanglement in both the states. In this paper, we construct a family of local unitary invariants of multipartite states that are monotonic under local operations and classical communication on average. These monotones are constructed from local unitary invariant polynomials of the state and its conjugate, and hence are easy to compute for pure states. Using these measures we bound the success probability of transforming a given state into another state using local quantum operations and classical communication.</p>

            <p>Elegant Bell inequality is well known for its distinctive property, being maximally violated by maximal entanglement, mutually unbiased bases, and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure elements. Despite its significance in quantum information theory demonstrated based on its unique violation feature, it remains the only known one with the characteristic. We present a method to construct Bell inequalities with violation feature analogous to elegant Bell inequality in higher local dimensions from a simple, analytic quantum bound. A Bell inequality with the generalized violation feature is derived in three dimension for the first time. It exhibits larger violation than existing Bell inequalities of similar classes, including the original elegant Bell inequality, while requiring arguably small number of measurements.</p>

            <p>In the current quantum computing paradigm, significant focus is placed on the reduction or mitigation of quantum decoherence. When designing new quantum processing units, the general objective is to reduce the amount of noise qubits are subject to, and in algorithm design, a large effort is underway to provide scalable error correction or mitigation techniques. Yet some previous work has indicated that certain classes of quantum algorithms, such as quantum machine learning, may, in fact, be intrinsically robust to or even benefit from the presence of a small amount of noise. Here, we demonstrate that noise levels in quantum hardware can be effectively tuned to enhance the ability of quantum neural networks to generalize data, acting akin to regularisation in classical neural networks. As an example, we consider two regression tasks, where, by tuning the noise level in the circuit, we demonstrated improvement of the validation mean squared error loss. Moreover, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness by numerically simulating quantum neural network training on a realistic model of a noisy superconducting quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Neng Zhou, Chang Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and Rényi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon M. Linsel, Lode Pollet, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and (de-)confinement. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks enable forms of nonlocality beyond the standard Bell scenario, with a multitude of potential applications. Continuous-variable (CV) platforms are particularly attractive for large-scale networks, offering deterministic entanglement generation and favorable prospects for long-distance distribution. Here we present a formalism to study CV network nonlocality using pseudospin measurements. Considering the linear chain and star configurations, we derive the maximal violations of the corresponding network locality inequalities for arbitrary two-mode states. Using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, we show that the strength of nonlocality in the star configuration remains independent of the network size. Moreover, the nonlocal correlations persist even at arbitrarily high temperatures provided the squeezing exceeds a critical threshold. Further, we demonstrate non-Gaussianity as an enhancer of network nonlocality through illustrations of various classes of non-Gaussian resources. Remarkably, a coherent superposition of single-photon subtractions across modes achieves maximal violation for vanishing squeezing. Finally, we provide schematics of an experimentally feasible implementation of CV network nonlocality based on the isomorphism between pseudospin and spatial parity observables.</p>

            <p>Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to spatially interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for networking applications. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10 times improvement in finesse. Our work unlocks the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</p>

            <p>We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and with neutral atom qubits with error rates predicted near the threshold of the XZZX surface code. By making use of the extended Hilbert space, including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise bias which motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present an algorithmic treatment of the representation theory of the algebra of partially transposed permutation operators, denoted by $\mathcal{A}^d_{p,p}$, which is a matrix representation of the abstract walled Brauer algebra. We provide an explicit and fully developed framework for constructing irreducible matrix units within the algebra. In contrast to the established earlier Gelfand-Tsetlin type constructions, the presented matrix units are adapted to the action of the subalgebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_p] \times \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_p]$, where $\mathfrak{S}_p$ is the symmetric group. What is more, the basis is constructed in such a way that it produces the decomposition of the algebra into a direct sum of ideals, in contrast to its nested structure considered before. The decomposition of this kind has not been considered before in full generality. Our method reveals a recursive scheme for generating irreducible matrix units in all ideals of $\mathcal{A}^d_{p,p}$, offering a systematic approach that applies to small system sizes and arbitrary local dimensions. We apply the developed formalism to the algebra $\mathcal{A}^d_{2,2}$ and illustrate the algorithm in practice. In addition, using the constructed basis, we proved a novel contraction theorem for the elements from $\mathcal{A}^d_{3,3}$, which is the starting point for further investigations.</p>

This idea leads to dynamical quantum tomography, whose feasibility we characterize for general quantum dynamics using Krylov-based methods. Specializing to Markovian ones, we also provide deterministic tests, and randomized ones to effectively assess parametric dynamics. The limits of the methods are explored comparing unitary and open dynamics when a single observable is available, and the set of observables whose expectation can be reconstructed from the available ones characterized.

Standard multiplexing techniques are classical in that they do not make use of coherence between quantum channels nor account for decoherence rates that vary during a protocol's execution. In this paper, we first derive semiclassical limits to multiplexing for many-qubit protocols, and then introduce two techniques: single click quantum multiplexing and multi-server multiplexing. These can enable beyond-classical multiplexing advantages. We illustrate these techniques through three example applications: 1) entanglement generation between two asymetric quantum network nodes (i.e., repeaters or quantum servers with inequal memories), 2) remote state preparation between many end user devices and a single quantum node, and 3) remote state preparation between one end user device and many internetworked quantum nodes. By utilizing many noisy internetworked quantum devices instead of fewer low-noise devices, our multiplexing strategies enable new paths towards achieving high-speed many-qubit quantum network applications.</p>

            <h2>Reconfigurable Quantum Instruction Set Computers for High Performance Attainable on Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaohui Yang, Dawei Ding, Qi Ye, Cupjin Huang, Jianxin Chen, Yuan Xie</p>
            <p>The performance of current quantum hardware is severely limited. While expanding the quantum ISA with high-fidelity, expressive basis gates is a key path forward, it imposes significant gate calibration overhead and complicates compiler optimization. As a result, even though more powerful ISAs have been designed, their use remains largely conceptual rather than practical. To move beyond these hurdles, we introduce the concept of "reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers" (ReQISC), which incorporates: (1) a unified microarchitecture capable of directly implementing arbitrary 2Q gates equivalently, i.e., SU(4) modulo 1Q rotations, with theoretically optimal gate durations given any 2Q coupling Hamiltonians; (2) a compilation framework tailored to ReQISC primitives for end-to-end synthesis and optimization, comprising a program-aware pass that refines high-level representations, a program-agnostic pass for aggressive circuit-level optimization, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass that minimizes hardware mapping overhead. We detail the hardware implementation to demonstrate the feasibility, in terms of both pulse control and calibration of this superior gate scheme on realistic hardware. By leveraging the expressivity of SU(4) and the time minimality realized by the underlying microarchitecture, the SU(4)-based ISA achieves remarkable performance, with a 4.97-fold reduction in average pulse duration to implement arbitrary 2Q gates, compared to the usual CNOT/CZ scheme on mainstream flux-tunable transmons. Supported by the end-to-end compiler, ReQISC outperforms the conventional CNOT-ISA, SOTA compiler, and pulse implementation counterparts, in significantly reducing 2Q gate counts, circuit depth, pulse duration, qubit mapping overhead, and program fidelity losses. For the first time, ReQISC makes the theoretical benefits of continuous ISAs practically feasible.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence remains a fundamental challenge for advancing quantum technologies. Although dynamical decoupling can suppress decoherence noise, it frequently misestimates decoherence times due to control errors -- a previously underappreciated issue. Here, we present Hadamard phase cycling, a scalable non-Markovian quantum error mitigation method using group-structured phase configurations to filter spurious dynamics. Validated across molecular electron spins, nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, nuclear spins, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits, this technique enables accurate decoherence time characterization and enhanced state fidelity with linear complexity. Our results indicate that many reported ultralong decoherence times stem from artifacts like coherence-population mixing rather than genuine noise suppression. By ensuring dynamical authenticity, Hadamard phase cycling establishes a robust framework for reliable quantum control, paving the way for reassessment and advancement of coherence benchmarks in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Lindblad Dynamics: Rigorous Guarantees for Thermal and Ground State Preservation under System Bath Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Wang, Zhiyan Ding</p>
            <p>We establish new theoretical results demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of system bath interaction models for quantum thermal and ground state preparation. Unlike prior analyses, which typically relies on the Lindblad limit and require vanishing coupling strengths $o(1)$, we rigorously show that efficient state preparation remains possible far beyond this regime, even when the coupling strength is $\Theta(1)$. We first prove that even with constant coupling strength, the induced quantum channel still approximately fixes the target state. For thermal state preparation, we then develop a general perturbative framework that yields end to end complexity bounds outside weak coupling, and in particular proves that the mixing time scales as the inverse square of the coupling strength. This framework extends to broad Hamiltonian for which KMS detailed balance Lindbladians are known to mix. These bounds substantially improve upon prior results, and numerical simulations further confirm the robustness of the system bath interaction framework across both weak and strong coupling regimes.</p>

            <p>The generation of relativistic vortex electron beams via photoemission requires ultraviolet laser beams with well-controlled orbital angular momentum (OAM) and compatibility with radio-frequency (RF) photoinjector drive-laser systems. High-OAM vortex beams at a wavelength of 266 nm are generated using three fabricated diffractive optical elements integrated into an operational photoinjector beamline: a reflective fork grating, a high-topological-charge spiral phase plate, and binary axicons. The spiral phase plate produces a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with an OAM of l = 64 and a conversion efficiency of 80%, whereas binary axicons generate low-divergence quasi-Bessel beams forming a superposition of multiple OAM states with a finite OAM bandwidth imposed by their binary phase structure. Fork gratings provide flexible access to lower OAM values and enable robust modal diagnostics. The generated beams are characterized using cylindrical-lens mode conversion and radial intensity analysis, demonstrating practical control of both the OAM content and spectral bandwidth of ultraviolet structured light for accelerator-based applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Verma, Olga Solodovnikova, Jonas S. Neergaard-Nielsen, Ulrik L. Andersen</p>
            <p>Entanglement is central to quantum physics, yet detecting and exploiting it in non-Gaussian systems remains a major challenge. In continuous variable platforms, standard inseparability criteria based on Gaussian statistics-such as the Duan-Simon criterion-fail when quantum correlations are encoded in higher moments of the field quadratures. Here we introduce a framework for detecting non-Gaussian entanglement using higher-order quadrature cumulants. In the Gaussian limit, the lowest order condition reduces to the Duan criterion, while higher-order violations reveal entanglement inaccessible to second-order methods. We experimentally demonstrate a tomography-free certification of inseparability in photon-subtracted squeezed states of light, where Gaussian witnesses fail despite the presence of entanglement. We further show that such higher-order inseparability enables enhanced quantum teleportation of Wigner negativity as compared to Gaussian protocols. These results identify higher-order cumulants as natural observables for non-Gaussian entanglement and open new routes to harnessing non-Gaussian resources in continuous variable quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francis Boabang, Samuel Asante Gyamerah</p>
            <p>Variational Quantum Algorithms are a vital part of quantum computing. It is a blend of quantum and classical methods for tackling tough problems in machine learning, chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. Yet as these algorithms scale up, they cannot escape the barren-plateau phenomenon. As systems grow, gradients can vanish so quickly that training deep or randomly initialized circuits becomes nearly impossible. To overcome the barren plateau problem, we introduce a two-stage optimization framework. First comes the convex initialization stage. Here, we shape the quantum energy landscape, the Hilmaton landscape, into a smooth, low-energy basin. This step makes gradients easier to spot and keeps noise from derailing the process. Once we have gotten a stable gradient flow, we move to the second stage: nonconvex refinement. In this phase, we allow the algorithm to explore different energy minima, thereby making the model more expressive. Finally, we used our two-stage solution to perform quantum cryptanalysis of the quantum key distribution protocol (i.e., BB84) to determine the optimal cloning strategies. The simulation results showed that our proposed two-stage solution outperforms its random initialization counterpart.</p>

            <p>Position verification schemes are interactive protocols where entities prove their physical location to others; this enables interactive proofs for statements of the form "I am at a location $L$." Although secure position verification cannot be achieved with classical protocols (even with computational assumptions), they are feasible with quantum protocols. In this paper we introduce the notion of zero-knowledge position verification, which generalizes position verification in two ways: 1. enabling entities to prove more sophisticated statements about their locations at different times (for example, "I was NOT near location $L$ at noon yesterday"). 2. maintaining privacy for any other detail about their true location besides the statement they are proving. We construct zero-knowledge position verification from standard position verification and post-quantum one-way functions. The central tool in our construction is a primitive we call position commitments, which allow entities to privately commit to their physical position in a particular moment, which is then revealed at some later time.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology involves the application of quantum resources to enhance measurements. Several communities have developed quantum-metrology strategies that leverage effective time reversals. These strategies, we posit, form four classes. First, echo metrology begins with a preparatory unitary and ends with that unitary's time-reverse. The protocol amplifies the visibility of a small parameter to be sensed. Similarly, weak-value amplification enhances a weak coupling's detectability. The technique exhibits counterintuitive properties captured by a retrocausal model. Using the third strategy, one simulates closed timelike curves, worldlines that loop back on themselves in time. The fourth strategy involves indefinite causal order, which characterises channels applied in a superposition of orderings. We review these four strategies, which we unify under the heading of time-reverse metrology. We also outline opportunities for this toolkit in quantum metrology; quantum information science; quantum foundations; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; and solid-state physics.</p>

            <h2>Suppression of Decoherence at Exceptional Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mei-Lin Li, Zuo Wang, Liang He</p>
            <p>Decoherence is strongly influenced by environmental criticality, with conventional Hermitian critical points typically enhancing the loss of quantum coherence. Here, we show that this paradigm is fundamentally altered in non-Hermitian environments. Focusing on qubits coupled to non-Hermitian spin chains and interacting ultracold Fermi gases, we find that approaching exceptional points can either enhance or strongly suppress decoherence, depending on the balance between Hermitian and non-Hermitian system-environment couplings. In particular, when these couplings are comparable, decoherence is dramatically suppressed at exceptional transitions. We trace this behavior to the distinct response of the environmental ground state near non-Hermitian degeneracies and demonstrate the robustness of this effect across multiple models. Finally, we show that the predicted suppression of decoherence is directly observable on current digital quantum simulation platforms. Our results establish exceptional points as a concrete mechanism for suppressing decoherence and identify non-Hermitian criticality as a new avenue for coherence control in open quantum systems and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Rivin</p>
            <p>We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$. We test Aaronson's conjecture that $|\perm(X)|^2$ is asymptotically lognormal for Gaussian~$X$: it is plausible for the complex Ginibre and GOE ensembles, but appears to fail for GUE and real Ginibre, where the $\alpha$-stable tails prevent convergence. Anti-concentration, however, holds for all Gaussian ensembles and is more robust than for Haar unitaries. Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[ \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12})) = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. We also study the geodesic forom the identity to the DFT matrix.</p>

            <p>Classical computations inherently require energy dissipation that increases significantly as the reliability of the computation improves. This dissipation arises when transitions between memory states are not balanced by their time-reversed counterparts. While classical memories exhibit a discrete set of possible time-reversal symmetries, quantum memory offers a continuum. This continuum enables the design of quantum memories that minimize irreversibility. As a result, quantum memory reduces energy dissipation several orders of magnitude below classical memory.</p>

            <p>In 1996, Hatano and Nelson proposed a non-Hermitian lattice model containing an imaginary Peierls phase [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 570-573 (1996)], which subsequent analyses revealed to be an instance of a new class of topological systems. Here, we experimentally realize a continuum analog to this model containing an imaginary gauge potential using a homogeneous spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Non-Hermiticity is introduced by adding tunable spin-dependent loss via microwave coupling to a subspace with spontaneous emission. We demonstrate that the resulting Heisenberg equations of motion for position and momentum depend explicitly on the system's phase-space distribution. First, we observe collective nonreciprocal transport in real space, with a "self-acceleration" that decreases with the BEC's spatial extent, consistent with non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We then examine localized edge states: the relatively strong interactions in our BEC suppress the formation of topological edge states, yielding instead highly excited states localized by an interplay between self-acceleration and wavefunction spreading. Finally, we confirm that our non-Hermitian description remains valid at all times by comparing to a multi-level master-equation treatment.</p>

It is commonly assumed that their classical description corresponds to a coherent state, so any deviation would signal genuinely quantum nature of gravity.

For GW150914, we estimate the squeezing parameter to be $\sim 10^{-4}$. We find that gravitational waves from binary black holes are well described by a coherent state.</p>

            <p>We use the framework of $\textit{fixed-point BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.</p>

            <p>The electromagnetic Green's function is a crucial ingredient for the theoretical study of modern photonic quantum devices, but is often difficult or even impossible to calculate directly. We present a numerically efficient framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information science, with profound implications for computing, communication, and metrology. Nuclear scattering processes, dominated by rich spin-dependent interactions, offer a natural platform for generating complex spin entanglement. Here, using proton-proton scattering as a quantum laboratory, we report the emergence of a near-pure Bell-triplet state at a laboratory energy of 151 MeV and a center-of-mass scattering angle of 90 degrees, with the spin amplitude a transition operator connecting two different Bell states. In contrast to the low-energy singlet state governed by the Pauli principle and the S-wave dominance, this second maximally entangled state is directly shaped by tensor forces beyond leading-order chiral effective field theory, providing a distinct quantum-information signature for realistic nuclear forces. These findings, invisible to traditional scattering observables, establish proton-proton scattering as a robust source of triplet entanglement and pave the way for next-generation nuclear Bell tests.</p>

By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</p>

            <p>We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.</p>

            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p>

            <p>We introduce the Krylov distribution $\mathcal{D}(\xi)$, a static Krylov-space diagnostic that characterizes how inverse-energy response is organized in Hilbert space. The central object is the resolvent-dressed state $(H-\xi)^{-1}|\psi_0\rangle$, whose decomposition in the Krylov basis generated from a reference state defines a normalized distribution over Krylov levels. Unlike conventional spectral functions, which resolve response solely along the energy axis, the Krylov distribution captures how the resolvent explores the dynamically accessible subspace as the spectral parameter $\xi$ is varied. Using asymptotic analysis, exact results in solvable models, and numerical studies of an interacting spin chain, we identify three universal regimes: saturation outside the spectral support, extensive growth within continuous spectra, and sublinear or logarithmic scaling near spectral edges and quantum critical points. We further show that fidelity susceptibility and the quantum geometric tensor admit natural decompositions in terms of Krylov-resolved resolvent amplitudes.</p>

            <p>We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.</p>

            <p>We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.</p>

            <h2>Resource-Adaptive Teleportation Under Imperfect Entanglement: A Code-Puncturing Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Saad Abouamer, Jaron Skovsted Gundersen, Søren Pilegaard Rasmussen, Petar Popovski</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation is a foundational protocol for sending quantum information through entanglement distribution and classical communication. Assuming ideal classical communication, the reliability of quantum teleportation is limited by the fidelity of the shared EPR pairs. This reliability can be improved through two mechanisms: entanglement purification and quantum error correction (QEC). Using both techniques in concert requires flexible QEC rates, since purification alters the structure of errors induced by imperfect-EPR teleportation, and fixed-rate codes cannot be uniformly effective across purification regimes or reliability targets. In this work, we supplement purification with punctured QEC codes, providing a family of code variants that can be adapted to error-channel characteristics and reliability targets. Punctured codes improve teleportation reliability across a broader range of purification regimes, enabling target reliability to be met without hardware-level code switching. This is corroborated by numerical results, showing that different punctured codes achieve the lowest logical error probability in different operating regimes, and that selecting among them reduces logical error relative to fixed-rate encoded teleportation. This reduction relaxes the requirement on the initial EPR fidelity or purification needed to achieve a target reliability. Overall, puncturing enables adaptation to varying entanglement conditions and reliability requirements while reusing a single stabilizer structure.</p>

            <h2>Challenge-Response Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Application to Quantum-Assisted Authentication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jawaher Kaldari, Saif Al-Kuwari</p>
            <p>Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research direction that integrates quantum information processing into reinforcement learning frameworks. While many existing QRL studies apply quantum agents to classical environments, it has been realized that the potential advantages of QRL are most naturally explored in environments that exhibit intrinsically quantum characteristics, where the agent's observations and interactions arise from quantum processes. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning environment formulated as a challenge-response task with hidden information. In the proposed environment, Alice encodes a classical bit into the parameters of a quantum circuit, while Bob, with a trained reinforcement learning agent, interacts with a limited number of quantum state copies to infer the hidden bit. The agent must select measurement strategies and decide when to terminate the interaction under explicit resource constraints. To study the solvability of the proposed environment, we consider three agents: a purely classical agent, a lightweight hybrid agent and a deep hybrid agent. Through experiments, we analyze the trade-off between inference accuracy and quantum resource consumption under varying interaction penalties. Our results show that the lightweight hybrid agent achieves reliable inference using as few as two quantum state copies, outperforming both the classical baseline and the deep hybrid agent in highly resource-constrained regimes. We further evaluate robustness under realistic quantum noise models and discuss the relevance of the proposed environment for security-oriented applications, including quantum-assisted authentication.</p>

            <h2>Quantum logic control and entanglement in hybrid atom-molecule arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Zhang, Sara Murciano, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Ran Finkelstein</p>
            <p>Polar molecules, with their rich internal structure, offer immense potential for fundamental physics, quantum technology, and controlled chemistry. However, their utilization is currently limited because of slow and imperfect state detection and weak dipolar interaction, limiting fast and large-scale entanglement generation. We propose and analyze a scheme for quantum logic control and measurement-based state preparation in a hybrid platform of polar molecules and neutral atoms. The method leverages fast, high-fidelity atom-molecule gates and high-fidelity atomic ancilla measurements to overcome the common challenges in molecule-only platforms, while preserving their diverse structural advantages. The proposed atom-molecule controlled-phase gate is based on resonant dipole-dipole exchange between a molecular rotational transition and an atomic Rydberg transition, rendering it three orders of magnitude faster than any direct molecule-molecule entangling gate. We further study several applications of our scheme including the preparation of molecular GHZ states for quantum enhanced precision measurements, the preparation of exotic molecular qudit states with topological order, and measurement-altered criticality. Our scheme is applicable to any polar molecule. It expands the paradigm of quantum logic control and paves the way to large-scale molecular entangled states. More generally, it highlights a concrete hybrid quantum system in which each qubit is utilized in an optimal way and where the measurement-based approach can yield a significant advantage in near-term devices.</p>

            <h2>Equilibrium thermometry in the multilevel quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tabitha Doicin, Luis A. Correa, Jonas Glatthard, Andrew D. Armour, Gerardo Adesso</p>
            <p>The temperature sensitivity of a probe in equilibrium can be gauged by its thermal quantum Fisher information (QFI). It is known that probes exhibiting degeneracy in their energy-level structure can achieve larger sensitivities, while probes with a more uniform spectrum may remain sensitive over a broader temperature range. Here, we study the thermometric performance of a multilevel quantum Rabi model in which two well-separated atomic manifolds of near-degenerate levels couple to a single cavity mode. We generalise the standard quantum Rabi treatment in the adiabatic regime to find an approximate closed-form expression for the thermal QFI. We then characterise two complementary limits. On the one hand, a large dark-state manifold (dark-manifold saturation) produces a robust peak in thermal sensitivity due to bright--dark population transfer. Such increase in sensitivity is further maximised at an intermediate light--matter coupling strength. Maximising instead the number of bright states (bright-manifold saturation) generates a broadband thermal response that becomes increasingly stable under random light--matter couplings as the number of levels is increased. The rich spectral structure of our cavity-QED model thus makes it a versatile and sensitive equilibrium thermometer over a broad range of temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Floquet implementation of a 3d fermionic toric code with full logical code space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshito Watanabe, Bianca Bannenberg, Simon Trebst</p>
            <p>Floquet quantum error-correcting codes provide an operationally economical route to fault tolerance by dynamically generating stabilizer structures using only two-body Pauli measurements. But while it is well established that stabilizer codes in higher spatial dimensions gain additional levels of intrinsic robustness, higher-dimensional Floquet codes have hitherto been explored only in limited scope. Here we introduce a 3d generalization of a Floquet code whose instantaneous stabilizer group realizes a 3d fermionic toric code, while crucially preserving all three logical qubits throughout the entire measurement sequence. One central ingredient is the identification of a 3d lattice geometry that generalizes the features of the Kekulé lattice underlying the 2d Hastings-Haah code - specifically, a structure where deleting any one edge color yields a two-color subgraph that decomposes into short, closed loops rather than homologically nontrivial chains. This loop property avoids the collapse of logical information that plagues naive sequential two-color measurement schedules on many 3d lattices. Although, for our lattice geometry, a simple 3-round cycle that sequentially measures the three types of parity checks does not expose the full error syndrome set, we show that one can append a measurement sequence to extract the missing syndromes without disturbing the logical subspace. Beyond code design, 3d tricoordinated lattice geometries define a family of 3d monitored Kitaev models, in which random measurements of the non-commuting parity checks give rise to dynamically created entangled phases with nontrivial topology. In discussing the general structure of their underlying phase diagrams and, in particular, the existence of certain quantum critical points, we again make a connection to the general preservation of logical information in time-ordered Floquet protocols.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning in cloud environments requires protecting sensitive data while enabling remote computation. Here we demonstrate the first realistic implementations of a perfectly-secure quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) scheme applied to quantum neural networks (QNN). Using efficient Clifford+$T$ decomposition, we implement quantum convolutional neural networks for two complementary scenarios: (i) reverse delegated training, where encrypted data from multiple providers trains a user's network via federated aggregation; (ii) private inference, where users process encrypted data with remote quantum networks. Moreover, analysis of server circuit privacy reveals probabilistic model protection through Pauli gate concealment. These results establish perfectly-secure QHE as a practical framework for multi-party quantum machine learning.</p>

            <p>Packages capable of supporting large arrays of high-coherence superconducting qubits are vital for the realisation of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the necessary high-throughput metrology required to optimise fabrication and manufacturing processes. We present a wafer-scale packaging architecture supporting over 500 qubits on a single 3-inch die. The package is engineered to suppress parasitic RF modes, and to mitigate material loss through simulation-informed design while managing differential thermal contraction to ensure robust operation at millikelvin temperatures. System-level heat-load calculations from a large wiring payload show this package may be operated in commercial dilution refrigerators. Measurements of the qubits loaded into the package show median $T_1$, $T_{2e} \sim 100~\mu$s ($\sim$100 qubits) alongside readout with median fidelity of 97.5% (54 qubits) and a median qubit temperature of 36 mK (54 qubits). These results validate the performance of these packages and demonstrate that large-scale integration can be achieved without compromising device performance. Finally, we highlight the utility of these packages as a tool for high throughput feedback on qubit figures of merit over large sample sizes, allowing identification of performance outliers in the tails of the coherence distribution, a critical capability for informing fabrication and manufacture of high-quality quantum qubits and quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum metrology with partially accessible chaotic sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshita Sharma, Sayan Choudhury, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>Most quantum metrology protocols harness highly entangled probe states and globally accessible measurements to surpass the standard quantum limit. However, it is challenging to satisfy these requirements in realistic many-body sensors. We demonstrate that both of these constraints can be overcome in quantum chaotic sensors. Crucially, we establish that even in the presence of partial measurement accessibility, chaotic dynamics enables initial unentangled states to exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information, $I_{\alpha}$ with time. In the weakly chaotic regime, we identify spin-coherent states placed at the edge of the regular islands in the mixed classical phase space as optimal initial states for enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, in the strongly chaotic regime, $I_{\alpha}$ is insensitive to the choice of the initial state. Notably, quantum-enhanced sensitivity is achieved even when a very low fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the qubits are accessible. These results establish quantum chaos as a robust resource for quantum-enhanced sensing under realistic accessibility constraints on accessibility.</p>

            <h2>Weighted graph states as a resource for quantum metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. J. Alexander, Ş. K. Özdemir, M. S. Tame</p>
            <p>Quantum metrology exploits quantum mechanical effects to increase the precision of measurements of physical quantities. A wide variety of applications are currently being developed for scientific and technological purposes, however, most research relies on the use of highly entangled resource states that are challenging to generate and control in a given physical system. Here, we study the use of weighted graph states as more accessible resources for quantum metrology, which yield a favorable precision beyond the classical limit, approaching the Heisenberg limit. We find a notable robustness to variation in weights and less challenging weight requirements compared to standard graph states, which require a maximal weight at all edges. Both of these aspects reduce the practical demands in a physical setup, with the latter implying significantly less entanglement is required to gain a quantum advantage in metrology. We study the quantum Fisher information and optimized estimator variance of two identified sub classes of weighted graph states for an arbitrary number of N qubits, providing analytical forms and investigating their scaling. Our work opens up opportunities for using weakly entangled states in quantum-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Steady States for Lindblad Equations beyond Time-Independence: Classification, Uniqueness and Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hironobu Yoshida, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>We present a rigorous and comprehensive classification of the asymptotic behavior of time-quasiperiodic Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equations under the assumption of Hermitian jump operators. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schrödinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schrödinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems. Our framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for controlling dissipative quantum systems in a time-dependent manner.</p>

            <h2>Stronger Welch Bounds and Optimal Approximate $k$-Designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Castellano, Dmitry Grinko, Sadra Boreiri, Nicolas Brunner, Jef Pauwels</p>
            <p>A fundamental question asks how uniformly finite sets of pure quantum states can be distributed in a Hilbert space. The Welch bounds address this question, and are saturated by $k$-designs, i.e. sets of states reproducing the $k$-th Haar moments. However, these bounds quickly become uninformative when the number of states is below that required for an exact $k$-design. We derive strengthened Welch-type inequalities that remain sharp in this regime by exploiting rank constraints from partial transposition and spectral properties of the partially transposed Haar moment operator. We prove that the deviation from the Welch bound captures the average-case approximation error, hence characterizing a natural notion of minimum achievable error at fixed cardinality. For $k=3$, we prove that SICs and complete MUB sets saturate our bounds, making them optimal approximate 3-designs of their cardinality. This leads a natural variational criterion to rule out the existence of a complete set MUBs, which we use to obtain numerical evidence against such set in dimension $6$. As a key technical ingredient, we compute the complete spectrum of the partially transposed symmetric-subspace projector, including multiplicities and eigenvectors, which may find applications beyond the present work.</p>

            <p>Pauli channels are widely used to describe errors in quantum computers, particularly when noise is shaped via Pauli twirling. A common assumption is that such channels admit a Markovian generator, namely a Pauli-Lindblad model with non-negative rates, but the validity of this assumption has not been systematically examined. Here, using CP-indivisibility as our criterion for non-Markovianity, we study multi-qubit Pauli channels from a single snapshot of the dynamics. We find that while the generator always has the same structure as the standard Pauli-Lindblad model, the rates may be negative or complex. We show that random Pauli channels are almost always non-Markovian, with the probability of encountering a negative rate converging doubly exponentially to unity with the number of qubits. For physically motivated noise models shaped by Pauli twirling, including single-qubit over-rotations and two-qubit amplitude damping errors, we find that negative rates are generic, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. We generalize probabilistic error amplification and cancellation to non-Markovian generators, and quantify the sampling overhead introduced by negative and complex rates. Experiments on superconducting qubits confirm that allowing negative rates in the learned noise model yields more accurate predictions than restricting to non-negative rates.</p>

            <h2>Magic and Wormholes in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valérie Bettaque, Brian Swingle</p>
            <p>Any quantum state is fully specified by the expectation values of a complete set of Hermitian operators. For a system of Majorana fermions, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, this set of observables can be taken to be all possible strings of Majorana fermion operators. The expectation values of these fermion strings in a thermal state depend erratically on the microscopic couplings that specify the SYK Hamiltonian, and we study their statistical properties directly in the thermodynamic limit using path integral techniques. When the underlying SYK Hamiltonian is chaotic, we find that these expectation values are well-modeled as real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance that we compute. In contrast, for the integrable variant of SYK, we find that the expectation values are actually non-Gaussian. We then use these results to study measures of magic in the SYK thermal state, including the robustness of magic and the stabilizer Rényi entropy. We also show that our results can be quantitatively reproduced with a dual gravity calculation in the chaotic case at sufficiently low temperature. In this dual gravity model the variance of a given microscopic operator string is related to a wormhole geometry stabilized by a massive particle which is dual to the operator string. Our results thus provide a concrete and quantitative setting in which to study the relationship between randomness, wormholes, and closed universes as well as a holographic dual of quantum magic.</p>

The recently introduced information lattice instead provides an observable-independent way to identify where and at which scale information is contained in quantum lattice models. Here, we use it to study the difference between the metallic and insulating regime of one-dimensional tight-binding chains. We find that the information per scale follows a power law in metals at low temperature and that Friedel-like oscillations are visible in the information lattice. At high temperature or in insulators at low temperature, the information per scale decays exponentially. Thus, the information lattice is a useful tool for analyzing the metal-insulator transition.</p>

The theory is demonstrated in a broad class of Floquet bipartite lattices, unveiling unique topological criticality of non-Hermitian Floquet origin.

The corresponding entanglement entropy is captured via quantum extremal surfaces (QES), which holographically be computed by a surface optimization algorithm based on ``Surface Evolver''. We focus on both connected and disconnected configurations of the quantum entanglement wedge (Q-EW) in the AdS$_3$ bulk and analyze the finite corrections to the BMI. Our numerical results reveal a phase transition of the BMI as the separation between two subregions increases. Furthermore, we find that the BMI can naturally be decomposed into two distinct components: a geometric term arising from the areas of the quantum extremal surfaces, and a correction term resulting from bulk quantum fields within the Q-EW. Interestingly, the geometric contribution always exceeds the total BMI, indicating a negative correction from the bulk matter fields. This negativity can be understood as the result of subtracting a greater contribution from quantum fields in the connected Q-EW than in the disconnected one. We also reproduce the negative contribution of bulk quantum fields to BMI within a random tensor network (RTN) toy model of double holography. Modeling the bulk as a highly mixed state entangled with a large bath leads to a volume-law bulk entropy. In the large bond-dimension limit, the geometric part of the BMI remains non-negative, while the bulk entropy contribution becomes non-positive when the Q-EWs merge.</p>

            <p>We introduce a real-parameter refinement of the classical integer hierarchies underlying Schmidt number, block-positivity, and $k$-positivity for maps between matrix algebras. Starting from a compact family of $\alpha$-admissible unit vectors ($\alpha\in[1,d]$), we define closed cones $\mathsf K_\alpha$ of bipartite positive operators that interpolate strictly between successive Schmidt-number cones, together with their dual witness cones. Via the Choi--Jamiołkowski correspondence this yields a matching filtration of map cones $\mathsf P_\alpha$, recovering the usual $k$-positive/$k$-superpositive classes at integer parameters and complete positivity at the top endpoint. Two results show that the fractional levels capture genuinely new structure. First, we prove a \emph{fractional Kraus theorem}: $\alpha$-superpositive maps are precisely the completely positive maps admitting a Kraus decomposition whose Kraus operators satisfy an explicit singular-value (Ky--Fan) constraint, extending the classical rank-$k$ characterization. Second, for non-integer $\alpha$ the cones $\mathsf P_\alpha$ fail stability under CP post-composition, highlighting a sharp structural transition away from the integer theory. Finally, we derive sharp thresholds on canonical symmetric families (including the depolarizing ray and the isotropic slice), turning familiar stepwise criteria into continuous, computable profiles.</p>

            <p>Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.</p>

            <p>We study a variant of the Haldane honeycomb model that has non-reciprocal hoppings between the next-nearest neighbours. The system on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings(ER) in the spectrum. The ERs act as Berry-curvature flux tubes i.e the Berry curvature is non-zero only inside the ERs. The system on a cylinder having zig-zag boundaries (and transverse momentum $k_x$) hosts edge-states that have zero group velocity at $k_x=\pi$ and are therefore `non-chiral'. The edge states undergo a bifurcation transition at an exceptional point(EP)in the BZ and delocalise into the bulk. As the non-reciprocity is increased, the bulk states that are approaching each other are converted into pairs of EPs due to non-Hermiticity. As the non-reciprocity is further increased, there is a `Russian doll'-like nested proliferation of pairs of EPs, leading to an EP-cascade. The proliferation of EPs takes place only at specific values of the non-hermiticity parameter, leading to a step-like structure in the EP-pair density when plotted as a function of non-Hermiticity. Further, using wave packet dynamics, we find a tunable regime where the non-chiral edge states can be dynamically stabilised for large timescales. The `self-acceleration' term in the equations of motion tends to diffuse the wave packets into the bulk, thus making them `ephemeral edge states'. But we find that for small non-hermiticity, the edge localisation is stabilised until late times for sufficiently wider wave packets. Thus, we have brought forth an intriguing phenomenology of the exceptional phase of the non-reciprocal Haldane model, which may bear direct relevance for systems such as disordered Kitaev honeycomb model, wherein such ERs have been predicted.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying confinement, topological order, and exotic quantum matter. In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.</p>

            <h2>Heisenberg-limited Bayesian phase estimation with low-depth digital quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Su Direkci, Ran Finkelstein, Manuel Endres, Tuvia Gefen</p>
            <p>Optimal phase estimation protocols require complex state preparation and readout schemes, generally unavailable or unscalable in many quantum platforms. We develop and analyze a scheme that achieves near-optimal precision up to a constant overhead for Bayesian phase estimation, using simple digital quantum circuits with depths scaling logarithmically with the number of qubits. We find that for Gaussian prior phase distributions with arbitrary widths, the optimal initial state can be approximated with products of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with varying number of qubits. Using local, adaptive measurements optimized for the prior distribution and the initial state, we show that Heisenberg scaling is achievable and that the proposed scheme outperforms known schemes in the literature that utilize a similar set of initial states. For an example prior width, we present a detailed comparison and find that is also possible to achieve Heisenberg scaling with a scheme that employs non-adaptive measurements, with the right allocation of copies per GHZ state and single-qubit rotations. We also propose an efficient phase unwinding protocol to extend the dynamic range of the proposed scheme, and show that it outperforms existing protocols by achieving an enhanced precision with a smaller number of additional atoms. Lastly, we discuss the impact of noise and imperfect gates.</p>

            <h2>Asymptotic quantification of entanglement with a single copy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Lami, Mario Berta, Bartosz Regula</p>
            <p>Despite the central importance of quantum entanglement in quantum technologies, the understanding of the optimal ways to exploit it is still beyond our reach, and even measuring entanglement in an operationally meaningful way is prohibitively difficult. Here we study two fundamental tasks in the processing of entanglement: entanglement testing, which is a quantum state discrimination problem concerned with entanglement detection in the many-copy regime, and entanglement distillation, concerned with purifying entanglement from noisy entangled states. We introduce a way of benchmarking the performance of distillation that focuses on the best achievable error rather than its yield in the asymptotic limit. When the underlying set of operations used for entanglement distillation is the axiomatic class of non-entangling operations, we show that the two figures of merit for entanglement testing and distillation coincide. We solve both problems by proving a generalised quantum Sanov's theorem, enabling the exact evaluation of asymptotic error rates of composite quantum hypothesis testing. We show in particular that the asymptotic figure of merit is given by the reverse relative entropy of entanglement, a single-letter quantity that can be evaluated using only a single copy of a quantum state -- a distinct feature among measures of entanglement that quantify the optimal performance of information-theoretic tasks.</p>

            <p>The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions resulting in entangled particle content across these sub-regions. However accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The array response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that vacuum photon content from non-perturbative changes of the boundary conditions and therefore distinct spatial sub regions of the vacuum causes subtle frequency shifts that are accessible to sub-wavelength atom array platforms. This novel approach for probing vacuum particle content stems from the unique ability to create coherent dynamics of superpositions of transmissive and reflective states providing a quantum enhanced platform for observing vacuum particle creation from highly non-perturbative boundary condition changes of the electromagnetic field vacuum.</p>

            <p>We investigate the performance of an adiabatic evolution protocol when initialized from a Gibbs state at finite temperature. Specifically, we identify the diagonality of the final state in the energy eigenbasis, as well as the difference in energy and in energy variance with respect to the ideal adiabatic limit as key benchmarks for success and introduce metrics to quantify the off-diagonal contributions. Provided these benchmarks converge to their ideal adiabatic values, we argue that thermal expectation values of observables can be recovered, in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. For the transverse-field Ising model, we analytically establish that these benchmarks converge polynomially in both the quasi-adiabatic evolution time $T$ and system size. We perform numerical studies on non-integrable systems and find close quantitative agreement for the off-diagonality metrics, along with qualitatively similar behavior in the energy convergence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Saha</p>
            <p>The dynamics of a discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) can be realized within a purely classical interacting particle system composed of some boxes and a large but finite number of balls, and can, in principle, be implemented in a tabletop experimental setting. The distribution of the balls evolves under stochastic, occupation-dependent update rules at each lattice site, producing quantum-walk dynamics without invoking a wavefunction. The update parameters are fixed by the parameters of coin and shift operations of the DTQW. This framework naturally yields a generalized active spin model and provides a minimal lattice-based microscopic understanding of the emergence of quantum-like dynamics in active matter systems. This interdisciplinary approach connects the classical models to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyejung H. Jee, Florian J. Curchod, Mafalda L. Almeida</p>
            <p>We introduce a systematic method for constructing polytope approximations to the quantum set in a variety of device-independent quantum random number generation (DI-QRNG) protocols. Our approach relies on two general-purpose algorithms that iteratively refine an initial outer-polytope approximation, guided by typical device behaviour and cryptographic intuition. These refinements strike a balance between computational tractability and approximation effectiveness. By integrating these approximations into the probability estimation (PE) framework [Zhang et al., PRA 2018], we obtain significantly improved certified entropy bounds in the finite-size regime. We test our method on various bipartite and tripartite DI-QRNG protocols, using both simulated and experimental data. In all cases, it yields notably higher entropy rates with fewer device uses than the existing techniques. We further extend our analysis to the more demanding task of randomness amplification, demonstrating major performance gains without added complexity. These results offer an effective and ready-to-use method to prove security-with improved certified entropy rates-in the most common practical DI-QRNG protocols.

            <p>The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is fundamentally bounded by environmental decoherence. Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of nonadaptive experimental protocols limits temporal precision and can average out rapid features of the underlying dynamics. Here, we overcome this temporal-resolution limit by two orders of magnitude using a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) powered classical controller that adaptively and continuously tracks the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. We report events in which the relaxation time switches by nearly an order of magnitude over timescales of just tens of milliseconds, rather than minutes or hours as previously reported. Our real-time Bayesian estimation protocol estimates relaxation times within a few milliseconds, close to the decoherence timescale itself. Our statistical analysis further suggests that some of these fast fluctuations arise from two-level systems switching at rates up to 10 Hz, four orders of magnitude faster than earlier reports. These results redefine the timescales relevant for calibration in superconducting quantum processing units, establish a reference for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening, and improve our understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.</p>

The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.</p>

In this work, we propose the first complete set of transformation rules for reversible circuits, comprising five fundamental rules: any two equivalent reversible circuits can be transformed into each other using the rules. To prove the completeness, a canonical circuit representation for reversible functions is introduced, and we show that every reversible function is computed by a unique reversible circuit in the canonical form, and any reversible circuit can be transformed into its canonical form by applying the rules.</p>

            <p>A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements.</p>

            <h2>Geodesics of Quantum Feature Maps on the Space of Quantum Operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Vlasic</p>
            <p>This manuscript rigorously displays how the Riemannian structure of a point cloud--taking the manifold hypothesis--impacts the encoded subspace of quantum gates, exhibiting a direct effect of data on quantum circuits. Selecting a scheme to encode real-world data onto a quantum circuit, or quantum feature map, is an essential step in quantum machine learning. There have been many proposed encoding schemes and proposed techniques to test the efficacy of a map. However, very few techniques address how the data is 'deformed' when mapped to quantum state space--complex projective space--or the state of quantum operators--the Lie group of (special) unitary operators--and the potential downstream effects on an algorithm. This paper takes the assumption that a point cloud is a smooth Riemannian manifold and establishes a rigorous computational/theoretical framework to study how an encoding scheme deforms this geometry once mapped to the space of quantum operators, $\SU(2^N)$. Since the Riemannian manifold structure of the codomain of a quantum feature map has yet to be formalized, this rigorous framework is required to ensure the validity of analysis. Using a ground-up approach, we mathematically establish a Riemannian geometry for a general class of Hamiltonian quantum feature maps--which describes the vast majority of encoding methods--that are induced from a given Euclidean embedded manifold. We then establish analytic and computational tangible forms for curvature, volume, frames and coframes, and harmonic maps, which is the main tool for deformation analysis. Interestingly, the form of vector fields, and by extension, the form of covector fields, shows the interconnection between the change of a path on the real embedded manifold influences the change of a path in the respective subspace of special unitary operators, revealing the effect data has on a quantum circuit.</p>

            <p>Quantum pseudo-telepathy games, such as the Mermin-Peres magic square and the doily game, theoretically allow players to win with unit probability when using entangled quantum strategies. We quantitatively characterize the quantum advantage in these games and compare it with violations of two Bell inequalities: the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and the Collins-Gisin inequalities. The analysis is restricted to two families of two-qubit states: modified Werner states and Bell-diagonal states. For each case, we identify and quantify the regions of quantum state space that exhibit either a quantum advantage or a Bell inequality violation, relative to the set of all entangled states. Within these families, the doily game captures a larger fraction of entangled states than the Mermin-Peres magic square game, though both are significantly more limited than the regions associated with Bell inequality violations. Although both approaches are fundamentally linked to quantum contextuality, our analysis of the examined two-qubit state families indicates that Bell inequalities are more effective at revealing entanglement, even if pseudo-telepathy games offer a more intuitive and conceptually appealing perspective.</p>

Specifically, in a multichain system, we first achieve tunable topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is selected by the permutation sequence. We then extend this to two particles, observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially entangled NOON states whose properties are dictated by the permutation sequence. Our work establishes an alternative pathway for exploring non-Abelian topology applied to quantum science and technology, enabled by the unique protection of time-dependent symmetry.</p>

            <p>Quantum-circuit implementations of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) can provide an efficient route to model graph-based algorithms. However, constructing circuits that faithfully reproduce CTQW dynamics across arbitrary graphs remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Laplacian partitioning algorithm (LPA) that enables an efficient and scalable quantum-circuit realization of CTQWs on random graphs. A common algorithm to simulate a general graph (of size $N = 2^n$ for $n$ qubits) on a quantum circuit is based on Pauli decomposition of the graph Hamiltonian, which can yield $O(4^n)$ terms, and require $O(N^2\log N)$ time for coefficient computation. In contrast, our LPA uses $O(2^n)$ terms, in $O(N^2)$ time. Our circuit provides a graph-agnostic framework for CTQWs, implemented via a Trotter-Suzuki product formula and confirming error scaling consistent with theoretical Trotter error bounds. To further test the circuit performance, we study the localization behavior of the CTQW. In our case, localization originates from Laplacian spectral degeneracies rather than disorder (Anderson-type), and our circuit faithfully reproduces these localization phenomena and spectral structure for a random graphs with high accuracy.</p>

Unlike conventional approaches that treat beam steering and timing estimation independently, a unified spatio temporal model is developed that links user position uncertainty to the Cramer Rao lower bound of the synchronization error. The framework incorporates key physical impairments, including multipath dispersion, non Gaussian detector jitter, and spatially correlated localization errors. Through analytical modeling and extensive simulations, we show that the proposed system exhibits graceful performance degradation under heavy tailed positioning uncertainty and remains stable in the presence of multipath induced bias. Using realistic single photon detector parameters, the results indicate that synchronization accuracy below $10$ picoseconds can be maintained across a wide range of operating conditions. This level of precision provides a scalable foundation for quantum enabled indoor wireless networks.</p>

In this work, we investigate methods to enhance the measurement fidelity of flux qubits via a quantum flux parametron-mediated readout scheme. Through theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we analyze the impact of different measurement bases on fidelity in single-qubit and coupled two-qubit systems. For single-qubit systems, we show that energy bases consistently outperform flux bases in achieving higher fidelity. In coupled two-qubit systems, we explore two measurement models: sequential and simultaneous measurements, both aimed at reading out a single target qubit. Our results indicate that the highest fidelity can be achieved either by performing sequential measurement in a dressed basis over a longer duration or by conducting simultaneous measurement in a bare basis over a shorter duration. Importantly, the sequential measurement model consistently yields more robust and higher fidelity readouts compared to the simultaneous approach. These findings quantify achievable fidelities and provide valuable guidance for optimizing measurement protocols in emerging quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rylan Malarchick</p>
            <p>Numerical optimal control (GRAPE) can in principle discover pulse shapes that suppress all coherent gate error to machine precision. But when does that capability actually matter? We present a systematic comparison of Gaussian, DRAG, and GRAPE pulses for single-qubit gates on a three-level transmon model parameterized by IQM Garnet hardware ($T_1 = 37\,\mu$s, $T_2 = 9.6\,\mu$s,$\alpha/2\pi = -200$ MHz), with the explicit goal of identifying the regimes where numerical optimization provides genuine practical advantage over analytical methods. Our central finding is that properly calibrated DRAG already operates near the decoherence floor. At 20 ns gate time, GRAPE eliminates all coherent error ($1 - F < 10^{-15}$), but DRAG achieves $1 - F = 4.9 \times 10^{-4}$ in coherent error alone,and $8.4 \times 10^{-4}$ under full decoherence -- only $1.2\times$ above GRAPE's decoherence-limited performance. More surprisingly,DRAG is \emph{more robust} than GRAPE to qubit frequency detuning (minimum fidelity 0.990 vs.\ 0.931 over $\pm 5$ MHz), the dominant calibration uncertainty in charge-noise-limited transmons. GRAPE retains superior amplitude robustness (minimum fidelity 0.994 vs.\ 0.990) and provides the only route to guaranteed zero coherent error, which matters at short gate times ($\lesssim 15$ ns) where perturbative corrections break down. These results lead to concrete calibration guidance: (1) properly calibrated DRAG is sufficient for gate times $\gtrsim 20$ ns on hardware with $T_2/T \gtrsim 500$, (2) GRAPE is necessary at short gate times or when targeting error rates well below the decoherence floor, and (3) robust optimal control incorporating frequency uncertainty should be used when detuning is the dominant noise source. We decompose the full error budget (coherent, $T_1$, $T_2$, control noise) and provide the open-source QubitPulseOpt framework for reproducing all results.</p>

In this study, we analyze simultaneous gate operations on multiple qubits using microwaves transmitted via a single cable in a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme. By employing rectangular control microwave pulses, we reveal the contribution of drive frequency spacing to gate fidelity. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal microwave signals suppress interference in simultaneously driven qubits, thereby ensuring high gate fidelity. Additionally, we provide design guidelines for key parameters, including pulse length, number of multiplexed microwave signals, and rotation angle, to achieve precise qubit operations. Our findings enable a scalable FDM-based microwave control scheme suitable for quantum processors with a large number of qubits.</p>

            <p>Active matter denotes a system of particles immersed in an external environment, from which the particles extract energy continuously in order to perform directed motion. Extending the paradigm of active matter to a quantum framework requires an appropriate description of the environment. In this work, we consider a driven quantum particle undergoing noise and dissipation, with external driving exhibiting characteristics of classical activity. We model the non-unitary dynamics with time-local master equations and analyze the particle motion at different time scales for different forms of the master equations, satisfying different criteria. We systematically compare predictions on the dynamics of particle trajectories and thereby we uncover how the particle motion evolves under the interplay of quantum effects, dissipation, and active-like dynamics. These results are essential for guiding possible experiments aimed at realizing quantum analogues of classical active systems.</p>

            <h2>Systems that saturate the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ole Sönnerborn</p>
            <p>We provide a complete characterization of all finite-dimensional quantum systems that saturate the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit at arbitrary Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity. Employing a purification-based approach, we prove that mixed-state saturation occurs precisely when three structural criteria are fulfilled: the state's support is confined to the sum of two energy eigenspaces (the ground level and a single excited level); each eigenvector of the state with nonzero weight is a fixed superposition of one ground- and one excited-state energy eigenvector (determined by the minimizer of the objective function identified by Giovannetti et al.) and all such eigenvectors evolve in mutually orthogonal subspaces. These requirements impose a strict rank bound, ruling out saturation by any faithful state. For quantum bits, we derive a purity-resolved and tight Margolus-Levitin bound that reduces to the pure-state result in the limit of unit purity. Through a time-reversal argument, we further extend the dual Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit to mixed states and establish the corresponding saturation conditions.</p>

            <h2>Trade-offs between Quantum and Classical Resources in the Linear Combination of Unitaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Wada, Hiroyuki Harada, Yasunari Suzuki, Yuuki Tokunaga, Naoki Yamamoto, Suguru Endo</p>
            <p>The randomized linear combination of unitaries (LCU) method with many applications to early fault-tolerant quantum computing algorithms has been proposed. This quantum algorithm computes the same expectation values as the original, fully coherent LCU algorithm using a shallower quantum circuit with a single ancilla qubit, at the cost of a quadratically larger sampling overhead. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm intermediate between the original and randomized LCU that manages the trade-off between the sampling overhead and circuit complexity. Our algorithm divides the set of unitary operators into several groups and then randomly samples LCU circuits from these groups to evaluate the target expectation value. Notably, we reveal that across all grouping strategies, the mechanism of the sampling overhead reduction can be solely characterized by a metric we call the reduction factor. Moreover, we analytically prove an underlying monotonicity of the reduction factor in the group size: larger group sizes entail smaller sampling overhead. Finally, our framework enables a more flexible algorithmic design by systematically yielding intermediate implementations of LCU-based algorithms; we provide intermediate implementations of non-Hermitian dynamics simulation, ground-state property estimation, and quantum error detection. Besides, we demonstrate this principle by deriving intermediate trade-off scaling in sample complexity and ancillary space for quantum linear system solver.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and Lee-Yang theory for quantum XYZ and clock models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian-Yi Gu, Gaoyong Sun</p>
            <p>Lee-Yang theory offers a unifying framework for understanding classical phase transitions and dynamical quantum phase transitions through the analysis of partition functions and Loschmidt echoes. Recently, this framework is extended to characterize quantum phase transitions of quantum Ising models by introducing the concepts of non-Hermitian parity-symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros. Here, we generalize the theory by studying a broad class of quantum models, including the XY, the XXZ, the XYZ, and the $\mathbb{Z}_p$ clock models in one dimension, subject to a complex magnetic field. For the XY, XXZ and XYZ models, we find that the complex field breaks parity symmetry and induces oscillations of the ground state between the two parity sectors, giving rise to fidelity zeros within the ordered phases. For the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, the complex field splits the real part of the ground-state energy between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sectors ($q=1,2$), while preserving the degeneracy within the charged sector. Fidelity zeros arise only after projecting out one of the charged sectors. In contrast, for the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ clock model, the ground state oscillates between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sector ($q=2$), which directly gives rise to fidelity zeros. Finite-size scaling of these zeros yields critical exponents in full agreement with analytical predictions, demonstrating that this approach is applicable not only to the Ising model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, but also to more general Heisenberg-type models and systems with higher discrete symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Boltzmann to Lindblad: Classical and Quantum Approaches to Out-of-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Giordano, Giuseppe Florio, Giuseppe Puglisi, Fabrizio Cleri, Ralf Blossey</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems play a central role in contemporary nanoscale technologies, including molecular electronics, quantum heat engines, quantum computation and information processing. A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems.</p>

            <p>Optical quantum computing, as well as quantum communication and sensing technology based on quantum correlations are in preparation. These require photodiodes for the detection of about 10^16 photons per second with close to perfect quantum efficiency. Already the radiometric calibration is a challenge. Here, we provide the theoretical description of the quantum radiometric calibration method. Its foundation is squeezed light and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, making it an example of quantum metrology based on quantum correlations. Unlike all existing radiometric calibration methods, ours is in situ and provides both the detection efficiency and the more stringent quantum efficiency directly for the measurement frequencies of the user application. We calibrate a pair of the most efficient commercially available photodiode at 1550 nm to a system detection efficiency of (97.20 + 0.37)% using 10-dB-squeezed vacuum states. Our method has great potential for significantly higher precision and accuracy, but even with this measurement, we can clearly say that the available photodiode efficiencies for 1550 nm are unexpectedly low, too low for future gravitational wave detectors and for optical quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>LiDMaS: Architecture-Level Modeling of Fault-Tolerant Magic-State Injection in GKP Photonic Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computation in photonic architectures requires efficient preparation of high-fidelity logical magic states under realistic constraints of finite squeezing and photon loss. An architecture-level study of logical $T$-gate magic-state preparation in Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP)-encoded photonic qubits is presented using a repeat-until-success (RUS) injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. A lightweight density-matrix simulator based on standard numerical linear algebra is employed, mapping finite squeezing to effective logical dephasing, incorporating logical depolarizing noise, and treating photon loss as a heralded erasure process. Parameter sweeps are performed over squeezing values from $8$ to $16$~dB, baseline loss probabilities between $0.01$ and $0.03$, and surface-code distances $d=1,3,5,$ and $7$. Across this regime, RUS success probabilities exceed $0.94$, with average injection overhead between $1.15$ and $1.20$ rounds per successful attempt. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach $F_{\mathrm{log}} \approx 0.77$--$0.80$, exhibiting weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but strong monotonic dependence on squeezing. Sensitivity analysis identifies finite squeezing as the dominant continuous error source, while loss primarily impacts heralded failure rates. Phase-boundary diagrams determine minimum squeezing requirements to achieve success probability $\ge 0.95$ and logical fidelity $\ge 0.79$ as a function of code distance, providing quantitative design guidance for scalable photonic fault-tolerant architectures.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entanglement determines the strength and range of interactions in many-body quantum systems. Yet, it is hard to evaluate it, due to the complex structures of quantum states. Here, we introduce a generic method to quantify the k <= N-partite entanglement of an N-particle system, by maximizing an arbitrary bipartite entanglement measure within subsystems of size up to k. The resulting classification of multipartite states captures their experimental cost: creating a k-partite entangled state requires at least k-1 two-particle entangling gates. Further, we analytically calculate the newly defined k-partite entanglement of formation, which generalizes an important bipartite entanglement measure, in several classes of states, including the W states of any dimension.</p>

            <h2>The Finite Geometry of Breaking Quantum Secrets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Péter Lévay, Metod Saniga</p>
            <p>Using a finite geometric framework for studying the pentagon and heptagon codes we show that the concepts of quantum secret sharing and contextuality can be studied in a nice and unified manner. The basic idea is a careful study of the respective $2+3$ and $3+4$ tensorial factorizations of the elements of the stabilizer groups of these codes. It is demonstrated in detail how finite geometric structures entailing a specific three-qubit (resp. four-qubit) embedding of binary symplectic polar spaces of rank two (resp. three), corresponding to these factorizations, govern issues of contextuality and entanglement needed for a geometric understanding of quantum secret sharing. Using these results for the $(3,5)$ and $(4,7)$ threshold schemes explicit secret breaking protocols are derived. Our results hint at a novel geometric way of looking at contextual configurations.</p>

            <h2>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Rivin</p>
            <p>We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$. We test Aaronson's conjecture that $|\perm(X)|^2$ is asymptotically lognormal for Gaussian~$X$: it is plausible for the complex Ginibre and GOE ensembles, but appears to fail for GUE and real Ginibre, where the $\alpha$-stable tails prevent convergence. Anti-concentration, however, holds for all Gaussian ensembles and is more robust than for Haar unitaries. Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[ \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12})) = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. We also study the geodesic forom the identity to the DFT matrix.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing Trainability of Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial Circuit Born Machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin Shen, Susanne Pielawa, Vedran Dunjko, Hao Wang</p>
            <p>Instantaneous quantum polynomial quantum circuit Born machines (IQP-QCBMs) have been proposed as quantum generative models with a classically tractable training objective based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and a potential quantum advantage motivated by sampling-complexity arguments, making them an exciting model worth deeper investigation. While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.</p>

            <p>We connect three distinct lines of research that have recently explored extensions of the classical LOCAL model of distributed computing: A. distributed quantum computing and non-signaling distributions [e.g. STOC 2024], B. finitely-dependent processes [e.g. Forum Math. Pi 2016], and C. locality in online graph algorithms and dynamic graph algorithms [e.g. ICALP 2023]. We prove new results on the capabilities and limitations of all of these models of computing, for locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs). We show that all these settings can be sandwiched between the classical LOCAL model and what we call the randomized online-LOCAL model. Our work implies limitations on the quantum advantage in the distributed setting, and we also exhibit a new barrier for proving tighter bounds. Our main technical results are these: 1. All LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution with locality $O(1)$. This answers an open question by Holroyd [2024], and also presents a new barrier for proving bounds on distributed quantum advantage using causality-based arguments. 2. In rooted trees, if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log \log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model (or any of the weaker models, such as quantum-LOCAL), we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. One of many implications is that in rooted trees, $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in quantum-LOCAL is not stronger than $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in classical LOCAL.</p>

The impact of this interplay on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar gases, and in particular its connection with universal turbulent behavior, remains highly unexplored. Here, upon considering a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate of dysprosium atoms being dynamically driven across the supersolid-superfluid phase transition and vice versa, we unveil the emergence of a robust nonequilibrium quasi-steady state. This state displays self-similar momentum distributions exhibiting algebraic decay at large momenta, with scaling exponents supporting the existence of wave turbulence. We demonstrate that supersolidity sustaining higher-lying momenta, associated with the roton minimum, promotes the development of turbulence. Our results provide a stepping stone toward unraveling and exploiting turbulent and self-similar behavior in anisotropically long-range interacting quantum gases amenable in current experiments.</p>

            <p>Transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs) have emerged as a promising alternative to exceptional points (EPs) for non-Hermitian sensing, providing square-root frequency splitting without the eigenbasis collapse and associated noise amplification that limit EP sensors. However, existing treatments of TPDs remain fragmented, lacking a unified theoretical framework, systematic figures of merit, or design principles for practical implementation. Here, we develop a comprehensive theory of two-dimensional TPDs that clarifies their relationship to EPs, maps their locations in parameter space, and provides analytic figures of merit for sensor design. We validate our theory using a tunable cavity-magnonics platform with in situ control of mode frequency, dissipation, and complex coupling via an effective synthetic gauge field. Our platform enables systematic exploration of six representative EP-TPD configurations spanning PT-symmetric, anti-PT-symmetric and anyonic-PT-symmetric regimes. Crucially, we show that TPDs, unlike EPs, retain square-root splitting even under nuisance parameter drift through generalized transmission extrema degeneracies (TEDs). We further identify specific robust TPD configurations that minimize the impact of nuisance drift. These findings establish a unified theoretical and experimental framework for TPD-based non-Hermitian sensing.</p>

            <p>From gravitational-wave detection, protein force microscopy, to exploration of quantum-classical boundaries, many anticipated discoveries in fundamental science require improving measurement sensitivity limits. Through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, mechanical dissipation sets the acoustic noise for this limit. Yet, even in high-purity crystals, the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the acoustic loss remain poorly understood. Tension-induced dissipation dilution offers a route to ultralow acoustic loss, but is challenging to implement in crystalline materials including single-crystal diamond. Here we realize a strain-engineered diamond nanomechanical platform using a liquid-assisted van der Waals self-assembly process that harnesses intrinsic surface forces to apply tensile stress exceeding 1 GPa. At cryogenic temperatures these resonators achieve quality factors beyond 10 billion (intrinsic material quality factors beyond 100 million). This exceptional coherence turns them into a sensitive probe for residual dissipation, elucidating three distinct two-level-system channels and one topological dissipation channel from a surface superfluid helium film. Our work shows how advancing mechanical coherence opens access to new regimes of physics in hybrid quantum systems, precision metrology, and condensed-matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Uniform semiclassical observable error bound of Trotter-Suzuki splitting: a simple algebraic proof</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Fang, Conrad Qu</p>
            <p>Efficient simulation of the semiclassical Schrödinger equation has garnered significant attention in the numerical analysis community. While controlling the error in the unitary evolution or the wavefunction typically requires the time step size to shrink as the semiclassical parameter $h$ decreases, it has been observed -- and proved for first- and second-order Trotterization schemes -- that the error in certain classes of observables admits a time step size independent of $h$. In this work, we explicitly characterize this class of observables and present a new, simple algebraic proof of uniform-in-$h$ error bounds for arbitrarily high-order Trotterization schemes. Our proof relies solely on the algebraic structure of the underlying operators in both the continuous and discrete settings. Unlike previous analyses, it avoids Egorov-type theorems and bypasses heavy semiclassical machinery. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of uniform-in-$h$ observable error bounds for Trotterization in the semiclassical regime that relies only on algebraic structure, without invoking the semiclassical limit.</p>

            <p>Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological phase transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase, a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. By analyzing domain-wall configurations in the SSH chain, we further show how subsystem tuning allows one to distinguish genuine topological zero-energy eigenstates from trivial localized states. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Mark M. Wilde, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>Conic programs arise broadly in physics, quantum information, machine learning, and engineering, many of which are defined over sparse graphs. Although such problems can be solved in polynomial time using classical interior-point solvers, the computational complexity scales unfavorably with graph size. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving conic programs, including quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) and semidefinite programs (SDPs). We encode primal variables via the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables via the probability mass function of a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. A primal-dual solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting the primal variables so that related observables are expressed in a banded form, enabling efficient measurement. The proposed framework is applied to the OPF problem, a large-scale optimization problem central to the operation of electric power systems. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</p>

These results establish FRG as a powerful nonperturbative tool for quantum impurity problems in regimes inaccessible to conventional approaches, with direct implications for mesoscopic experiments.</p>

We investigate the effectiveness of a quantum-inspired approach in alleviating this curse, both for solving PDEs and making data-driven predictions. We achieve this goal by treating both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS) encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm for accurate long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling logarithmically with both spatial and temporal resolution. We also demonstrate an application where both methods can be combined for cheap and accurate prediction of long-term dynamics. This research highlights the role of tensor networks in developing effective, interpretable models that bridge the gap between numerical methods and data-driven approaches.</p>

            <h2>Thermal nature of confining strings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Grieninger, Dmitri E. Kharzeev, Eliana Marroquin</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks for Cross-Sectional Equity Return Prediction: A Comparative Benchmark Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi-Sheng Chen, Xinyu Zhang, En-Jui Kuo, Rong Fu, Qiuzhe Xie, Fan Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning offers a promising pathway for enhancing stock market prediction, particularly under complex, noisy, and highly dynamic financial environments. However, many classical forecasting models struggle with noisy input, regime shifts, and limited generalization capacity. To address these challenges, we propose a Quantum Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (QTCNN) that combines a classical temporal encoder with parameter-efficient quantum convolution circuits for cross-sectional equity return prediction. The temporal encoder extracts multi-scale patterns from sequential technical indicators, while the quantum processing leverages superposition and entanglement to enhance feature representation and suppress overfitting. We conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study on the JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange dataset and evaluate predictions through long-short portfolio construction using out-of-sample Sharpe ratio as the primary performance metric. QTCNN achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.538, outperforming the best classical baseline by approximately 72\%. These results highlight the practical potential of quantum-enhanced forecasting model, QTCNN, for robust decision-making in quantitative finance.</p>

            <p>Single-photon detection underpins a wide range of emerging photonic technologies, from quantum information processing and secure communications to photon-starved biomedical imaging. Among the available detector technologies, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) combine high detection efficiency, low noise, and excellent timing resolution, making them a leading platform for photon-counting applications. However, despite decades of materials and fabrication research, detector performance has never been shown to match theoretical performance expectations. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from its typical, suboptimal operation, to a regime limited only by material quality, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector that redistribute current across its width to achieve its peak performance. This technique not only reduces the dark count rate by ten orders of magnitude, but also enables future detectors to overcome the Pearl limit for device width, paving the way for arbitrarily large detectors. We show operation at this intrinsic performance limit for devices up to 0.1 mm wide, and also demonstrate near-unity internal detection efficiency (IDE) at a wavelength of 4um for a 20um-wide detector--a factor of 20 wider than the current state of the art.</p>

            <p>A generalization for the quantum information retrieval protocol recently illustrated by Verlinde and van der Heijden for evaporating black holes is provided to inclusions of type III von Neumann factors. The physical interest of such scenario arises in Quantum Field Theory, where local algebras are type III von Neumann algebras. The formula obtained can be easily interpreted in terms of the statistical dimension of superselection sectors in the case of black holes undergoing charge evaporation, thanks to the index-statistics theorem, leading to a thermodynamic interpretation. A constraint on the values of the index leads to a final remark about the quantization of the charge emitted by the black hole during the evaporation process.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Zhang, Wei Zeng, Ming Lian</p>
            <p>Bell states and quantum teleportation play important roles in the study of quantum information and computation. But a comprehensive theoretical research on both of them remains to be performed. This work aims to investigate important algebraic properties of generalized Bell states as well as explore topological features of quantum teleportation. First, the basis theorem and basis group are introduced to explain that the extension of a generalized Bell basis by a unitary matrix is still an orthonormal basis. Then a twist operator is defined to make a connection between a generalized multiple qubit Bell state and a tensor product of two qubit Bell state. Besides them, the Temperley--Lieb algebra, the braid group relation and the Yang--Baxter equation are used to provide a topological diagrammatic description of generalized Bell states and quantum teleportation. It turns out that our approach is able to present a clear illustration of relevant quantum information protocols and exhibit a topological nature of quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum computing with anyons is fault tolerant</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anasuya Lyons, Benjamin J. Brown</p>
            <p>In seminal work (arXiv:quant-ph/9707021) Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computing (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arXiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:quant-ph/0001108, arXiv:0707.1889), whereby logic gates of a quantum computer are conducted by creating, braiding and fusing anyonic particles on a two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arXiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for direct first-principles simulation of electron-nuclear dynamics on a first-quantized real-space grid. Our algorithm achieves best-in-class efficiency for block-encoding the pre-Born-Oppenheimer molecular Hamiltonian by harnessing the linear scaling of swap networks for implementing the quadratic number of particle interactions, while using a novel alternating sign implementation of the Coulomb interaction that exploits highly optimized arithmetic routines. We benchmark our approach for a series of scientifically and industrially relevant chemical reactions. We demonstrate over an order-of-magnitude reduction in costs compared to previous state-of-the-art for the $\rm NH_3+BF_3$ reaction, achieving a Toffoli cost of $8.7\times10^{9}$ per femtosecond using $1362$ logical qubits (system + ancillas). Our results significantly lower the resources required for fault-tolerant simulations of photochemical reactions, while providing a suite of algorithmic primitives that are expected to serve as foundational building blocks for a broader class of quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>Resolving signals with closely spaced frequencies is central to applications in communications, spectroscopy and sensing. Recent results have shown that quantum sensing protocols can exhibit superresolution, the ability to discriminate between spectral lines with arbitrarily small frequency separation. Here, we revisit this problem from the perspective of quantum control theory, utilizing the filter function formalism to derive general, analytic conditions on quantum control protocols for achieving superresolution. Building on these conditions, we develop an optimal control framework, the utility of which is demonstrated through numerical identification of superresolution control protocols in the presence of realistic, experimentally-relevant constraints. We further extend our results to entangled initial states and assess their potential advantage. Our approach is broadly applicable to a wide variety of quantum sensing platforms, and it provides a systematic path to discover novel protocols that surpass conventional resolution limits in these systems.</p>

            <p>Maxwell's demon elucidates the value of information in thermodynamics, using measurement and feedback: he evolves an equilibrated gas into a nonequilibrium state, from which one might extract work. The demon can evolve the system farther from equilibrium, on average, if the particles obey Bose-Einstein statistics than if they are distinguishable. We experimentally support this decade-and-a-half-old prediction by comparing indistinguishable with distinguishable photons. We use a fully programmable linear-optics platform, whose local photon statistics were shown recently to behave thermally. Our demon nondestructively measures the number of photons in a subset of the modes. Guided by the outcome, he conditionally interchanges the measured and unmeasured modes. This interchange creates a positive temperature difference between a mode in a particular subset and a mode in the other. The temperature difference is greater, on average, if the photons are indistinguishable. This result bolsters a long-standing prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics. Additionally, this work suggests a thermodynamic means of weakly validating boson-sampling platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum nonreciprocity from qubits coupled by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenghao Zhang, Qingtian Miao, G. S. Agarwal</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical study of quantum nonreciprocity induced via a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in an otherwise achiral, waveguide quantum electrodynamics. Using the full quantum master equation and input-output formalism for two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide and driven by a coherent field, we show that an engineered DMI enables strong nonreciprocity in an otherwise reciprocal system, with tunable behavior governed by driving strength, detunings, and phase of the DMI. Using it not only demonstrates nonreciprocal transmission but also demonstrates nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and photon bunching. The system can end up in a pure state as certain decohering channels do not participate. The pure state leads to power-independent perfect transparency. Conditions are derived and depend on the propagation phase, the relative detuning of the two qubits, and the exchange interaction. At these pure-state points, the steady-state entanglement is reciprocal and admits a closed-form expression; away from them, phase control generates strong entanglement nonreciprocity. The DMI also reshapes photon statistics, redistributing two-photon correlations and shifting superbunching from transmission (no DMI) to reflection at finite DMI. These results establish DMI as a versatile resource for engineering nonreciprocity, transparency, entanglement, and photon correlations in waveguide QED, enabling isolators, routers, and superbunching light sources without requiring chiral waveguides.</p>

            <h2>Multi-ion entangling gates mediated by spectrally unresolved modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Modesto Orozco-Ruiz, Florian Mintert</p>
            <p>Entangling interactions between distant qubits can be mediated via an additional degree of freedom. In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity. Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string. Through several explicit examples, we highlight the advantages over existing magnetic-gradient schemes and show how gates on multiple ion pairs can be carried out simultaneously.</p>

            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has been developed to target near term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers as a method to find the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians. Unlike fully quantum algorithms such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), VQE based methods are hybrid algorithms that utilize both quantum and classical hardware to combat issues with the near term quantum hardware such as small numbers of available qubits and the decoherence of qubits. Different adaptations (flavors) of VQE have been implemented to combat these scalability issues on NISQ devices compared to standard VQE. These different flavors are modifications of the underlying VQE ansatz to reduce the computational workload on the quantum hardware. In this review we focus on 3 main areas related to VQE. The first focus is on flavors of VQE that fall under the categories of circuit complexity reduction, chemistry inspired ansatz, and extensions of VQE to excited states. The remaining portion of the review focuses on benchmarking the accuracy of VQE methods and an overview of the current state of quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Superradiant biphoton emission from atomic ensembles provides a powerful route to generating highly correlated quantum light, yet its microscopic physical origin has remained incompletely understood. In particular, it is often unclear how collective enhancement, spontaneous emission, and vacuum fluctuations jointly give rise to both paired biphoton generation and unavoidable unpaired background within a single, self-consistent framework. Here we present a fully quantum microscopic theory within a unified Heisenberg--Langevin--Maxwell framework that explicitly incorporates dissipation and quantum noise, thereby revealing the microscopic origin of superradiant biphoton emission in atomic ensembles. The theory provides a consistent description of parametric gain and unpaired noise within the same open-quantum-system framework and applies to both Doppler-free cold atomic ensembles and Doppler-broadened warm vapors. In the high-optical-depth regime, the coupled propagation equations admit analytical solutions, under which the biphoton dynamics rigorously reduce to an effective collective two-level emission process. Within this limit, the biphoton correlation time and spectral properties are shown to obey closed-form scaling relations governed by optical depth and excited-state decoherence. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of superradiant biphoton generation and clarify the fundamental role of vacuum fluctuations and dissipation in setting the brightness, pairing efficiency, and temporal structure of atomic biphoton sources, with direct relevance to quantum networking and atomic quantum interfaces.</p>

However, existing multiparty QBA protocols face challenges for large-scale deployment due to exponential communication complexity or reliance on complex multi-particle entanglement. To address this, we propose a multiparty circular QBA protocol that adopts a semi-decentralized architecture, leveraging circular message gathering and quantum digital signatures to achieve quadratic communication complexity and enhanced fault tolerance. Our protocol is experimentally feasible, requiring only weak coherent states, and is compatible with existing star-shaped quantum networks. Simulations conducted on a global satellite-to-ground network demonstrate that the protocol sustains high consensus rates among multiple users, even when employing different key generation protocols under realistic conditions.

Our protocol uses an approach where a state prepared at a tractable geometry is propagated along a discretized reaction coordinate using Procrustes-aligned orbital rotations and stabilized by engineered dissipative cooling. We show that for reaction paths satisfying a localized Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) drift condition in the strongly correlated regime, the algorithm prepares ground states of chemical systems with $N_o$ orbitals to an energy error $\epsilon_E$ with a total gate complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(N_o^{3}/\epsilon_E)$.

            <p>Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.</p>

            <p>Quantum subspace diagonalization and quantum Krylov algorithms offer a feasible, pre- or early-fault tolerant alternative to quantum phase estimation for using quantum computers to estimate the low-lying spectra of quantum systems. However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice. While we develop our approach in the context of quantum subspace diagonalization, the improved thresholding scheme we develop could be advantageous in any context where one must solve noisy, ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problems.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum computers and quantum networks require the combination of quantum processing nodes with efficient light-matter interfaces to distribute quantum information in local or long-distance quantum networks. Neutral-atom arrays have both been coupled to Rydberg states to enable high-fidelity quantum gates in universal processing architectures, and to optical cavities to realize interfaces to photons. However, combining these two capabilities and coupling atom arrays to highly excited Rydberg states in the mode of an optical cavity has been an outstanding challenge. Here we present a novel cavity-coupled Rydberg array that achieves this long-standing goal. We prepare, detect, and control individual atoms in a scalable optical tweezer array, couple them strongly to the optical mode of a high-finesse optical cavity and excite them in a controlled way to Rydberg states. We show that strong coupling to an optical cavity - demonstrated via the dispersive shift of the resonance of the cavity in presence of the atoms - and strong Rydberg interactions - demonstrated via the collective enhancement of Rydberg coupling in the atomic array - can be achieved in our setup at the same spatial location. Our presented experimental platform opens the path to several new directions, including the realization of quantum network nodes, quantum simulation of long-range interacting, open quantum systems and photonic-state engineering leveraging high-fidelity Rydberg control.</p>

            <p>Deterministic preparation of high-excitation Fock states is a central challenge in bosonic quantum information, with control complexity that generically explodes as the Hilbert space dimension grows. Here we introduce resonant subspace engineering (RSE), a protocol that analytically confines the infinite-dimensional bosonic dynamics to a two-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by an initial coherent state and the target state. State transfer then reduces to a geodesic rotation on a synthetic Bloch sphere, governed by resonance and phase-matching conditions we derive in closed form. For single Fock states, RSE achieves $O(n^{1/4})$ scaling in both evolution time and gate depth, showing a fundamental improvement over existing deterministic schemes. The construction generalizes to $K$-component superpositions via a $(K{+}1)$-dimensional invariant subspace with full $\mathrm{SU}(K{+}1)$ controllability, requiring only 3-5 iterations of operations for superpositions spanning photon numbers 70--100. RSE provides a scalable and analytically transparent framework for large-scale bosonic state engineering and gate synthesis across single- and multimode platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a "leaf typicality" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Quantum Low-Density Parity Check Codes and Non-Clifford Operations from Gauging Logical Gates via Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maine Christos, Chiu Fan Bowen Lo, Vedika Khemani, Rahul Sahay</p>
            <p>In this work, we introduce constructions for non-Abelian qLDPC codes obtained by gauging transversal Clifford gates using measurement and feedback. In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincaré duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus. We conclude by demonstrating that our gauging procedures enable magic state preparation via the measurement of logical Clifford gates. Consequently, our gauging constructions offer a protocol for performing non-Clifford operations on any qLDPC code.</p>

            <h2>Repulsive Gravitational Force as a Witness of the Quantum Nature of Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo L. Saldanha, Chiara Marletto, Vlatko Vedral</p>
            <p>We show that a single spatially superposed 'source' mass acting on a 'probe' matter wavepacket can reveal the quantum nature of the gravitational field. For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lead to repulsion, as the effect requires quantum interference of two distinct states of gravity. We also present a calculation in the Heisenberg picture under the formalism of weak values that illustrates how repulsion is achieved. Finally, we estimate the range of parameters (masses and the spatio-temporal extent of interference) for which the experiment is feasible.</p>

            <p>Certification is important to guarantee the correct functioning of quantum devices. A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative overlap. Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state. We introduce a measure of fidelity suitable for this setting and show several different ways to witness it, based on earlier proposals for measuring genuine multi-photon indistinguishability. We argue that a witness based upon the discrete Fourier transform is an optimal choice. We experimentally implement this witness and certify the fidelity of several multi-photon states.</p>

            <p>Machine learning techniques have proven to be effective in addressing the structure of atomic nuclei. Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a promising machine learning technique suitable for solving integro-differential problems such as the many-body Schrödinger problem. So far, there has been no demonstration of extracting nuclear eigenstates using such method. Here, we tackle realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction in momentum space, including models with strong high-momentum correlations, and demonstrate highly accurate results for the deuteron. We further provide additional benchmarks in coordinate space. We introduce an expression for the variational energy that enters the loss function, which can be evaluated efficiently within the PINNs framework. Results are in excellent agreement with proven numerical methods, with a relative error between the value of the predicted binding energy by the PINN and the numerical benchmark of the order of $10^{-6}$. Our approach paves the way for the exploitation of PINNs to solve more complex atomic nuclei.</p>

            <p>We identify fundamental limitations in machine learning by demonstrating that non-trivial mixed-state phases of matter are computationally hard to learn. Focusing on unsupervised learning of distributions, we show that autoregressive neural networks fail to learn global properties of distributions characterized by locally indistinguishable (LI) states. We demonstrate that conditional mutual information (CMI) is a useful diagnostic for LI: we show that for classical distributions, long-range CMI of a state implies a spatially LI partner. By introducing a restricted statistical query model, we prove that nontrivial phases with long-range CMI, such as strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, are hard to learn. We validate our claims by using recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer neural networks to learn the syndrome and physical distributions of toric/surface code under bit flip noise. Our findings suggest hardness of learning as a diagnostic tool for detecting mixed-state phases and transitions and error-correction thresholds, and they suggest CMI and more generally ``non-local Gibbsness'' as metrics for how hard a distribution is to learn.</p>

            <p>We construct a new nonlinear deformed Schrödinger structure using a nonlinear derivative operator which depends on a parameter $q$. This operator recovers Newton derivative when $q \rightarrow 1$. Using this operator we propose a deformed Lagrangian which gives us a deformed nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a nonlinear kinetic energy term and a standard potential $V(\vec{x})$. We analytically solve the nonlinear deformed Schrödinger equation for $V(\vec{x}) = 0$ and $q \simeq1$. This model has a continuity equation, the energy is conserved, as well as the momentum and also interacts with electromagnetic field. Planck relation remains valid and in all steps we easily recover the undeformed quantities when the deformation parameter goes to 1. Finally, we numerically solve the equation of motion for the free particle in any spatial dimension, which shows a solitonic pattern when the space is equal to one for particular values of $q$.</p>

            <p>The uncertainty principle constitutes a fundamental pillar of quantum theory, representing one of the most distinctive features that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes.</p>

            <p>Gravitational effects associated with black holes are widely believed to universally degrade quantum entanglement, with the loss of maximal entanglement being particularly severe and even irreversible for bosonic fields. In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state ($CL_4$) for fermionic fields in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations. Moreover, our results indicate that, within a relativistic framework, the $CL_4$ state constitutes a high-quality quantum resource with potential applications in relativistic quantum information processing, and may significantly improve the performance of such protocols.</p>

            <p>A hybrid quantum computing architecture combining quantum processors and quantum memory units allows for exploiting each component's unique properties to enhance the overall performance of the total system. However, superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, while spin ensembles require finite fields for control, creating a major integration challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the first experimental setup that satisfies these constraints and provides verified qubit stability. Our cryogenic setup comprises two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside a single dilution refrigerator: one hosting flux-tunable superconducting qubits and the other a spin ensemble equipped with a superconducting solenoid generating fields up to 50 mT. We show that several layers of Cryophy shielding and an additional superconducting aluminum shield suppress magnetic crosstalk by more than eight orders of magnitude, ensuring stability of the qubit's performance. Moreover, the operation of the solenoid adds minimal thermal load on the relevant stages of the dilution refrigerator.

            <p>Coherent control of two-level quantum systems is typically achieved using resonant driving fields, forming the basis for qubit operations. Here, we report a mechanism for inducing complete Rabi oscillations in monochromatically driven two-level quantum systems, when the drive frequency is much larger than the Larmor frequency of the qubit. This effect$\unicode{x2015}$Rabi oscillations induced by nonresonant geometric drive (RING)$\unicode{x2015}$requires that the control field is elliptical, enclosing a nonzero area per cycle. We illustrate the effect with numerical simulations, and provide an analytical understanding via a simple effective Hamiltonian obtained from Floquet theory and perturbation theory. We show that RING enables coherent oscillations without relying on resonant energy exchange, allows for high-pass noise filtering, provides access to non-Abelian phases in finite magnetic fields. We detail a realization in electrically driven spin-orbit qubits and argue that the RING mechanism enables amplification of the Rabi frequency using the same gate voltage amplitudes at higher drive frequencies. Our results broaden the landscape of quantum control techniques, by highlighting a pathway to achieving coherent oscillations under off-resonant driving conditions.</p>

Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators. Furthermore, the associated notion of an inner product is proposed, allowing for introduction of the Hilbert space. We illustrate these constructions with examples involving a Wilson loop and a dipole network.</p>

            <p>The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved Rényi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged Rényi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture.</p>

            <p>Projective measurements of collective observables can be employed to herald the preparation of entangled states of quantum systems, and the resulting conditional dynamics is usually handled by stochastic master equation (SME) for small systems, and by an approximate Gaussian-state formalism for large systems. In this work, we present an alternative technique by developing a stochastic variant of cumulant mean-field theory, benchmark it against an exact stochastic collective density matrix approach by the simulations of hundreds of identical two-level atoms. More importantly, we demonstrate its full power by studying the conditional spin squeezing of thousands of three-level atoms coupled strongly with an optical cavity subject to individual decay and dephasing, and by simulating the experimental protocol to reveal formation and detection of the spin squeezed state. The proposed technique might be further extended to study more exotic quantum-measurement effects of large quantum systems, such as deterministic spin squeezing with quantum feedback, spin squeezing of optical clock transitions, and retrodictive spin squeezing by posterior measurements, and so on.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a promising solution to protect current cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computers. As QKD transitions from laboratories to real-world applications, its implementation under various environmental conditions has become a pressing challenge. Major obstacles to practical QKD implementation are the loss of photons in the transmission media and the presence of extreme noise, which can severely limit long-range transmission. In this paper, we investigate the impact of extreme noise on QKD system parameters, including timing jitter, rate-dependent timing shifts, changes in effective detector dead time, and rate-dependent detection efficiency. Contrary to manufacturers' specifications, which assume these parameters to be constant, we demonstrate that these parameters exhibit significant variations in extreme noise conditions. We show that changes in these parameters play a key role in determining system performance in noisy environments. To address these nonidealities, we develop a model that adapts to detector-dependent timing distortions and recovery effects. In particular, our model is independent of source parameters and can be implemented using data from the detection unit. Our results show that the model enables reliable characterization and optimization of QKD performance under strong noise.</p>

In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status.</p>

            <p>We develop a method to search for the optimal code space, induced decay rates and control Hamiltonian to implement autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) for a general open quantum system. The system is defined by a free-evolution Lindbladian superoperator, which contains the free Hamiltonian and naturally occurring decoherence terms, as well as the control superoperators. The performance metric for optimization in our algorithm is the fidelity between the projector onto the code space and the same projector after Lindbladian evolution for a specified time. We use a gradient-based search to update the code words, induced decay matrix and control Hamiltonian matrix. We apply our algorithm to optimize AQEC codes for a variety of few-level systems. The four-level system with uniform decay rates offers a simple example for testing and illustrating the operation of our approach. The algorithm reliably succeeds in finding the optimal code in this case, while success becomes probabilistic for more complicated cases. For a five-level system with photon loss decay, the algorithm finds good AQEC codes, but these codes are not as good as the well-known binomial code. We use the binomial code as a starting point to search for the optimal code for a perturbed five-level system. In this case, the algorithm finds a code that is better than both the original binomial code and any other code obtained numerically when starting from a random initial guess. Our results demonstrate the promise of using computational techniques to discover and optimize AQEC codes in future real-world quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum thermodynamics in the Gaussian regime provides a promising framework for investigating the energetic role of quantum correlations, particularly in optical systems. In this work, we introduce an entropy-free criterion for entanglement detection in bipartite Gaussian states, rooted in a distinct thermodynamic quantity: ergotropy--the maximum extractable work via unitary operations. By defining the relative ergotropic gap, which quantifies the disparity between global and local ergotropy, we derive two independent analytical bounds that distinguish entangled from separable states. These bounds coincide for a broad class of quantum states, making the criterion both necessary and sufficient in such cases. Unlike entropy-based measures, our ergotropic approach captures fundamentally different aspects of quantum correlations and entanglement, particularly in mixed continuous-variable systems. We also extend our analysis beyond the Gaussian regime to certain non-Gaussian states and observe that Gaussian ergotropy continues to reflect thermodynamic signatures in entangled states, albeit with some limitations. These findings establish a direct operational link between entanglement and energy storage, offering an experimentally accessible approach to entanglement detection in continuous-variable optical platforms.</p>

            <p>We show how to perform measurement-based quantum computing on qudits (high-dimensional quantum systems) using alternative resource states beyond the cluster state. Estimating overheads for gate decomposition, we find that generalizing standard qubit measurement patterns to the qudit cluster state is suboptimal in most dimensions, so that alternative qudit resource states could enable enhanced computational efficiency. In these resources, the entangling interaction is a block-diagonal Clifford operation rather than the usual controlled-phase gate for cluster states. This simple change has remarkable consequences: the applied entangling operation determines an intrinsic single-qudit gate associated with the resource that drives the quantum computation when performing single-qudit measurements on the resource state. We prove a condition for the intrinsic gate allowing for the measurement-based implementation of arbitrary single-qudit unitaries. Furthermore, we demonstrate for prime-power-dimensional qudits that the complexity of the realization depends linearly both on the dimension and the Pauli order of the intrinsic gate. These insights also allow us to optimize the efficiency of the standard qudit cluster state by effectively mimicking more favorable intrinsic-gate structures, thereby reducing the required measurement depth. Finally, we discuss the required two-dimensional geometry of the resource state for universal measurement-based quantum computing. As concrete examples, we present multiple alternative resource states. In certain dimensions, we show the existence of resource states achieving optimal intrinsic gates, enabling more efficient measurement-based quantum information processing than the qudit cluster state and highlighting the potential of qudit stabilizer state resources for future quantum computing architectures.</p>

This ITE formulation provides a unified perspective on Grover's algorithm, its variants and extensions to widely used quantum subroutines including amplitude amplification and oblivious amplitude amplification. Specifically, the framework explains the choice of angles in the original Grover's algorithm and $\pi/3$-algorithm. It also motivates a new $\pi/2$-algorithm, for cases a modest failure probability is acceptable, that converges faster than the $\pi/3$-algorithm without overshooting. Our analysis further provides a link between ITE and quantum signal processing, which yields a new implementation of the fixed-point quantum search algorithm. Moreover, the ITE formulation can systematically reproduce widely-used subroutines in modern quantum algorithms, such as (oblivious) amplitude amplification. These results collectively establish a deeper understanding of Grover's algorithm and suggest a potential role for thermodynamics and geometry in quantum algorithm design.</p>

            <p>In quantum information and computation, the generation of entanglement through unitary gates remains a significant and active area of research. However, there are states termed as absolutely separable, from which entanglement cannot be created through any non-local unitary action. Thus, from a resource-theoretic perspective, non-absolutely separable states are useful as they can be turned into entangled states using some appropriate unitary gates. In this work, we propose an efficient method to detect non-absolutely separable states. Our approach relies on evaluating moments that can bypass the need for full state tomography, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. We then present several examples in support of our detection scheme. We also address a closely related problem concerning states whose partial transpose remains positive under any arbitrary non-local unitary action. Furthermore, we examine the effectiveness of our moment-based approach in the detection of quantum channels that are not absolutely separating, which entails the detection of resource preserving channels. Finally, we demonstrate the operational significance of non-absolutely separable states by proving that every such state can provide an advantage in a quantum-channel discrimination task.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos.

            <h2>Continuous-time quantum walk-based ansätze on neutral atom hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edric Matwiejew, Jonathan Wurtz, Jing Chen, Pascal Jahan Elahi, Tommaso Macri, Ugo Varetto</p>
            <p>Continuous-time quantum walks offer provable speedups for certain computational problems, yet translating these advantages to near-term hardware remains challenging. We present the first experimental demonstration of variational ansätze based on continuous-time quantum walks on an analog neutral-atom processor. For unentangled targets, we derive closed-form expressions for near-optimal control parameters that transfer directly to hardware with minimal calibration. Experiments on QuEra's Aquila processor provide the first observation of the super-quadratic convergence characteristic of efficient quantum walk algorithms, visible at low circuit depth, with theory predicting stronger speedups as hardware improves. For entangled targets, specifically symmetric superpositions in the Rydberg-blockaded subspace, we introduce an optimization protocol exploiting spectral properties of the walk dynamics. The required evolution time scales inversely with the spectral gap, offering an advantage over adiabatic protocols that scale to the square of the spectral gap. We demonstrate this scaling behavior on Aquila and verify that the prepared states are coherent superpositions via quench dynamics. This constitutes the first preparation of such symmetric entangled states on neutral-atom hardware. Our results establish a practical pathway from abstract quantum walk algorithms to analog quantum processors, demonstrating that the dynamics underlying their potential for super-quadratic quantum speedup are accessible on current devices.</p>

            <h2>Fast entangling gates on fluxoniums via parametric modulation of plasmon interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhao, Peng Xu, Zheng-Yuan Xue</p>
            <p>In superconducting quantum processors, exploring diverse control methods could offer essential versatility and redundancy to mitigate challenges such as frequency crowding, spurious couplings, control crosstalk, and fabrication variability, thus leading to better system-level performance. Here we introduce a control strategy for fast entangling gates in a scalable fluxonium architecture, utilizing parametric modulation of the plasmon interaction. In this architecture, fluxoniums are coupled via a tunable coupler, whose transition frequency is flux-modulated to control the inter-fluxonium plasmon interaction. A bSWAP-type interaction is activated by parametrically driving the coupler at the sum frequency of the plasmon transitions of the two fluxoniums, resulting in the simultaneous excitation or de-excitation of both plasmon modes. This strategy therefore allow the transitions between computational states and non-computational plasmon states, enabling the accumulation of conditional phases on the computational subspace and facilitating the realization of controlled-phase gates. By focusing on a specific case of these bSWAP-type interactions, we show that a simple drive pulse enables sub-100ns CZ gates with an error below $10^{-4}$. Given its operational flexibility and extensibility, this approach could potentially offer a foundational framework for developing scalable fluxonium-based quantum processors.</p>

This allows us to effectively model the problem using low-dimensional environment and apply recently developed powerful tools that yield optimal metrological protocols and fundamental metrological bounds for correlated-noise models.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asghar Ullah, Hasan Mermer, Melih Özkurt, Igor Lesanovsky, Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu</p>
            <p>Periodically driven quantum systems can function as highly selective parameter filters. We demonstrate this capability in a finite-size, three-qubit system described by the transverse-field Floquet Ising model. In this system, we identify a period-doubling (PD) dynamical phase that exhibits a stark asymmetry in metrological sensitivity to the magnetic field applied on the qubits and to the coupling strength between the qubits. The PD phase originates from $\pi$-pairing, where the initial state exhibits strong overlap with $\pi$-paired Floquet eigenstates, leading to robust period-doubled dynamics and enhanced metrological sensitivity. The analysis of quantum Fisher information reveals that the PD regime significantly enhances precision for estimating the Ising interaction strength while simultaneously suppressing sensitivity to the transverse magnetic field. Conversely, non-PD regimes are optimal for sensing the transverse field. This filtering effect is robust for larger system sizes and is quantifiable using experimentally accessible observables, such as magnetization and two-qubit correlations, via the classical Fisher information. Our work shows that distinct dynamical regimes in finite-size Floquet systems can be harnessed for targeted quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>Certified-Everlasting Quantum NIZK Proofs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil Pappu</p>
            <p>We study non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) for NP satisfying: 1) statistical soundness, 2) computational zero-knowledge and 3) certified-everlasting zero-knowledge (CE-ZK). The CE-ZK property allows a verifier of a quantum proof to revoke the proof in a way that can be checked (certified) by the prover. Conditioned on successful certification, the verifier's state can be efficiently simulated with only the statement, in a statistically indistinguishable way. Our contributions regarding these certified-everlasting NIZKs (CE-NIZKs) are as follows: - We identify a barrier to obtaining CE-NIZKs in the CRS model via generalizations of known interactive zero-knowledge proofs that satisfy CE-ZK. - We circumvent this by constructing CE-NIZK from black-box use of NIZK for NP satisfying certain properties, along with OWFs. As a result, we obtain CE-NIZKs for NP in the CRS model, based on polynomial hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) assumption. - In addition, we observe that the aforementioned barrier does not apply to the shared EPR model. We leverage this fact to construct a CE-NIZK for NP in this model based on any statistical binding hidden-bits generator, which can be based on LWE. The only quantum computation in this protocol involves single-qubit measurements of the shared EPR pairs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Süzen</p>
            <p>A transition to quantum chaos is characterized by a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} offers a pedagogically accessible framework for simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve across these transitions. Characterization of the transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap, with statistical uncertainty quantification that strengthens the robustness of the evidence for transitions. The transitions are identified as the {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, due to the shape of empirical spectral density, which depend on the tunable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE provide a valuable framework to study the {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of systems with tunable localization and disorder.</p>

            <h2>Scattering Cross Section Formula Derived From Macroscopic Model of Detectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashi Kaimal, Roderich Tumulka</p>
            <p>We are concerned with the justification of the statement, commonly (explicitly or implicitly) used in quantum scattering theory, that for a free non-relativistic quantum particle with initial wave function $\Psi_0(\boldsymbol{x})$, surrounded by detectors along a sphere of large radius $R$, the probability distribution of the detection time and place has asymptotic density (i.e., scattering cross section) $\sigma(\boldsymbol{x},t)= m^3 \hbar^{-3} R t^{-4} |\widehat{\Psi}_0(m\boldsymbol{x}/\hbar t)|^2$ with $\widehat{\Psi}_0$ the Fourier transform of $\Psi_0$. We give two derivations of this formula, based on different macroscopic models of the detection process. The first one consists of a negative imaginary potential of strength $\lambda>0$ in the detector volume (i.e., outside the sphere of radius $R$) in the limit $R\to\infty,\lambda\to 0, R\lambda\to \infty$. The second one consists of repeated nearly-projective measurements of (approximately) the observable $1_{|\boldsymbol{x}|>R}$ at times $\mathscr{T},2\mathscr{T},3\mathscr{T},\ldots$ in the limit $R\to\infty,\mathscr{T}\to\infty,\mathscr{T}/R\to 0$; this setup is similar to that of the quantum Zeno effect, except that there one considers $\mathscr{T}\to 0$ instead of $\mathscr{T}\to\infty$. We also provide a comparison to Bohmian mechanics: while in the absence of detectors, the arrival times and places of the Bohmian trajectories on the sphere of radius $R$ have asymptotic distribution density given by the same formula as $\sigma$, their deviation from the detection times and places is not necessarily small, although it is small compared to $R$, so the effect of the presence of detectors on the particle can be neglected in the far-field regime. We also cover the generalization to surfaces with non-spherical shape, to the case of $N$ non-interacting particles, to time-dependent surfaces, and to the Dirac equation.</p>

            <p>Quantum mechanics predicts that unobserved systems may exist in a superposition of states, yet measurement produces definite outcomes, a tension at the heart of the quantum-to-classical boundary. How the transformation between these opposing regimes unfolds as observation strength increases has remained experimentally unexplored. Here, by continuously tuning the measurement strength on a superconducting qubit, we reveal that measurement-dominated dynamics emerge not gradually but through three distinct transitions: coherent oscillations abruptly halt; the system then freezes near a stable quantum state; and finally enters the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger observation paradoxically slows relaxation. Decoherence, rather than washing out this structure, reorganizes it, inverting the order in which transitions appear and decoupling signatures that coincide in idealized models. These results establish that the route from quantum dynamics to measurement-dominated behavior unfolds in sharp transitions governed by the interplay between observation and environment.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Generation via test-time learning with large language models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adriano Macarone-Palmieri, Rosario Lo Franco</p>
            <p>Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For the 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorems to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.</p>

            <p>We report a normal-mode induced synchronization blockade in coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators under the influence of external drive. In this mechanism, the coupling hybridizes the oscillator modes into spectrally split normal modes. The destructive interference between the transitions to these modes blocks synchronization. We find that this blockade can be controlled simply by tuning the coupling strength and detuning allowing dynamic manipulation of quantum synchronization through collective mode dynamics. We analyze the phase-locking behaviour using perturbation analysis. Further, by deriving steady-state probability amplitudes we show how the energy redistribution and spectral splitting forms the basis of the blockade. Our results might provide new insights into how synchronization can be controlled in quantum systems.</p>

This self-organization has been extensively studied using the approximate Dicke model (truncating to two momentum states), as well as through numerical Gross-Pitaevskii simulations in one and two dimensions. Here, we perform a full mean-field analysis of the system, including all relevant atomic momentum states and the cavity field. We map out the steady-state phase diagram vs pump strength and cavity detuning, and provide an in-depth understanding of the instabilities that are linked to the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. We find and describe parameter regimes where mean-field predicts bistability, regimes where the dynamics form chaotic trajectories, instabilities caused by resonances between normal mode excitations, and states with atomic dynamics but vanishing cavity field.</p>

            <p>Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.</p>

Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p>Entanglement percolation aims at generating maximal entanglement between any two nodes of a quantum network by utilizing strategies based solely on local operations and classical communication between the nodes. As it happens in classical percolation theory, the topology of the network is crucial, but also the entanglement shared between the nodes of the network. In a network of identically partially entangled states, the network topology determines the minimum entanglement needed for percolation. In this work, we generalize the protocol to scenarios where the initial entanglement shared between each two nodes of the network is not the same but has some randomness. In such cases, we find that for classical entanglement percolation, only the average initial entanglement is relevant. In contrast, the quantum entanglement percolation protocol generally performs worse under these more realistic conditions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the interplay between genuine entanglement harvesting and communication mediated correlations for local particle detectors in expanding cosmological spacetimes. Focusing on a conformally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze how spacetime expansion induces interference between these two sources of entanglement when the detectors are in causal contact. We compare two physically distinct detector models: detectors whose spatial profile expands with the Universe, and detectors whose proper size remains fixed despite cosmological expansion. We find that the lack of time-reversal symmetry in cosmological settings generically leads to constructive or destructive interference between communication mediated correlations and harvested field correlations, dramatically affecting the entanglement that detectors can acquire. In particular, rapid expansion can suppress entanglement entirely for expanding detectors through destructive interference, even when both communication and field correlations are individually large, whereas detectors that maintain a fixed proper size remain capable of acquiring significant entanglement. Our results show that cosmological expansion qualitatively reshapes the balance between communication and harvesting, and that the detector internal cohesion (whether it expands with the Universe or not) plays a crucial role in determining whether detectors' entanglement can survive in rapidly expanding universes.</p>

            <p>Quantum operations with indefinite causal order (ICO) represent a framework in quantum information processing where the relative order between two events can be indefinite. In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation.</p>

            <p>Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $\omega_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\lambda C_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\lambda\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\omega_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\lambda$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\Delta(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\Delta$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.</p>

            <p>We develop a general theoretical framework for characterizing stable quantum resources between microwave and optical modes in the dynamics of multipartite hybrid quantum systems with intermediary modes. The effective Hamiltonian for microwave-optical (MO) squeezing is formulated via strong interactions in the microwave-intermediary-optical hybrid system, and based on which rigorous solutions for the dynamics of MO entanglement and quantum steering are derived analytically. Remarkably, it is found that stable MO quantum resources can survive in the unsteady evolution beyond the steady one, and the unsteady evolution can exhibit the enhanced quality over the limit of quantum resources in the steady-state case. Furthermore, the stable MO entanglement as well as one-way and two-way quantum steerings are efficiently controllable by modulating the effective coupling strength. The validity of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to the typical models of electro-optomechanical and cavity optomagnomechanical hybrid systems.</p>

            <h2>Photon Anti-Bunching and Quantum Non-Gaussianity from High-Harmonic Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Theidel, Mackrine Nahra, Ilya Karuseichyk, Houssna Griguer, Mateusz Weis, Hamed Merdji</p>
            <p>Quantum technologies are powered by platforms to generate complex non-classical states of matter or light to realize applications. We investigate the non-classical properties of high-harmonic generation in semiconductors, an emerging photonic platform. Measuring the click statistics of three double-digit orders, we evaluate witness operators to certify the non-classicality of the generated states. We show that higher-order harmonics driven by a coherent laser are squeezed and entangled. The properties of the emission are well retrieved with an entangled Gaussian state model, obtained by numerical state optimization to multiple observables. Additionally, we perform inter-order heralded measurements to engineer the quantum state of the emission. The heralded states have distinct properties, showing anti-bunched photon statistics. Further, we witness the generation of a quantum non-Gaussian state, a resource highly relevant for quantum information. With this, we establish high-harmonic generation as a platform for generating quantum optical resources.</p>

            <h2>Recirculating Quantum Photonic Networks for Fast Deterministic Quantum Information Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil Grovn, Matias Bundgaard-Nielsen, Jesper Mørk, Dirk Englund, Mikkel Heuck</p>
            <p>A fundamental challenge in photonics-based deterministic quantum information processing is to realize key transformations on time scales shorter than those of detrimental decoherence and loss mechanisms. This challenge has been addressed through device-focused approaches that aim to increase nonlinear interactions relative to decoherence rates. In this work, we adopt a complementary architecture-focused approach by proposing a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that minimizes the duration of quantum information processing tasks, thereby reducing the requirements on nonlinear interaction rates. The RQPN consists of a network of all-to-all connected nonlinear cavities with dynamically controlled waveguide couplings, and it processes information by capturing a photonic input state, recirculating photons between the cavities, and releasing a photonic output state. We demonstrate the RQPN's architectural advantage through two examples: first, we show that processing all qubits simultaneously yields faster operations than single- and two-qubit decompositions of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. Second, we demonstrate implementations of a measurement-free correction for single-photon loss, achieving up to seven-fold speedups and significantly improved hardware efficiency relative to state-of-the-art architecture proposals. Our work shows that a single hardware-efficient recirculating architecture substantially reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates and quantum error correction, thereby lowering the barrier to experimental realizations of deterministic photonic quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>A promising quantum computing architecture comprises modules of superconducting quantum processors linked via optical channels using quantum transducers. As quantum transducer hardware improves, a need has arisen to understand the quantitative relationship between transducer-device characteristics and the strength of the resulting remote entanglement. Using Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate 2-to-1 and 3-to-1 entanglement distillation methods, our model maps transducer device performance up to system-level channel performance, thereby allowing the performance of remote entanglement approaches to be compared and optimized. We find the extreme photon loss (EPL) distillation protocol to be particularly high performing. Moreover, even without distillation, present-day transducers with added noise of photons are at the threshold of enabling remote Bell pairs with fidelities exceeding 50%. If the next generation of transducers can improve by 3 orders of magnitude in added noise, efficiency, and repetition rates, then they would allow for remote two-qubit gates achieving 99.7% fidelities at MHz rates. These results set practical targets for transducers to be ready for deployment into modular quantum computing systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of Ligand-like Molecules through Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization in Density Matrix Embedding Framework</h2>

            <p>The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.</p>

            <p>Efficient and bright single photon sources on photonic chips are key to scaling quantum technologies. Spontaneous four wave mixing in micro-ring resonators creates excellent narrowband and tunable photon sources. We experimentally demonstrate the optimization of heralding efficiency and brightness by tuning the coupling of the pump, signal and idler modes into the resonator whilst operating in a pulsed pump regime. We observe a maximum detected pair rate of over 93,000~coincidences per second in a moderately over-coupled regime, alongside a high intrinsic idler heralding efficiency of 97.87$\pm$8.97\% when operating close to maximal over-coupling. The measured dependence on coupling strength is in strong agreement with theoretical predictions, experimentally validating the predicted trade-off between brightness and heralding efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Sparsity: Quantum Block Encoding for Dense Matrices via Hierarchically Low Rank Compression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Tang, Jun Lai</p>
            <p>While quantum algorithms for solving large scale systems of linear equations offer potential speedups, their application has largely been confined to sparse matrices. This work extends the scope of these algorithms to a broad class of structured dense matrices arise in potential theory, covariance modeling, and computational physics, namely, hierarchically block separable (HBS) matrices. We develop two distinct methods to make these systems amenable to quantum solvers. The first is a pre-processing approach that transforms the dense matrix into a larger but sparse format. The second is a direct block encoding scheme that recursively constructs the necessary oracles from the HBS structure. We provide a detailed complexity analysis and rigorous error bounds for both methods. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of our approaches.</p>

            <h2>Protection of quantum steering ellipsoids in non-Markovian environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Jie Zhang, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>The quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) provides a geometric representation, within the Bloch picture, of all possible states to which one qubit can be steered through measurements performed on another correlated qubit. However, in most realistic settings, quantum systems are inevitably coupled to their surrounding environment, resulting in decoherence and the consequent degradation of the QSE. Here, by investigating how local dissipative environments coupled separately to each qubit affect the steering properties geometrized by the QSE within an exact non-Markovian framework, we find that the geometry of each party's QSE is closely tied to whether a bound state forms in the energy spectrum of the total qubit-environment system. We systematically examine the characteristics of QSEs under three distinct scenarios: two-sided bound states, one-sided bound states, and no bound state, revealing a diverse range of steering types. Our work establishes quantum reservoir engineering as a tunable strategy for protecting and controlling quantum steering in open systems, offering a practical pathway toward robust steering-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Spectral degeneracies (dubbed nodal points in momentum space) play fundamental roles in understanding exotic properties of light and matter. In lattice systems, unpaired band-structure degeneracies are subject to well-established no-go (doubling) theorems that universally apply to both closed Hermitian systems and open non-Hermitian systems. However, the non-Abelian braid topology of non-Hermitian multi-band systems provides a loophole to these constraints. Here we successfully leverage this loophole in a non-Hermitian three-band system, implementing an unpaired third-order exceptional point (EP3), which manifests as a non-Abelian monopole. We explicitly demonstrate the intricate braiding topology and non-Abelian, path-dependent, fusion rules underlying the unpaired EP3. The experiment uses a new design of single-photon interferometry, enabling eigenstate and spectral resolutions for multi-band systems with widely tunable parameters. Thus, the union of state-of-the-art experiments, fundamental theory, and everyday concepts such as braids pave the way toward the highly exotic non-Abelian topology unique to non-Hermitian settings.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Pichler, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moiré materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>We analyze the Namioka-Phelps minimal and maximal tensor products of compact convex sets arising as state spaces of C$^*$-algebras, and, relatedly, study entanglement in (infinite dimensional) C$^*$-algebras. The minimal Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the state spaces of two C$^*$-algebras is shown to correspond to the set of separable (= un-entangled) states on the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. We show that these maximal and minimal tensor product of the state spaces agree precisely when one of the two C$^*$-algebras is commutative. This confirms an old conjecture by Barker in the case where the compact convex sets are state spaces of C$^*$-algebras. The Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the trace simplexes of two C$^*$-algebras is shown always to be the trace simplex of the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. This can be used, for example, to show that the trace simplex of (any) tensor product of C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex if and only if the trace simplex of each of the C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex or trivial (and not all trivial).</p>

            <p>We construct an effective field theory (EFT) that captures the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) at late times in generic quantum many-body systems with conservation laws. The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.</p>

            <h2>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni A. Ummarino, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$ nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</p>

            <p>Mobile spin qubit architectures promise flexible connectivity for efficient quantum error correction and relaxed device layout constraints, but their viability rests on preserving spin coherence during transport. While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\,\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\,\mu\text{s}$. For the same setup, we demonstrate that dressed-state shuttling provides robust protection against low-frequency noise with a decay time $T_R^{\text{sh}} = 21\,\mu\text{s}$, without the overhead of pulsed control and allowing protection during one-way spin transport. By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo José Ribeiro</p>
            <p>Optimizing carbon credit portfolios is a critical challenge for climate mitigation, particularly in high-biodiversity biomes such as the Brazilian Cerrado. This study explores the practical application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) combined with Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) to address a multi-objective territorial planning problem. We model an 88-variable portfolio optimization involving carbon sequestration, biodiversity connectivity, and social impact metrics, executed on intermediate-scale IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_torino and ibm_fez). The results of seven independent hardware runs demonstrate that the QAOA+ZNE workflow consistently outperforms a classical greedy baseline. The quantum method achieves a mean portfolio score of 58.47 +/- 6.98, corresponding to a 31.6% improvement over the classical heuristic (44.42), with high statistical significance (p = 0.0009) and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 2.01), where ZNE yields extrapolated expectation values of the portfolio objective rather than a discrete portfolio solution without noise. A validation run conducted after a 13-day interval confirms the temporal stability of the methodology against hardware calibration drifts. These findings establish empirical quantum utility in an environmental science context, showing that current NISQ-era devices, when coupled with rigorous error mitigation, can identify complex territorial synergies that myopic classical approaches overlook. The proposed workflow provides a scalable methodological template for high-precision environmental conservation policies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koichi Nakagawa</p>
            <p>We propose a unified structural framework for information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes. The central idea is to interpret non-Markovianity as an embedding phenomenon in which observable degrees of freedom exchange information with hidden auxiliary sectors. Our approach is based on two standard formalisms in nonequilibrium physics: (i) the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator master equations, and (ii) the correspondence principle of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics (NETFD), which provides a doubling construction equivalent to an embedding of density-operator dynamics into a vector evolution in an enlarged space. We define a general information-backflow functional N_I associated with an information quantity I(t) and derive sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow (N_I = 0) in terms of divisibility properties of the instantaneous TCL generator. We further introduce a decomposition of backflow into classical and intrinsic thermo-field entanglement contributions, leading to a classification of transient overshoot and revival phenomena in a model-independent manner. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are discussed as analytically tractable examples, recovering Mittag-Leffler fractional relaxation as a universal envelope. We also provide a constructive TC-to-TCL algorithm for extracting effective rates and producing phase diagrams of backflow.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Estimation of Delay Tail Probabilities in Scheduling and Load Balancing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Srikant</p>
            <p>Estimating delay tail probabilities in scheduling and load balancing systems is a critical but computationally prohibitive task due to the rarity of violation events. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers a generic quadratic reduction in sample complexity 1/sqrt(p) vs 1/p, but applying it to steady-state queueing networks in challenging: classical simulations involve unbounded state spaces and random regeneration cycles, whereas quantum circuits have fixed depth and finite registers. In this paper, we develop a framework for quantum simulation of delay tail probabilities based on truncated regenerative simulation. We show that regenerative rare-event estimators can be reformulated as deterministic, reversible functions of finite random seeds by truncating regeneration cycles. To control the resulting bias, we use Lyapunov drift and concentration arguments to derive exponential tail bounds on regeneration times. This allows the truncation horizon--and hence the quantum circuit depth--to be chosen such that the bias is provably negligible compared to the statistical error. The proposed framework enables quantum estimation in models with countably infinite state spaces, avoiding the challenge of determining the sufficient mixing time required for direct finite-horizon simulation. We provide bounds on qubit and circuit complexity for a GI-GI-1 queue, a wireless network under MaxWeight scheduling, and a multi-server system with Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) routing.</p>

            <p>Understanding thermodynamics far from equilibrium at the quantum scale remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in the presence of quantum coherence. Here we develop a first-principles framework for nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics by integrating quantum resource theory of coherence with thermodynamic laws. We derive a previously unexplored entropy balance relation that explicitly separates entropy flux due to heat exchange from entropy production arising from the loss of quantum coherence. This formulation identifies the appropriate thermodynamic entropy in nonequilibrium quantum processes as the energy entropy associated with energy measurements, demonstrating that the von Neumann entropy does not, in general, represent thermodynamic entropy away from equilibrium. Within this framework, dynamical temperature, free energy, work, and heat are consistently defined, and both the first and second laws are shown to hold far from equilibrium. Applying the theory to an exactly solvable open quantum system, we reveal how equilibrium thermodynamics emerges dynamically in the weak-coupling limit. Our results establish a unified and operational foundation for nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and clarify the fundamental thermodynamic role of quantum coherence.</p>

            <p>Although entanglement can boost metrological precision beyond the standard quantum limit, the advantage often disappears with particle loss. We demonstrate that scrambling safeguards precision by dispersing information about the encoded parameter into many-body correlations. For Haar-random scrambling unitaries, we derive exact formulas for the average quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state after tracing out lost particles. The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank. We outline two realizations -- a brickwork circuit and chaotic XX-chain evolution -- and demonstrate the protection of one-axis-twisted probes against the loss of up to half of the particles.</p>

            <p>Although gravitational waves are now routinely observed, the detection of individual gravitons has long been regarded as impossible. Recent work, however, has demonstrated that single-graviton detection can be achieved and may be feasible in the near future. Here we show that beyond mere particle detection, these detectors provide access to the quantum state and particle statistics of gravitational waves. We show that graviton detection probabilities enable the discrimination between squeezed, coherent, and thermal radiation. We further demonstrate that the full quantum statistics contained in the second-order correlation function of the passing wave can be directly measured at the detector, independent of the weak gravitational interaction strength. Building on recent quantum-optical techniques, this capability opens the way to full quantum state tomography of Gaussian states. Our results demonstrate that single-graviton detection is not only of foundational significance but also of practical value, allowing for the characterization of quantum statistics and the states of the gravitational radiation field, which remain currently unknown.</p>

            <p>The spin-dynamics of two alkali atoms in an optical tweezer is driven by spin-changing collisions that couple the spin-state of the atoms to their relative motion. This paper experimentally studies the resulting spin-states when the relative motion is in a thermal state with k B T much larger than the energies of the spin-states that take part in the dynamics. We find that an initially unentangled spin-state can evolve into an entangled state. This is contrary to the common case when coupling a quantum system to hot degrees of freedom leads to loss of entanglement and not its generation. Moreover, we show that the generated entanglement is technologically useful as it, in principle, can enhance the sensitivity of measurements beyond the standard quantum limit. This may provide a promising avenue for robust entanglement generation for future technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Jafari, Ali Asadian, Mehdi Biderang, Alireza Akbari</p>
            <p>We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.</p>

            <h2>Resources of the advantage in quantum Illumination: Discord and entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mojtaba Asadollahi, Mohammad Hossein Zarei</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum advantage in quantum illumination using two-qubit mixed states as the initial resource. We show that in quantum illumination, the achievable advantage is determined by an interplay between initial entanglement and discord. First, we rigorously show that the quantum advantage for a given state equals the amount of discord consumed for illumination. Subsequently, we find that states with identical initial discord can lead to varying advantages, indicating that the usable portion of discord for illumination depends on additional structural features of the state. Then, we consider the relation between the advantage and both entanglement and discord by performing a conditional extremal analysis. To this end, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial discord, we compute the maximum and minimum initial entanglement within each cluster. We demonstrate that, for states with fixed initial discord, the maximum (and not minimum) entanglement increases by increment of the advantage. We conclude that for any given initial discord, higher entanglement is a sufficient (but not necessary) resource for higher advantage. On the other hand, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial entanglement, we compute the maximum and minimum initial discord in each group. Here, the minimum (and not always maximum) discord scales monotonically with advantage. It shows that, for fixed initial entanglement, higher discord is a necessary (but not always sufficient) resource for higher advantage. This result provides a refined, operational perspective on how different forms of quantum correlations govern the performance of the illumination protocol. We finally find a persistent linear dependence of the advantage on initial discord in the high-noise regime, highlighting discord as the key resource for resilience to noise in the protocol.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative phase transitions of the Dicke-Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-Ling Wang, Jiong Li, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>The dissipative phase transitions in the open transverse and longitudinal Dicke-Ising model (DIM), which incorporates nearest-neighbor Ising-type spin interactions into the Dicke framework, are investigated within a mean-field approach and further validated by detailed stability analysis. While the dissipative phase diagram of the transverse DIM is only slightly shifted upward compared with its ground-state counterpart, dissipation in the longitudinal DIM stabilizes bistable nonequilibrium steady states and induces first-order phase transitions that are absent in the ground-state phase diagram. This bistable phase is characterized by the coexistence of superradiant and antiferromagnetic orders, and it converts a ground-state triple point into a tetracritical point, at which the boundaries of the first- and second-order transitions intersect. Our results reveal that the interplay among spin interactions, light-matter coupling, and dissipation supports a diverse set of nonequilibrium phase transitions and provides broad tunability of the phase diagram. These findings offer a theoretical foundation for exploring nonequilibrium physics in realistic open solid-state quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cambyse Rouzé, Daniel Stilck França, Álvaro M. Alhambra</p>
            <p>It is of great interest to understand the thermalization of open quantum many-body systems, and how quantum computers are able to efficiently simulate that process. A recently introduced disispative evolution, inspired by existing models of open system thermalization, has been shown to be efficiently implementable on a quantum computer. Here, we prove that, at high enough temperatures, this evolution reaches the Gibbs state in time scaling logarithmically with system size. The result holds for Hamiltonians that satisfy the Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice, and includes long-range systems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the rapid mixing property of high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers, which is known to give the fastest possible speed for thermalization in the many-body setting. We then employ our result to the problem of estimating partition functions at high temperature, showing an improved performance over previous classical and quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>The correlations of certain entangled states can be perfectly simulated classically via a local model. Hence such states are termed Bell local, as they cannot lead to Bell inequality violation. Here, we show that Bell nonlocality can nevertheless be activated for certain Bell-local states via a catalytic process. Specifically, we present a protocol where a Bell-local state, combined with a catalyst, is transformed into a Bell-nonlocal state while the catalyst is returned exactly in its initial state. Importantly, this transformation is deterministic and based only on local operations. Moreover, this procedure is possible even when the state of the catalyst is itself Bell local, demonstrating a new form of superactivation of Bell nonlocality, as well as an interesting form of quantum catalysis. On the technical level, our main tool is a formal connection between catalytic activation and many-copy activation.</p>

            <p>Allowing the order of quantum operations to exist in superposition is known to open new routes for thermodynamic tasks. We investigate a quantum heat engine where energy exchanges are driven by generalized measurements, and the sequence of these operations is coherently controlled in a superposition of causal orders. Our analysis explores how initial correlations between the working medium and the controller affect the engine's performance. Considering uncorrelated, classically correlated, and entangled initial states, we show that entanglement enables the superposed causal order to generate coherence in the working medium, thereby enhancing work extraction and efficiency beyond the separable and uncorrelated cases. Finally, we present a proof-of-principle simulation on the IBM Quantum Experience platform, realizing a quantum switch of two measurement channels with tunable strengths and experimentally confirming the predicted efficiency enhancement enabled by correlation-assisted superposed causal order.</p>

            <p>The Euler-Bernoulli beam model has been studied classically and semi-classically. The semi-classical quantization is done in an analogous way to the quantization of the electromagnetic field, and we found an effect that is similar to the Casimir effect, which is the photonic Casimir effect. The Casimir force, by unit area, is proportional to the first mode energy divided by the volume of the beam. For the hinged-hinged boundary condition, degenerate states were found. These degenerate pairs form decoherence-free subspaces for dispersive thermal reservoirs. For other boundary conditions, there are also subspaces with lower decoherence rates, which occur for quasi-degenerate states.</p>

            <h2>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indrajit Sen, Matthew Leifer</p>
            <p>We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</p>

            <p>The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. In this letter, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</p>

            <h2>Alleviating Post-Linearization Challenges for Solving Nonlinear Systems on a Quantum Computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tayyab Ali</p>
            <p>The linearity inherent in quantum mechanics limits current quantum hardware from directly solving nonlinear systems governed by nonlinear differential equations. One can opt for linearization frameworks such as Carleman linearization, which provides a high dimensional infinite linear system corresponding to a finite nonlinear system, as an indirect way of solving nonlinear systems using current quantum computers. We provide an efficient data access model to load this infinite linear representation of the nonlinear system, upto truncation order $N$, on a quantum computer by decomposing the Hamiltonian into the weighted sum of non-unitary operators, namely the Sigma basis. We have shown that the Sigma basis provides an exponential reduction in the number of decomposition terms compared to the traditional decomposition, which is usually done in a linear combination of Pauli operators. Once the Hamiltonian is decomposed, we then use the concept of unitary completion to construct the circuit for the implementation of each weighted tensor product component $\mathcal{H}_{j}$ of the decomposition.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors are an ideal candidate for detecting weak electromagnetic signals because of their exceptional sensitivity and compact form factor. In this work, we analyze the performance of a quantum-sensor-based receive chain for demodulating information encoded in phase-modulated electromagnetic waves. We introduce a generalized cumulant expansion to model a noisy quantum receiver and use it to compare the performance of various quantum demodulation protocols. Employing bit error probability (BEP) and channel capacity as quantitative performance metrics, we compare the capabilities of ensembles of quantum sensors - both unentangled and entangled - using Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) as a representative example of phase modulation. We identify conditions when the channel capacity of an ensemble of quantum sensors may surpass the limits of a classical electrically small antenna. Additionally, we discuss modifications to the quantum protocol that enables high-fidelity data recovery even in the presence of sensor noise and channel distortions. Finally, we explore practical performance limits of such a quantum receive chain, with a focus on NV-diamond as the quantum sensor platform.</p>

Consequently, a number of quantum algorithms for studying the physical properties of such systems have been developed. While qubit-based quantum computers are naturally suited to the study of spin-1/2 systems, systems containing other degrees of freedom must first be encoded into qubits. Transformations to and from fermionic degrees of freedom have long been an important tool in physics and, now the simulation of fermionic systems on quantum computers based on qubits provides yet another application. In this perspective, we review methods for encoding fermionic degrees of freedom into qubits and attempt to dispel the persistent notion that fermionic systems beyond one dimension are fundamentally more difficult to deal with.</p>

            <p>We investigate a constant-time, fusion measurement-based scheme to create AKLT states beyond one dimension. We show that it is possible to prepare such states on a given graph up to random spin-1 `decorations', each corresponding to a probabilistic insertion of a vertex along an edge. In investigating their utility in measurement-based quantum computation, we demonstrate that any such randomly decorated AKLT state possesses at least the same computational power as non-random ones, such as those on trivalent planar lattices. For AKLT states on Bethe lattices and their decorated versions we show that there exists a deterministic, constant-time scheme for their preparation. In addition to randomly decorated AKLT states, we also consider random-bond AKLT states, whose construction involves any of the canonical Bell states in the bond degrees of freedom instead of just the singlet in the original construction. Such states naturally emerge upon measuring all the decorative spin-1 sites in the randomly decorated AKLT states. We show that those random-bond AKLT states on trivalent lattices can be converted to encoded random graph states after acting with the same POVM on all sites. We also argue that these random-bond AKLT states possess similar quantum computational power as the original singlet-bond AKLT states via the percolation perspective.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of a dressed qubit implemented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites with each site strongly coupled to a bath of phonons. We employ Lang-Firsov transformation to make the problem tractable perturbatively. Applying time-convolutionless master equation within the polaron frame, we investigate decoherence dynamics of the dressed qubit within the singlet-triplet basis of the system for a wide range of bath spectral densities. It is shown that the coherence persists for longer time scales for large coupling values and shows non-monotonic behaviour reflecting the presence of non-Markovianity in the dynamics. Non-Markovianity, characterized by coherence revivals and non-monotonic decay patterns, emerges distinctly depending on the bath spectrum and coupling strengths. Systems coupled to sub-Ohmic baths, whether both or in combination with another type, display pronounced memory effects at relatively small values of couplings. In contrast, combinations involving Ohmic and super-Ohmic baths exhibit noticeable non-Markovianity only at higher couplings.</p>

This essential characteristic is utilized for detecting weak nonlinearities in both the cavity and magnonic modes, with both demonstrating similar high levels of sensitivity. Moreover, the sensitivity can be greatly improved with a detuned laser drive. Based on the integrated passive-active three-mode anti-PT symmetric system, the sensing scheme can be generalized to various physical systems with anharmonicities.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entangled states of continuous variables are fundamental resources for scalable quantum information processing. We study the correlation hierarchy in a tripartite state engineered by mixing a two-mode squeezed vacuum with a coherent state on a tritter, a key linear optical element for multimode state generation. Using the covariance matrix formalism, we comprehensively analyze the entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering among the output modes. The strength of both correlations is governed solely by the squeezing parameter and is independent of the coherent amplitude. We further examine the impact of inevitable optical losses in various channel configurations. The results show that while losses degrade correlations, EPR steering remains monogamous and exhibits stricter resilience thresholds than entanglement. Our analysis, supported by parameter extension techniques, confirms that the steering condition is more stringent than the inseparability criterion, clearly demonstrating that steering forms a strict subset of entanglement. These results elucidate the correlation structure in a readily generated multimode state and offer practical insights for developing asymmetric quantum protocols, such as one-sided device-independent tasks, where EPR steering serves as a critical resource.</p>

We here study the geometric criticality associated with these eigenstates. The amplitude and phase of the drive serve as the control parameter of the governing Hamiltonian. We find the quantum metric and Berry curvature tensors for each eigenstate display divergent behaviors in the critical region. More importantly, the divergence associated with bright eigenstates is much more pronounced than that for the unique dark state. Our theoretical results can be experimentally confirmed in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems, where the driven Jaynes-Cummings model has been realized.</p>

            <p>Certifying high-dimensional quantum channels is essential for ensuring the reliability of quantum communication protocols. Existing certification schemes often rely on fully trusted internal devices, which is difficult to achieve in realistic scenarios. Here, we propose a semi-device-independent framework for certifying channel properties directly from observed statistics, assuming only that the system dimension is known. By explicitly incorporating the full set of structural constraints inherent to Choi states, our approach exploits the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism for rigorous certification of quantum channels. The entanglement dimensionality of quantum channels is first certified by introducing a witness and numerically determining its Schmidt-number-dependent bounds. This certification method reproduces known analytical benchmarks and is applied to dephasing and depolarizing noise channels, thereby confirming its validity. To provide a more complete assessment of channel performance, the entanglement fidelity of quantum channels is also certified using a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations based on localizing matrices. Lower bounds on the entanglement fidelity are obtained that are compatible with either the full set of observed statistics or a single witness value.</p>

            <p>Bosonic modes constitute a central resource in a wide range of quantum technologies, providing long-lived degrees of freedom for the storage, processing, and transduction of quantum information. Such modes naturally arise in platforms including circuit quantum electrodynamics, quantum acoustodynamics, and trapped-ion systems. In these architectures, coherent control and high-fidelity readout of the bosonic degrees of freedom are achieved via coupling to an auxiliary qubit. When operated in the strong dispersive regime, this interaction enables parity measurements of the mode which, in combination with phase-space displacements, constitute a standard experimental tool for full Wigner-function tomography. Here, we propose a protocol based on displaced parity measurements that allows for the preparation of a variety of bosonic quantum states. As a first example, we demonstrate the generation of squeezed states, achieving up to ~9 dB of squeezing after only three parity measurements, and show that the protocol is robust against experimental imperfections. Finally, we generalize our approach to the preparation of other paradigmatic bosonic states, including cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states.</p>

            <p>We propose a heralded high-probability scheme to generate remote entanglement between moderate-cooperativity spin-cavity registers with high fidelity. In conventional single-shot interfaces, limited cooperativity restricts the spin-conditional optical response and thus strongly suppresses the success probability. Our proposal instead recycles a single incident photon for repeated interactions with the spin-cavity register, such that a small spin-conditional phase shift acquired on each round trip accumulates coherently to enable remote entanglement. Moreover, the repeated scheme enables higher spin-photon encoding efficiency by using a spectral-width-scaling photon pulse with a shorter duration. We show that, for realistic imperfections and losses, this repeated phase-encoding approach produces high-fidelity entangled states with an appreciable success probability even at cooperativity $C\sim1$. Our protocol is particularly well suited to weakly coupled, cavity-based solid-state spin platforms and provides a route toward hybrid, photon-loss-tolerant distributed quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>High-brightness fiber-based Sagnac source of entangled photon pairs for multiplexed quantum networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tess Troisi, Yoann Pelet, Romain Dalidet, Gregory Sauder, Olivier Alibart, Sébastien Tanzilli, Anthony Martin</p>
            <p>A fully fibered source of entangled photon pairs based on a nonlinear Sagnac interferometer is reported. Operating at telecom wavelengths, the source relies exclusively on standard fiber-optic components and periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguides, resulting in a compact, robust, and field-deployable architecture. The generation stage supports both polarization and energy-time entanglement without modification, enabling versatile operation depending on the targeted application. Broadband spontaneous parametric down-conversion allows dense wavelength-division multiplexing over the telecom C and L bands. High normalized brightness (10.3 kpairs/s/nm/mW$^2$) is achieved on a standard 100 GHz ITU channel pair, together with high entanglement quality. Polarization and energy-time encodings are characterized through state tomography and two-photon interference measurements, yielding fidelities, purities, and visibilities exceeding 96 % over multiple wavelength channels. The stability and reproducibility of the source are further evaluated through long-duration operation in a network environment. These results demonstrate that the proposed Sagnac source constitutes a practical and scalable building block for future plug-and-play quantum communication and quantum networking platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to exchange a secret key between two parties. Despite its promising features, QKD also faces several practical challenges such as transmission loss, noise in quantum channels and finite key size effects. Addressing these issues is crucial for the large-scale deployment of QKD in fiber and satellite networks. In this paper, we present a 1550 nm QKD system realizing the efficient-BB84 protocol and based on the iPOGNAC scheme. The system achieved repetition rates up to 1.5~GHz and showed an intrinsic QBER of $\sim 0.4\%$. The system was first tested on a laboratory fiber link and then on an intermodal link in the field, consisting of both deployed fiber and a 620 m free-space channel. The experiment was performed in daylight conditions, exploiting the Qubit4Sync synchronization protocol. With this trial, we achieved a new benchmark for free-space BB84 QKD systems by generating a sustained secret key rate (SKR) above 1~Mb/s for 1 hour. Finally, exploiting a recently discovered finite-size bound, we achieved a secure key rate of about 10 Mb/s at low losses (5 dB), and around 6.5~kb/s in the high-loss (38.5 dB), low block length ($N=10^4$) regime. The latter results demonstrate the system's suitability for highly lossy and time-constrained scenarios such as QKD from low Earth orbit satellites.</p>

            <p>Using polarization entangled photon pairs, we demonstrate a robust scheme for quantum illumination and ranging in a lossy environment. Entangled photon pairs are generated in a Sagnac interferometer configuration, yielding high-visibility two-photon polarization entanglement with a measured CHSH parameter of $S =2.802\pm0.002$. One of the photons from the entangled pair is retained as idler and the other one is directed into either of the two paths, namely reference and probe, of which probe is sent toward a distant object through a lossy free-space channel, and the reflected photons are collected after round-trip free-space propagation over distances approaching $1$ km. Remarkably, strong correlations are observed with CHSH values $S >2.6$ even when only a few tens of probe photons are returned, confirming the robustness of polarization entanglement under long-distance free-space propagation. This work reports the robustness of encoding photons in different basis before it is sent towards the object and recovery of polarization entanglement even after a kilometer-scale scattering from the objects, establishing a practical foundation for scalable quantum-assisted object detection and ranging.</p>

            <p>Quantum chemistry and materials science are among the most promising areas for demonstrating algorithmic quantum advantage and quantum utility due to their inherent quantum mechanical nature. Still, large-scale simulations of quantum circuits are essential for determining the problem size at which quantum solutions outperform classical methods. In this work, we present a novel hybrid simulation approach, forming a hybrid of a fullstate and a Clifford simulator, specifically designed to address the computational challenges associated with the time evolution of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our method focuses on the efficient emulation of multi-qubit rotations, a critical component of Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution. By optimizing the representation and execution of multi-qubit operations leveraging the Pauli frame, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of simulating quantum circuits, enabling more efficient simulations. Beyond its impact on chemistry applications, our emulation strategy has broad implications for any computational workload that relies heavily on multi-qubit rotations. By increasing the efficiency of quantum simulations, our method facilitates more accurate and cost-effective studies of complex quantum systems. We quantify the performance improvements and computational savings for this emulation strategy, and we obtain a speedup of a factor $\approx 18$ ($\approx 22$ with MPI) for our evaluated chemistry Hamiltonians with 24 qubits. Thus, we evaluate our integration of this emulation strategy into the Intel Quantum SDK, further bridging the gap between theoretical algorithm development and practical quantum software implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Udaykumar Gajera, Mohsen Sotoudeh, Kanchan Sarkar, Axel Groß</p>
            <p>Symbolic Regression (SR) enables the discovery of interpretable mathematical relationships from experimental and simulation data. These relationships are often coined descriptors which are defined as a fundamental materials property that is directly correlated to a desired or undesired functional property of the material. Although established approaches such as Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) have successfully identified low-dimensional descriptors within large feature spaces many existing SR tools integrate poorly with modern Python workflows, offer limited control over the symbolic search space, or struggle with the computational demands of large-scale studies. This paper introduces DISCOVER (Data-Informed Symbolic Combination of Operators for Variable Equation Regression), an open-source symbolic regression package developed to address these challenges through a modular, physics-motivated design. DISCOVER allows users to guide the symbolic search using domain knowledge, constrain the feature space explicitly, and take advantage of optional GPU acceleration to improve computational efficiency in data-intensive workflows, enabling reproducible and scalable SR workflows. The software is intended for applications in computational physics, computational chemistry, and materials science, where interpretability, physical consistency, and execution time are especially important, and it complements general-purpose SR frameworks by emphasizing the discovery of physically meaningful models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhilong Liu, Wentao Liu, Zehua Tian, Jieci Wang</p>
            <p>The complete evaporation of black holes, as a natural endpoint of Hawking radiation, gives rise to the black hole information paradox, which fundamentally challenges the principles of unitarity and information conservation in quantum mechanics. Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox.</p>

What if we told you that in the real world, something even crazier might be happening all the time, right under our noses? Imagine shrinking down to the size of an atom. What you'd see wouldn't be like our everyday world at all! This is the realm of quantum physics, where the rules we know do not apply, where things exist everywhere and nowhere at once. The moment you observe something, it starts behaving differently. In this article, we will explore two of the many possible explanations for such phenomena, namely the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics. We will also try to answer the question of whether there are many copies of you roaming around in different universes, and why you haven't met one.</p>

            <h2>Zero-point energy of solids from vacuum fluctuation and quantum geometric force</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yugo Onishi, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We show that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields induce an additional zero-point energy in solids, which scales with the volume. For insulators, the zero-point energy density is proportional to quantum fluctuation of electric polarization in the many-body ground state, a fundamental quantum geometric property of solids known as the quantum weight. Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force. The proposed effects provide direct experimental access to the many-body quantum geometry and reveal a new macroscopic quantum effect in solids induced by vacuum fluctuation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Zhuoyang Ye, Jiyuan Wang, Yifan Qiao, Jens Palsberg</p>
            <p>As quantum computing enters the cloud era, thousands of users must share access to a small number of quantum processors. Users need to wait minutes to days to start their jobs, which only takes a few seconds for execution. Current quantum cloud platforms employ a fair-share scheduler, as there is no way to multiplex a quantum computer among multiple programs at the same time, leaving many qubits idle and significantly under-utilizing the hardware. This imbalance between high user demand and scarce quantum resources has become a key barrier to scalable and cost-effective quantum computing. We present HALO, the first quantum operating system design that supports fine-grained resource-sharing. HALO introduces two complementary mechanisms. First, a hardware-aware qubit-sharing algorithm that places shared helper qubits on regions of the quantum computer that minimize routing overhead and avoid cross-talk noise between different users' processes. Second, a shot-adaptive scheduler that allocates execution windows according to each job's sampling requirements, improving throughput and reducing latency. Together, these mechanisms transform the way quantum hardware is scheduled and achieve more fine-grained parallelism. We evaluate HALO on the IBM Torino quantum computer on helper qubit intense benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art systems such as HyperQ, HALO improves overall hardware utilization by up to 2.44x, increasing throughput by 4.44x, and maintains fidelity loss within 33%, demonstrating the practicality of resource-sharing in quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Unė G. Būtaitė, Martynas Beresna, David B. Phillips</p>
            <p>Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) are an emerging 3D beam shaping technology capable of deterministically mapping a basis of input spatial light modes to a new basis of output modes. The ability to perform such spatial reformatting operations has many future applications in both classical and quantum photonics, spanning from optical communications to photonic computing and imaging. MPLCs are intricate optical systems consisting of a cascade of inverse-designed diffractive optical elements, typically separated by free-space. In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them. We experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept glass-embedded 700x700x2000 micrometer cubed MPLCs: a 3-mode and a 10-mode Hermite-Gaussian mode sorter. We discuss the fabrication challenges and future improvements of these devices. Our work plots a path towards the rapid prototyping of robust monolithic MPLC technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sonali Parashar, Jeremy F. Bourhill, Maxim Goryachev, Michael E. Tobar</p>
            <p>We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huimin You, Jinghu Liu, Yunbo Zhang, Zhihao Xu</p>
            <p>Singular value decomposition (SVD) has been used to construct Hermitian-like diagnostics for non-Hermitian many-body systems, but its reliability for identifying many-body localization (MBL) transitions -- particularly in time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) preserving settings -- remains unclear. Here we benchmark SVD-based diagnostics against exact diagonalization (ED) in TRS-preserving non-Hermitian hard-core-boson chains with nonreciprocal hopping, considering three representative potentials: a quasiperiodic potential, random disorder, and a Stark potential. We compare spectral statistics, half-chain entanglement entropy, inverse participation ratio, and spectral form factors. For the quasiperiodic and random-disorder models, ED yields mutually consistent transition estimates, whereas SVD systematically shifts the inferred critical disorder strength to larger values and can lead to different phase assignments. In contrast, for the clean Stark model ED and SVD locate a consistent critical tilt. Our results show that while SVD-based diagnostics capture qualitative trends, they are not generically reliable for quantitatively locating the MBL transition in TRS-preserving non-Hermitian many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian physics exhibits unique physical properties beyond those of traditional Hermitian systems, such as symmetry breaking, the emergence of exceptional points, topological phase transitions, and more. These phenomena have been extensively studied across various platforms, including quantum optics, cold atom systems, superconducting circuits, and condensed matter physics. Rydberg atoms, with their long-range interactions and flexible controllability, provide a promising platform for the experimental realization of non-Hermitian physics. This review primarily summarizes the key experimental and theoretical achievements in the field of non-Hermitian physics within Rydberg atomic systems in recent years. It outlines the fundamental construction of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals the effective dissipation mechanisms induced by Rydberg atomic interactions, and discusses their impact on spectral properties and symmetry breaking. These studies not only deepen the understanding of quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian many-body systems but also highlight the unique value of Rydberg atomic platforms in realizing and controlling topological states.</p>

            <h2>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni A. Ummarino, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is increasingly practiced through programming, yet most educational offerings emphasize algorithmic or framework-level use rather than software engineering concerns such as testing, abstraction, tooling, and lifecycle management. This paper reports on the design and first offering of a cross-listed undergraduate--graduate course that frames quantum computing through a software engineering lens, focusing on early-stage competence relevant to software engineering practice. The course integrates foundational quantum concepts with software engineering perspectives, emphasizing executable artifacts, empirical reasoning, and trade-offs arising from probabilistic behaviour, noise, and evolving toolchains. Evidence is drawn from instructor observations, student feedback, surveys, and analysis of student work. Despite minimal prior exposure to quantum computing, students were able to engage productively with quantum software engineering topics once a foundational understanding of quantum information and quantum algorithms, expressed through executable artifacts, was established. This experience report contributes a modular course design, a scalable assessment model for mixed academic levels, and transferable lessons for software engineering educators developing quantum computing curricula.</p>

            <h2>A gravitationally induced decoherence model for photons in the context of the relational formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Joseph Fahn, Kristina Giesel, Roman Kemper</p>
            <p>We formulate a model of gravitationally induced decoherence for photons starting from Maxwell theory coupled to linearised gravity, expressed in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero variables and treated as an open quantum field theoretic system. In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing.</p>

As a concrete resource-theoretic application, we implement magic resource (mana) harvesting with a qutrit probe. For a CFT dual to global AdS, we show that the harvested mana sharply distinguishes the two admissible scalar quantizations in the Breitenlohner--Freedman window, with the standard quantization yielding systematically larger mana than the alternate one. Our results provide a viable way of testing holography principle through quantum information resource.</p>

            <p>Multi-Agent Route Planning considers selecting vehicles, each associated with a single predefined route, such that the spatial coverage of a road network is increased while redundant overlaps are limited. This paper gives a formal problem definition, proves NP-hardness by reduction from the Weighted Set Packing problem, and derives a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation whose coefficients directly encode unique coverage rewards and pairwise overlap penalties. A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows.</p>

            <p>We propose a multilevel tensor-train (TT) framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a global space-time formulation. While space-time TT solvers have demonstrated significant potential for compressed high-dimensional simulations, the literature contains few systematic comparisons with classical time-stepping methods, limited error convergence analyses, and little quantitative assessment of the impact of TT rounding on numerical accuracy. Likewise, existing studies fail to demonstrate performance across a diverse set of PDEs and parameter ranges. In practice, monolithic Newton iterations may stagnate or fail to converge in strongly nonlinear, stiff, or advection-dominated regimes, where poor initial guesses and severely ill-conditioned space-time Jacobians hinder robust convergence. We overcome this limitation by introducing a coarse-to-fine multilevel strategy fully embedded within the TT format. Each level refines both spatial and temporal resolutions while transferring the TT solution through low-rank prolongation operators, providing robust initializations for successive Newton solves. Residuals, Jacobians, and transfer operators are represented directly in TT and solved with the adaptive-rank DMRG algorithm. Numerical experiments for a selection of nonlinear PDEs including Fisher-KPP, viscous Burgers, sine-Gordon, and KdV cover diffusive, convective, and dispersive dynamics, demonstrating that the multilevel TT approach consistently converges where single-level space-time Newton iterations fail. In dynamic, advection-dominated (nonlinear) scenarios, multilevel TT surpasses single-level TT, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, specifically when high-fidelity numerical simulation is required.</p>

            <h2>Information-Theoretic Gaps in Solar and Reactor Neutrino Oscillation Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neetu Raj Singh Chundawat, Yu-Feng Li</p>
            <p>Quantum estimation theory provides a fundamental framework for analyzing how precisely physical parameters can be estimated from measurements. Neutrino oscillations are characterized by a set of parameters inferred from experiments conducted in different production and detection environments. The two solar oscillation parameters, $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$, can be estimated using both solar neutrino experiments and reactor neutrino experiments. In reactor experiments, neutrinos are detected after coherent vacuum evolution, while solar neutrinos arrive at the detector as incoherent mixtures. In this work, we use Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) to quantify and compare the information content accessible in these two experimental setups. We find that for reactor neutrinos, flavor measurements saturate the QFI bound for both parameters over specific energy ranges, demonstrating their optimality and explaining the high precision achieved by these experiments. In contrast, for solar neutrinos the phase-based contribution to the QFI, originating from the quantum coherence, is absent, rendering the estimation of $\Delta m_{21}^2$ purely population-based and effectively classical, while the QFI for $\theta_{12}$ is dominated by basis rotation at high energies and is nearly saturated by flavor measurements. Consequently, solar neutrino experiments are intrinsically more sensitive to $\theta_{12}$ than to $\Delta m_{21}^2$. This analysis highlights a fundamental distinction between the two estimation problems and accounts for their differing achievable precisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Mei Li, Jianbo Lu, Shu-Min Wu</p>
            <p>It has traditionally been believed that fermionic entanglement generally outperforms bosonic entanglement in relativistic frameworks, and that bosonic entanglement experiences sudden death in extreme gravitational environments. In this study, we analyze the genuine N-partite entanglement, measured by negativity, of bosonic and fermionic GHZ states, focusing on scenarios where a subset of $m$ ($m<N$) constituents interacts with Hawking radiation generated by a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan C. H. Liu, Hsiao-Yuan Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanics occupies a central position in contemporary science while remaining largely inaccessible to direct sensory experience. This paper proposes a roadmap to quantum aesthetics that examines how quantum concepts become aesthetic phenomena through artistic mediation rather than direct representation. Two complementary and orthogonal approaches are articulated. The first, a pioneering top-down approach, employs text-prompt-based generative AI to probe quantum aesthetics as a collective cultural construct embedded in large-scale training data. By systematically modulating the linguistic weight of the term "quantum," generative models are used as experimental environments to reveal how quantum imaginaries circulate within contemporary visual culture. The second, a bottom-up approach, derives aesthetic form directly from quantum-mechanical structures through the visualization of quantum-generated data, exemplified here by hydrogen atomic orbitals calculated from the Schrödinger equation. These approaches are framed not as competing methods but as intersecting paths within a navigable field of artistic research. They position quantum aesthetics as an emergent field of artistic research shaped by cultural imagination, computational mediation, and physical law, opening new directions for artistic practice and pedagogy at the intersection of art, data, artificial intelligence and quantum science.</p>

            <p>We investigate the lattice dynamics of CaWO$_4$, a promising host crystal for erbium-based quantum memories, using inelastic neutron scattering together with density-functional perturbation theory. The measured phonon dispersion along the (100), (001), and (101) reciprocal space direction reveals phonon bands extending up to 130 meV, with a gap between 60 and 80 meV, in good agreement with our calculations. From a symmetry analysis of the phonon eigenmodes, we identify eight Raman-active modes that can couple directly to the Er$^{3+}$ crystal-field operators, including a low-energy $B_g$ mode at 9.1 meV that is expected to play a dominant role in phonon-assisted spin-lattice relaxation. These results provide a microscopic description of the phonon bath in CaWO$_4$ and establish a basis for engineering phononic environments to mitigate the loss of stored quantum states and optimize Er-doped CaWO$_4$ for quantum-memory applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Colombo</p>
            <p>We propose a geometric model predictive control framework for quantum systems subject to smoothness and state constraints. By formulating quantum state evolution intrinsically on the projective Hilbert space, we penalize covariant accelerations to generate smooth trajectories in the form of Riemannian cubics, while incorporating state-dependent constraints through potential functions. A structure-preserving variational discretization enables receding-horizon implementation, and a Lyapunov-type stability result is established for the closed-loop system. The approach is illustrated on the Bloch sphere for a two-level quantum system, providing a viable pathway toward predictive feedback control of constrained quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has made important headway in helping to improve the treatment of quantum many-body systems. A domain of particular relevance are correlated inhomogeneous systems. What has been missing so far is a general, scalable deep-learning approach that would enable the rapid prediction of spatial densities for strongly correlated systems in arbitrary potentials. In this work, we present a straightforward scheme, where we learn to predict densities using convolutional neural networks trained on random potentials. While we demonstrate this approach in 1D and 2D lattice models using data from numerical techniques like Quantum Monte Carlo, it is directly applicable as well to training data obtained from experimental quantum simulators. We train networks that can predict the densities of multiple observables simultaneously and that can predict for a whole class of many-body lattice models, for arbitrary system sizes. We show that our approach can handle well the interplay of interference and interactions and the behaviour of models with phase transitions in inhomogeneous situations, and we also illustrate the ability to solve inverse problems, finding a potential for a desired density.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Palash Pandya</p>
            <p>The Hilbert-Schmidt distance between two states is proven to be non-contractive under CPTP maps, and therefore is not considered as an entanglement measure. However, that alone does not imply that the minimum Hilbert-Schmidt distance from the set of separable states is not contractive as well. To the contrary, not only do we provide a closed-form expression, we also provide analytical and numerical proof that minimum Hilbert-Schmidt distance for a given bipartite quantum state of Schmidt rank 2 is non-increasing under LOCC. The minimisation is taken to be over the set of separable states. We apply the algorithm by Verstraete et al [Journal of Modern Optics, 49(8), 2002] for the derivation of the analytical expression and Nielsen's theorem for the proof of monotonicity of the distance under LOCC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keshav Das Agarwal, Debkanta Ghosh, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>A spin-$s$ variable-range interacting Ising model may display qualitatively different behaviors depending on the fall-off rate of the interactions, as already seen in equilibrium studies of spin-1/2 systems. We propose a dynamical method using weighted graph states, generated through time evolution that confirms the existence of the transition point in the fall-off rate for the spin-$s$ Ising model. Moreover, the dependence of local dimension on information spreading and multipartite entanglement profile in this model remains unclear, which we establish here. In particular, our analysis shows that the maximum of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) with the fall-off rate serves as a clear indicator of the information spreading, which aligns with changes in the profile of the Lieb-Robinson bound. Further, in the case of an open chain, the spread of information is related to the divergence in the first derivative of GME. Additionally, we validate this signature by performing a scaling analysis of the time-averaged mutual information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kelvin Onggadinata, Andrew Tanggara, Mile Gu, Dagomir Kaszlikowski</p>
            <p>In stochastic modeling, the excess entropy -- the mutual information shared between a process's past and future -- represents the fundamental lower bound of the memory needed to simulate its dynamics. However, this bound cannot be saturated by either classical machines or their enhanced quantum counterparts. Simulating a process fundamentally requires us to store more information in the present than is shared between the past and the future. Here, we consider a generalization of hidden Markov models beyond classical and quantum models, referred to as n-machines, that allow for negative quasiprobabilities. We show that under the collision entropy measure of information, the minimal memory of such models can equal the excess entropy. Our results suggest that negativity can be a useful resource for achieving nonclassical memory advantage.</p>

            <h2>Direct Estimation of the Density of States for Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew L. Goh, Bálint Koczor</p>
            <p>Simulating time evolution is one of the most natural applications of quantum computers and is thus one of the most promising prospects for achieving practical quantum advantage. Here, we develop quantum algorithms to extract thermodynamic properties by estimating the density of states (DOS), a central object in quantum statistical mechanics. We introduce several innovations that significantly improve the practicality and extend the generality of previous techniques. First, our approach allows one to estimate the DOS only for a specific subspace of the full Hilbert space. This is crucial for fermionic systems, since both canonical and grand canonical ensemble thermal equilibrium properties depend on subspaces of fixed number. Second, in our approach, by time evolving very simple, random initial states, such as randomly chosen computational basis states, we can exactly recover the DOS on average. Third, due to circuit-depth limitations, we only reconstruct the DOS up to a convolution with a Gaussian window - thus all imperfections that shift the energy levels by less than the width of the convolution window will not significantly affect the estimated DOS. For these reasons we find the approach is a promising candidate for early quantum advantage as even short-time, noisy dynamics can yield a semi-quantitative reconstruction of the DOS (convolution with a broad Gaussian window), while early fault tolerant devices will likely enable higher resolution DOS reconstruction through longer time evolutions. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach in representative Fermi-Hubbard and spin models and indeed find that our approach is highly robust against algorithmic errors in the time evolution and against gate noise. We further demonstrate that our approach is compatible with NISQ-friendly variational techniques, introducing and leveraging a new technique for variational time evolution.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</h2>

            <p>Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves substantial speedups over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Rare Events and Griffiths Phases in Topological Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya Sriram, Nicholas O'Dea, Yaodong Li, Tibor Rakovszky, Vedika Khemani</p>
            <p>The performance of quantum error correcting (QEC) codes are often studied under the assumption of spatio-temporally uniform error rates. On the other hand, experimental implementations almost always produce heterogeneous error rates, in either space or time, as a result of effects such as imperfect fabrication and/or cosmic rays. It is therefore important to understand if and how their presence can affect the performance of QEC in qualitative ways. In this work, we study effects of non-uniform error rates in the representative examples of the 1D repetition code and the 2D toric code, focusing on when they have extended spatio-temporal correlations; these may arise, for instance, from rare events (such as cosmic rays) that temporarily elevate error rates over the entire code patch. These effects can be described in the corresponding statistical mechanics models for decoding, where long-range correlations in the error rates lead to extended rare regions of weaker coupling. For the 1D repetition code where the rare regions are linear, we find two distinct decodable phases: a conventional ordered phase in which logical failure rates decay exponentially with the code distance, and a rare-region dominated Griffiths phase in which failure rates are parametrically larger and decay as a stretched exponential. In particular, the latter phase is present when the error rates in the rare regions are above the bulk threshold. For the 2D toric code where the rare regions are planar, we find no decodable Griffiths phase: rare events which boost error rates above the bulk threshold lead to an asymptotic loss of threshold and failure to decode. Unpacking the failure mechanism implies that techniques for suppressing extended sequences of repeated rare events (which, without intervention, will be statistically present with high probability) will be crucial for QEC with the toric code.</p>

            <h2>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Lastres, Frank Pollmann, Sanjay Moudgalya</p>
            <p>An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</p>

            <p>A hallmark of classical ergodicity is the complete loss of memory of the initial conditions due to eventual uniform covering of {\it a priori} available phase space. In quantum counterparts of such systems, however, this classical ergodic ideal is fundamentally limited: Here, we introduce the concept of a \emph{quantum birthmark}, a permanent signature left by the initial state and its early-time evolution in a general quantum system, which gives rise to non-ergodic behavior persisting even in the infinite-time limit. We present a birthmark framework outlining a ubiquitous memory effect for an arbitrary, non-stationary state composed of two factors conspiring together: the universal and the revival-enhancement. The former sets the minimal amplification carried by the time evolution of a quantum state based on global symmetries, whereas the latter incorporates the further enhancement stemming from the early dynamics, particularly prominent in the presence of recurrences that occur before the Heisenberg time. As a concrete example, we identify quantum birthmarks in the venerable stadium billiard, where they can be significantly enhanced by quantum scars. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of quantum birthmarks, including their role as a natural extension of all types of scarring theories to generic non-stationary quantum systems and prospects for experimental observation. Generally, our work opens an unexplored avenue for understanding the elusive quantum nature of ergodicity.</p>

            <p>Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</p>

            <p>Expectation Value Samplers (EVSs) are quantum generative models that can learn high-dimensional continuous distributions by measuring the expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits. However, these models can demand impractical quantum resources for good performance. We investigate how observable choices affect EVS performance and propose an Observable-Tunable Expectation Value Sampler (OT-EVS), which achieves greater expressivity than standard EVS. By restricting the selectable observables, it is possible to use the classical shadows measurement scheme to reduce the sample complexity of our algorithm. In addition, we propose an adversarial training method adapted to the needs of OT-EVS. This training prioritizes classical updates of observables, minimizing the more costly updates of quantum circuit parameters. Numerical experiments, using an original simulation technique for correlated shot noise, confirm our model's expressivity and sample efficiency advantages compared to previous designs. We envision our proposal to encourage the exploration of continuous generative models running with few quantum resources.</p>

            <p>We propose modifying topological quantum error correcting codes by incorporating space-time defects, termed ``time vortices,'' to reduce the number of physical qubits required to achieve a desired logical error rate. A time vortex is inserted by adding a spatially varying delay to the periodic measurement sequence defining the code such that the delay accumulated on a homologically non-trivial cycle is an integer multiple of the period. We analyze this construction within the framework of the Floquet color code and optimize the embedding of the code on a torus along with the choice of the number of time vortices inserted in each direction. Asymptotically, the vortexed code requires less than half the number of qubits as the vortex-free code to reach a given code distance. We benchmark the performance of the vortexed Floquet color code by Monte Carlo simulations with a circuit-level noise model and demonstrate that the smallest vortexed code (with $30$ qubits) outperforms the vortex-free code with $42$ qubits.</p>

The consensus mechanism is based on proof of quantum work, a quantum-enhanced alternative to traditional proof of work that leverages quantum supremacy to make mining intractable for classical computers. We have refined the blockchain framework to incorporate the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, ensuring stability against sampling errors and hardware inaccuracies. To validate our approach, we implemented a prototype blockchain on four D-Wave(TM) quantum annealing processors geographically distributed within North America, demonstrating stable operation across hundreds of thousands of quantum hashing operations. Our experimental protocol follows the same approach used in the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy [King et al. Science 2025], ensuring that classical computers cannot efficiently perform the same computation task. By replacing classical machines with quantum systems for mining, it is possible to significantly reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact traditionally associated with blockchain mining while providing a quantum-safe layer of security. Beyond serving as a proof of concept for a meaningful application of quantum computing, this work highlights the potential for other near-term quantum computing applications using existing technology.</p>

            <p>In this work, we unify several quantum algorithmic frameworks for boolean functions that are based on the quantum adversary bound. First, we show that the $st$-connectivity framework subsumes the (adaptive/extended) learning graph framework, and the weighted-decision-tree framework. Additionally, we show that every randomized algorithm can be turned into an $st$-connectivity problem as well, with the same complexity up to constants. This situates the $st$-connectivity framework in between randomized and quantum algorithms, indicating that it's an intermediate computational model between classical and quantum. We also introduce a generalization of the $st$-connectivity framework, the \textit{graph composition framework}, and show that it subsumes part of the quantum divide and conquer framework, and it is itself subsumed by the multidimensional quantum walk framework. Second, we investigate these frameworks' power by investigating the most efficient algorithms they can produce, in terms of the number of queries to the input. We show that the weighted-decision-tree framework's power is polynomially related to deterministic query complexity, showing that the quantum speed-ups that can be obtained with this framework are at most quadratic. Finally, we turn our attention to time-efficient implementations of the algorithms constructed through the $st$-connectivity and graph composition frameworks. To that end, we convert instances to the two-subspace phase estimation framework, and we show how we can implement these as transducers. This has the added benefit of removing the effective spectral gap lemma from the construction, significantly simplifying the analysis. We showcase the techniques developed in this work to give improved algorithms for various string search problems.</p>

            <p>Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a state-characterization task that benchmarks coherence and experimental control in quantum systems. Existing GME tests often require joint measurements on many qubits, posing challenges for systems like time-bin encoded qubits and microwave photons from superconducting circuits, where qubit connectivity is limited or measurement noise grows with the number of jointly measured qubits. Here we introduce versatile GME and $k$-inseparability criteria applicable to any state, which only require measuring $O(n^2)$ out of $2^n$ (at most) $m$-body stabilizers of $n$-qubit target graph states, with $m$ upper-bounded by twice the graph's maximum degree. For cluster or ring-graph states, only constant-weight stabilizers are needed. Using semidefinite programming (and sometimes graph-local complementations), we can reduce the number or weight of required stabilizers. Analytical and numerical results show that our criteria are noise-robust and may infer state infidelity from certified $k$-inseparability in microwave photonic graph states generated under realistic conditions.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate non-Markovian quantum dynamics from the perspective of quantum noises in a network of atoms mediated by a waveguide. In such networks, quantum coherent feedback control becomes achievable when coherent fields (or quantum noises) in the format of photons with continuous modes propagate through the waveguide. Different from traditional Markovian quantum systems, the non-Markovian quantum network can be regarded as a quantum system interacting with multiple input quantum noise channels with different time delays, and the \rm{Itō} relationships among different quantum noise channels can be represented with a non-Markovian integral process with integral kernels determined by the distances among atoms and their coupling strengths to the waveguide. Then the non-Markovian dynamics of the quantum network can be modeled with the quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE) containing integral kernels determined by the \rm{Itō} relationships among quantum noises. Utilizing this stochastic approach related to quantum noises, the filtering of quantum states can be modulated by parameters such as atom-waveguide coupling strengths, quantum control fields, and measurement results collected at the output end of the waveguide.</p>

The primary focus of this study is the calculation of the XAS spectra of transition metal $L_{2,3}$-edges, which are dominated by strong correlation effects. First, the Fe $L_{2,3}$-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure of FePO$_4$ is calculated using a noiseless simulator. The present computation involves a comparison of three types of input states: a uniform superposition state, optimal entangled input state, and Slater function state. Subsequently, we investigated the resolution error of the QPE and statistical error attributed to the measurements. It was revealed that post-processing to introduce Lorentzian broadening reduces the statistical error, which becomes a significant problem for a large number of qubits. Subsequently, we implemented QPE on a trapped-ion quantum computer, encompassing three orbitals within the active space. To this end, we implemented QPE using dynamic circuits to reduce ancilla qubits and [[k+2, k, 2]] quantum error detection code to mitigate the quantum noise inherent in current quantum computers. As a result, it was demonstrated that hardware noise was reduced, and spectra close to the noiseless ones were obtained.</p>

However, benchmarking these states presents significant challenges: one must estimate the infidelity $\epsilon$ with multiplicative precision, while many quantum error-correcting codes only permit Clifford operations to be implemented fault-tolerantly. Consequently, conventional state tomography requires $\sim1/\epsilon^2$ samples, making benchmarking impractical for high-fidelity states. In this work, we show that any benchmarking scheme measuring one copy of the magic state per round necessarily requires $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples for single-qubit magic states. We then propose two approaches to overcome this limitation: (i) Bell measurements on two copies of the twirled state and (ii) single-copy schemes leveraging twirled multi-qubit magic states. Both benchmarking schemes utilize measurements with stabilizer states orthogonal to the ideal magic state and we show that $O(1/\epsilon)$ sample complexity is achieved, which we prove to be optimal. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our protocols through numerical simulations under realistic noise models, confirming that their advantage persists even at moderate error rates currently achievable in state-of-the-art experiments.</p>

            <h2>Flowing Through Hilbert Space: Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Lattice Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehu Martinez, Andrea Delgado</p>
            <p>Sampling from high-dimensional and structured probability distributions is a fundamental challenge in computational physics, particularly in the context of lattice field theory (LFT), where generating field configurations efficiently is critical, yet computationally intensive. In this work, we apply a previously developed hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore quantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources required compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a representative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our focus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through quantum components. This work contributes toward the development of quantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling bottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond.</p>

            <p>The use of quantum computing for machine learning is among the most promising applications of quantum technologies. Quantum models inspired by classical algorithms are developed to explore some possible advantages over classical approaches. A primary challenge in the development and testing of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms is the scarcity of datasets designed specifically for a quantum approach. Existing datasets, often borrowed from classical machine learning, need modifications to be compatible with current quantum hardware. In this work, we utilize a dataset generated by Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in a format directly compatible with the proposed quantum data process, eliminating the need for feature reduction. Among quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms, the Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) stands out for its elegant solution of projecting the data encoded in the Hilbert space into a classical space. For a prediction task concerning office room occupancy, we compare PQK with the standard Quantum Kernel (QK) and their classical counterparts to investigate how different feature maps affect the encoding of IoT data. Our findings show that the PQK demonstrates comparable effectiveness to classical methods when the proposed shallow circuit is used for quantum encoding.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Liu, Guangyao Huang, Yizhi Wang, Junjie Wu</p>
            <p>Solving quantum many-body systems is one of the most significant regimes where quantum computing applies. Currently, as a hardware-friendly computational paradigms, variational algorithms are often used for finding the ground energy of quantum many-body systems. However, running large-scale variational algorithms is challenging, because of the noise as well as the obstacle of barren plateaus. In this work, we propose the quantum version of matrix product state (qMPS), and develop variational quantum algorithms to prepare it in canonical forms, allowing to run the variational MPS method, which is equivalent to the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method, on near term quantum devices. Compared with widely used methods such as variational quantum eigensolver, this method can greatly reduce the number of qubits required, and thus can mitigate the effects of Barren Plateaus while obtain comparable or even better accuracy. Our method holds promise for distributed quantum computing, offering possibilities for fusion of different computing systems.</p>

            <p>We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action grounded in timelike correlations and pseudo-entropies</p>

Quantum criticality is a key resource for this quantum-enhanced sensing, but experimental realization has been challenging due to the complexity of ground-state preparation and the long time required to reach the steady state near criticality. Here, we experimentally demonstrate critical enhancement in a non-Hermitian topological system using a photonic quantum walk setup. Our system supports two distinct phase transitions at which enhanced sensitivity is observed even at transient times for which the Bayesian inference shows excellent estimation and precision. It is a direct demonstration of criticality-enhanced scaling laws with non-unitary dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew C. Yuan</p>
            <p>Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to modify the code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and parity checks. Motivations may include concatenating codes, embedding low-density parity check (LDPC) codes into finite-dimensional Euclidean space, or reducing the weights of parity checks. During this embedding, it is essential that the modified code possesses an isomorphic set of logical qubits as the original code. However, despite numerous explicit constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our framework.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic study of how quantum circuit design, specifically the depth of the variational ansatz and the choice of quantum feature mapping, affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on a causal classification task. The architecture combines a convolutional neural network for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical: only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning, while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability. Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models. All source codes and evaluation tools are publicly available.</p>

            <p>Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Finally, we consider how our results are impacted when the system-environment interaction leads to strict homogenisation. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to barren plateaus and sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum-circuit parameters to a classical TT network, thereby decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <p>Standard quantum measurements are projective. However, the full scope of quantum measurements is represented by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) and many of these break the limitations of projective measurements as resources in quantum information. It is therefore natural to consider how accurately an experimenter with access only to projective measurements and classical processing can simulate POVMs. The most well-known class of non-projective measurements is called symmetric informationally complete (SIC). Such measurements are both ubiquitous in the broader scope of quantum information theory and known to be the most strongly non-projective measurements in qubit systems. Here, we show that beyond qubit systems, the SIC property is in general not associated with the most non-projective measurement. For this, we put forward a semidefinite programming criterion for detecting genuinely non-projective measurements. This method allows us to determine quantitative simulability thresholds for generic POVMs and to put forward a conjecture on which qutrit and ququart measurements that are most strongly non-projective.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing M. Wang</p>
            <p>The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) addresses the quantum measurement problem by preserving unitary quantum evolution without postulating a many-worlds ontology. Its central concept is the Local Hilbert Space (LHS), an operationally isolated island of coherence within which measurement dynamics are confined. This paper develops BHSI across both experimental and conceptual frontiers. Experimentally, we propose a three-stage dual-sensing Stern-Gerlach interferometer (SGI) designed to probe the fuzzy spatiotemporal boundaries associated with LHS transitions. Stage 1 targets uncommitted timing events, manifested as sensor-detector mismatches; Stage 2 investigates conditional recoherence, a signature distinguishing time-extended local branching from instantaneous collapse or global splitting; and Stage 3 employs controlled electromagnetic phase shifts to discriminate between unitary and retrocausal recoherence mechanisms. Conceptually, we introduce the lifecycle of LHSs, describing how coherent domains emerge, persist, and fragment across physical scales. We ground this ontology in established physical precedents, drawing analogies between fuzzy LHS boundaries and phenomenological bag models in quantum field theory, and between the fragmentation of a primordial global Hilbert space in the early Universe and the fragmentation of Hilbert space in many-body systems. Together, these developments show that BHSI provides a unified, testable description of the transition from quantum inseparability to classical separability within a single physical reality.</p>

            <p>Simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems with disorder is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose a general approach -- the statistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN) -- to study such systems. By encoding disorder into an auxiliary layer and averaging separately, SeTN restores translational invariance, enabling a well-defined transfer matrix formulation. We derive a universal criterion, $n \gg \alpha^2 t^2$, linking discretization $n$, disorder strength $\alpha$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the resolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is most efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the disordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form factor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to the kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the disorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (QNS) via a quantum sensor can access $2^{n-1}$ types of $n$-th order contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) arising from different orderings of quantum operators, while classical nonlinear spectroscopy can detect only one in each order. QNS and its classical counterpart have similar spatial symmetry properties, but they are expected to have characteristically different non-spatial symmetry properties since different orderings of operators can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as exchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations extracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including particle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), chiral (S) symmetry, and time translation symmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection rules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to out-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs). The time translation symmetry leads to a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the spectra of higher-order CTOCs and OTOCs. This work discloses deep structures in higher-order quantum correlations due to non-spatial symmetries and provides access to certain types of OTOCs that are not directly observable.</p>

            <p>The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the incompatibility norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful, versatile toolkit for its application.</p>

            <p>We present the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS), a novel framework for true uniform randomness generation grounded in statistical quantum mechanics. RPSS is built on a pair of conjugate observables, the permutation count and the elapsed sorting time, whose heavy-tailed raw distributions synchronously converge to uniformity through modular reduction. This mathematically proven convergence establishes RPSS as a True Uniform Random Number Generator (TURNG). A practical implementation, QPP-RNG, demonstrates how intrinsic system jitter, arising from microarchitectural noise, memory latency, and scheduling dynamics, interacts with combinatorial complexity to yield a compact, self-stabilizing entropy source. Empirical validation under the NIST SP 800-90B framework confirms rapid entropy convergence and statistically uniform outputs. RPSS thus defines a new class of quantum-inspired entropy engines, where randomness is simultaneously harvested from unpredictable system jitter and amplified by combinatorial processes, offering a robust, platform-independent alternative to conventional entropy sources.</p>

In 2009, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd proposed an algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, demonstrating exponential speedup (under ideal conditions) with a complexity of $poly(\log N)$, in contrast to classical approaches, which in the general case exhibit a complexity of $O(N^3)$, although they can achieve $O(N)$ in specific cases involving sparse matrices. This algorithm holds promise for advancements in machine learning, the solution of differential equations, linear regression, and cryptographic analysis. However, its structure is intricate, and there is a notable lack of detailed instructional materials in the literature. In this context, this paper presents a tutorial addressing the physical and mathematical foundations of the HHL algorithm, aimed at undergraduate students, explaining its theoretical construction and its implementation for solving linear equation systems. After discussing the underlying mathematical and physical concepts, we present numerical examples that illustrate the evolution of the quantum circuit. Finally, the algorithm's complexity, limitations, and future prospects are analyzed. The examples are compared with their classical simulations, allowing for an operational assessment of the algorithm's performance.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</p>

Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions.

            <p>Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</p>

            <p>As quantum computers scale toward millions of physical qubits, it becomes essential to robustly encode individual logical qubits to ensure fault tolerance under realistic noise. A high-quality foundational encoding allows future compilation techniques and heuristics to build on optimal or near-optimal layouts, improving scalability and error resilience. In this work, we synthesize a one-dimensional shuttling bus architecture for the rotated surface code, leveraging coherent spin-qubit shuttling, following a novel methodology we name Quantum Reverse Mapping. We formulate a mixed-integer optimization model that yields optimal solutions with relatively low execution time for small code distances, and propose a scalable heuristic that matches optimal results while maintaining linear computational complexity. We evaluate the synthesized architecture using architectural metrics, such as shuttling distance and cycle time, and full quantum simulations under realistic noise models, showing that the proposed design can sustain logical error rates as low as $2\times 10^{-10}$ per round at code distance 21, showcasing its feasibility for scalable quantum error correction in spin-based quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks are a backbone of future quantum technologies thanks to their role in communication and scalable quantum computing. However, their performance is challenged by noise and decoherence. We propose a self-configuring approach that integrates superposed quantum paths with variational quantum optimization techniques. This allows networks to dynamically optimize the superposition of noisy paths across multiple nodes to establish high-fidelity connections between different parties. Our framework is in principle capable of adapting to unknown noise without requiring detailed characterization or benchmarking of the corresponding quantum channels. We also discuss the role of vacuum coherence, a quantum effect central to path superposition that impacts protocol performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach remains beneficial even in the presence of imperfections in the generation of path superposition.</p>

            <h2>Van Hove singularities in stabilizer entropy densities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Iannotti, Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Alioscia Hamma</p>
            <p>The probability distribution of a measure of non-stabilizerness, also known as magic, is investigated for Haar-random pure quantum states. Focusing on the stabilizer Rényi entropies, the associated probability density functions (PDFs) are found to display distinct non-analytic features analogous to Van Hove singularities in condensed matter systems. For a single qubit, the stabilizer purity exhibits a logarithmic divergence at a critical value corresponding to a saddle point on the Bloch sphere. This divergence occurs at the $|H\rangle$-magic states, which hence can be identified as states for which the density of non-stabilizerness in the Hilbert space is infinite. An exact expression for the PDF is derived for the case $\alpha = 2$, with analytical predictions confirmed by numerical simulations. The logarithmic divergence disappears for dimensions $d \ge 3$, in agreement with the behavior of ordinary Van Hove singularities on flat manifolds. In addition, it is shown that, for one qubit, the linear stabilizer entropy is directly related to the partial incompatibility of quantum measurements, one of the defining properties of quantum mechanics, at the basis of Stern-Gerlach experiments.</p>

            <p>Photonic systems with exceptional points, where eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates coalesce, have attracted interest due to their topological features and enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations. Non-Hermitian mode-coupling matrices provide a tractable analytic framework to model gain, loss, and chirality across optical, electronic, and mechanical platforms without the complexity of full open-system dynamics. Exceptional points define their spectral topology, and enable applications in mode control, amplification, and sensing. Yet $N$-mode couplers, the minimal setting for $N$th-order exceptional points, are often studied in specific designs that overlook their algebraic structure. We introduce a general $\mathrm{sl}(N,\mathbb{C})$ framework for arbitrary $N$-mode couplers in classical and quantum regimes, and develop it explicitly for $N=3$. This case admits algebraic diagonalization, where a propagation-dependent gauge aligns local and dynamical spectra and reveals the geometric phase connecting adiabatic and exact propagation. An exact Wei--Norman propagator captures the full dynamics and makes crossing exceptional points explicit. Our framework enables classification of coupler families. We study the family spanning $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and non-Hermitian cyclic couplers, where two exceptional points of order three lie within a continuum of exceptional points of order two, ruling out pure encircling. As an application, we study these exceptional points for a lossy three-leg beam splitter and reveal its propagation dynamics as a function of initial states, such as Fock and NOON states. Our approach provides a systematic route to analyze non-Hermitian mode couplers and guide design in classical and quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Circuit Fidelity in Transmon Qubit Rings via Operation Duration Tuning under Strong Connectivity Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quan Fu, Xin Wang, Rui Xiong</p>
            <p>Superconducting transmon qubits are a promising platform for quantum computation, yet they face significant fidelity degradation due to connectivity noise, particularly in the intermediate coupling regime where noise levels are substantial. While prior works suggest that high fidelity requires operating in regimes with strongly suppressed noise, maintaining such conditions under practical experimental constraints remains challenging. To address this, we investigate quantum gate operations in fully connected transmon rings, examining both SWAP and general circuits. Our study reveals that fidelity can be significantly enhanced by tuning gate operation durations, with local maxima emerging even under strong noise conditions. These fidelity enhancements occur consistently across different qubit numbers and operation types, and for specific initial states -- particularly those with favorable symmetry or entanglement properties -- the achieved fidelities approach quantum error correction thresholds. Furthermore, we develop a supervised machine learning model that accurately predicts the optimal operation durations for new devices, enabling efficient optimization without extensive experimental simulations. These results provide a pathway toward robust quantum circuit design in noisy experimental environments.</p>

We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sascha H. Hauck, Vladimir M. Stojanovic</p>
            <p>In view of the compelling need for coherent atom transport as a prerequisite for a variety of emerging quantum technologies, we investigate such transport on the example of an adjustable family of two-dimensional optical lattices [L. Tarruell {\em et al.}, Nature (London) {\bf 483}, 302 (2012)] that includes square, honeycomb, dimerized, and 1D-chains lattices as its special cases; dynamical optical lattices of this type have already been utilized for the demonstration of topological pumping and the realization of two-qubit quantum gates with neutral atoms. At the outset, we propose the appropriate arrangements of acousto-optic modulators that give rise to a frequency imbalance between counterpropagating laser beams, thus leading to the dynamical-lattice effect in an arbitrary direction in the lattice plane. We subsequently obtain the dynamical-lattice trajectories that enable atom transport in the lattices under consideration using two classes of control schemes: (i) shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in the form of inverse engineering based on a dynamical invariant of Lewis-Riesenfeld type, and (ii) their modification, known as enhanced STA (eSTA), which is well-suited for the treatment of anharmonic trapping potentials. We then quantify the resulting atom dynamics using transport fidelities computed from the numerical solutions of the relevant time-dependent Schrödinger equations. By doing so for various choices of the system parameters and transport directions, we demonstrate that -- except in the special case of the dimerized lattice -- the eSTA method consistently outperforms its STA counterpart, both in terms of the achievable transport times and the robustness of the resulting transport against small variations of optical-lattice depths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paarth Jain, Artur F. Izmaylov, Erik R. Kjellgren</p>
            <p>Preserving spin symmetry in variational quantum algorithms is essential for producing physically meaningful electronic wavefunctions. Implementing spin-adapted transformations on quantum hardware, however, is challenging because the corresponding fermionic generators translate into noncommuting Pauli operators. In this work, we introduce an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. These unitaries are expressed as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators. Our method exploits the fact that the elementary operators in these generators form small Lie algebras. By working in the adjoint representation of these algebras, we reformulate the factorization problem as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials. This approach enables precise numerical reparametrization of the unitaries without relying on symbolic manipulations. The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms. It preserves spin symmetry by design, reduces implementation cost, and ensures the accurate representation of electronic states in quantum simulations of molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>Closed-Loop Phase-Coherence Compensation for Superconducting Qubits Integrated Computational and Hardware Validation of the Aurora Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Futoshi Hamanoue</p>
            <p>We present an emulator-based and hardware feasibility study of Aurora-DD, a phase-coherence compensation method that integrates a sign-based feedback update of a global phase offset (Delta phi) with a fixed-depth XY8 dynamical decoupling (DD) scaffold. The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an "offline closed-loop, online open-loop" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution. Overall, the combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings.</p>

In this canonical operator frame, the uncertainty equality implies that the operator amplitude vector evolves on the unit Krylov sphere with constant speed fixed solely by the first Lanczos coefficient. This yields an exact linear bound on geometric operator evolution, independent of higher Lanczos coefficients and valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians, integrable or chaotic. Our results provide the first unified geometric interpretation of exact quantum speed limits and operator growth, identifying the first Lanczos coefficient as the intrinsic speed scale of quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</h2>

            <p>We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</p>

            <p>Estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is one of the most promising applications for quantum algorithms. Here we propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) \emph{Ansatz} for finding ground state configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions. We map CI for fermions to a quantum circuit using a subspace superposition, then apply diagonal Walsh operators to encode the wavefunction. The algorithm can be used to solve both full CI and selected CI wavefunctions, resuling in exact and near-exact solutions for electronic ground states. Both the subspace selection and wavefunction \emph{Ansatz} can be applied to any Hamiltonian that can be written in a qubit basis. The algorithm bypasses costly classical matrix diagonalizations, which is advantageous for large-scale applications. We demonstrate results for several molecules using quantum simulators and hardware.</p>

            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires extremely precise knowledge and control of qubit dynamics during the application of a gate. We develop a data-driven learning protocol for characterizing quantum gates that builds off previous work on learning the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig (NMZ) formulation of open system dynamics from time series data, which allows detailed reconstruction of quantum evolution, including non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate this learning technique on three different systems: a simulation of a qubit whose dynamics are purely Markovian, a simulation of a driven qubit coupled to stochastic noise produced by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and trapped-ion experimental data of a driven qubit whose noise environment is not characterized ahead of time. Our technique is able to learn the generators of time evolution, or the NMZ operators, in all three cases and can learn the timescale in which the qubit dynamics can no longer be accurately described by a purely Markovian model. Our technique complements existing quantum gate characterization methods such as gate set tomography by explicitly capturing non-Markovianity in the gate generator, thus allowing for more thorough diagnosis of noise sources.</p>

            <p>The spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis is motivated by some outstanding issues in standard quantum mechanics, including the problem of quantum measurement. The current study compares between some possible methods that can be used to implement the hypothesis. Disentanglement is formulated using a nonlinear operator, which can be used to modify both the Schrödinger equation for the quantum state vector, and the master equation for the density operator. Two types of nonlinear disentanglement operators are explored. The first one gives rise to matrix deranking, and the second one to correlation suppression. Both types are demonstrated using a two spin system that is driven close to the Hartmann--Hahn double resonance. It is shown that limit cycle steady state solutions, which are excluded by standard quantum mechanics, become possible in the presence of disentanglement.</p>

            <p>In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. This approach alleviates bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, thereby circumventing transport in mediating one-exciton states. The evolution of these population distributions and cascading transitions can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources with multidimensional photon correlation spectroscopy allows promising applications in spectroscopy and sensing.</p>

The nature of this difficulty will be laid out at the outset. A resolution then will be presented, in which the Born rule will be lightly amended so as to correctly predict all probabilities. The resolution will have the further benefit of clarifying how quantum theory applies to an array of situations in which the theory can be ambiguous, such as the descriptions of continuous measurements, and of closed systems containing all observers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adriano Macarone-Palmieri, Rosario Lo Franco</p>
            <p>Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For the 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorems to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.</p>

            <p>We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \eta^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $\eta$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Wei Tseng, Yu-Ting Kao, Yeong-Jar Chang, Jia-Han Ou, Wen-Zhi Zhang, Jin-Jia Wang, Yung-Hsiang Lin</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a new method that combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum-inspired techniques to improve the efficiency of multi-variable optimization experiments. By using advanced software simulations, this approach significantly reduces the time and cost compared to traditional physical experiments. The research focuses on enzyme fermentation, demonstrating that this method can achieve better results with fewer experiments. The findings highlight the potential of this approach to more effectively identify optimal formulations, leading to advancements in enzyme fermentation and other fields that require complex optimization. Initially, the Active Ingredients (AIN) could not be improved even after 600 experiments. However, by adopting the method outlined in this paper, we were able to identify a better formula in just 405 experiments. This resulted in an increase of AIN from 8481 to 10068, representing an improvement of 18.7%.</p>

            <h2>Super-Tonks-Girardeau Quench in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</h2>

            <p>We investigate the effect of a quench from a one-dimensional gas with strong and repulsive local interactions to a strongly attractive one, known as the super-Tonks-Girardeau effect. By incorporating both an optical lattice and non-local interactions (specifically nearest-neighbor), we discover a previously unexplored phenomenon: the disruption of the state during the quench, but within a specific range of interactions. Our study employs the extended Bose-Hubbard model across various system sizes, starting with analytical results for two atoms and progressing to few-body systems using exact diagonalization, DMRG and TDVP methods. Finally, we use a numerical implementation of the local density approximation for a macroscopic number of atoms. Consistently, our findings unveil a region where the initially self-bound structure expands due to the super-Tonks-Girardeau quench. The fast evaporation provides a tool to characterize the phase diagram in state-of-art experiments exploring the physics of the extended Bose-Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Curve fitting on a quantum annealer for an advanced navigation method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Isserstedt, Daniel Jaroszewski, Wolfgang Mergenthaler, Felix Paul, Bastian Harrach</p>
            <p>We explore the applicability of quantum annealing to the approximation task of curve fitting. To this end, we consider a function that shall approximate a given set of data points and is written as a finite linear combination of standardized functions, e.g., orthogonal polynomials. Consequently, the decision variables subject to optimization are the coefficients of that expansion. Although this task can be accomplished classically, it can also be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is suited to be solved with quantum annealing. Given the size of the problem stays below a certain threshold, we find that quantum annealing yields comparable results to the classical solution. Regarding a real-world use case, we discuss the problem to find an optimized speed profile for a vessel using the framework of dynamic programming and outline how the aforementioned approximation task can be put into play. Similar to the curve fitting task, our findings indicate that quantum annealing is currently only feasible if the routing problem is modeled sufficiently small and sparse.</p>

            <h2>Creative and geometric times in physics, mathematics, logic, and philosophy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Del Santo, Nicolas Gisin</p>
            <p>We distinguish two different concepts of time that play a role in physics: \textit{geometric time} and \textit{creative time}. The former is the time of deterministic physics and merely parametrizes a given evolution. The latter is instead characterized by real change, i.e. novel information that gets created when a non-necessary event becomes determinate in a fundamentally indeterministic physics. This allows one to give a naturalistic characterization of the present as the moment that separates the potential future from the determinate past. We discuss how these two concepts find natural applications in classical and intuitionistic mathematics, respectively, and in classical and intuitionistic logic, as well as how they relate to the well-known A- and B-theories in the philosophy of time. We acknowledge that we do not offer here a unified concept or a new philosophy of time. However, we contend that none of the existing philosophical accounts fully integrate both the geometric and creative concepts of time.</p>

            <h2>Does connected wedge imply distillable entanglement?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Mori, Beni Yoshida</p>
            <p>The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two boundary subsystems $A$ and $C$ can exhibit large mutual information $I(A:C)$ even when they are spatially disconnected on the boundary and separated by a buffer subsystem $B$, as long as $A$ and $C$ have connected entanglement wedge in the bulk. However, whether the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ contains distillable EPR pairs has remained a longstanding open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by showing that: i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at leading order in $G_N$, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement in a holographic mixed state $\rho_{AC}$, and ii) one-shot, one-way LOCC-distillable entanglement is given at leading order by locally accessible information $J^W(A|C)$, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system $B$ via $J^W(A|C) = S_A - E^W(A:B)$. Namely, we demonstrate that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement in one-shot, one-way LOCC. We also show that entanglement of formation $E_{F}(A:C)$ is given by $E^W(A:C)$ at leading order in holography.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pravin Kumar Dahal, Kieran Hymas</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the future and left Rindler wedges of Minkowski spacetime are entangled, leading to the Unruh effect. Similarly, the past and right Rindler wedges are also entangled. We propose a protocol to extract this entanglement using two two-state detectors located in the past and right Rindler wedges. By scaling the detector transition frequencies inversely with Minkowski time, entanglement from the quantum field is transferred to the detectors, suggesting they may support quantum teleportation via the vacuum. Our protocol can be implemented with current quantum systems, such as flux-tunable transmon qubits. This research provides new insights into the entanglement properties of spacetime and hints at practical applications for secure quantum information transfer using the vacuum state of a quantum field.</p>

            <h2>One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiga Nakamoto, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji</p>
            <p>We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p>

            <p>Fluctuation theorems establish that thermodynamic processes at the microscale can occasionally result in negative entropy production. At the microscale, another distinct possibility becomes more likely: processes where no entropy is produced overall. In this work, we explore the constraints imposed by such null-entropy events on the fluctuations of thermodynamic currents. By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems. We validate this framework using an example of a qudit SWAP engine.</p>

            <h2>Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S Rahul, Giandomenico Palumbo</p>
            <p>Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that the zero indirect band gap in the real part of the spectrum remains stable in the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the parameter regime in which this robustness persists. We find that the appearance of the zero indirect gap coincides with the suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.</p>

            <p>Fraunhofer diffraction plays a vital role in experimental physics not only because it accurately describes the behaviour of light in the usual propagation limit, but also because it links the diffracted light with the scattering object through one of the most important mathematical transformations in physics: the Fourier transform. Acting as a probe in material characterisation as well as used as a tool for particle trapping or sensing, the pattern of interference maxima resulting from the Fraunhofer diffraction through periodic scattering is an ubiquitous routine. In this paper we analyse the Fraunhofer diffraction resulting from the much less studied aperiodic scatter of the light. We provide general conditions for the experimental observation of the peaks of interference maxima featured into patterns that display periodic structures on a number of distance scales. Our theoretical analysis is supported by thorough experimental demonstrations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snigdh Sabharwal, Matthias Gohlke, Paul Skrzypczyk, Nic Shannon</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</p>

So far, only restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions, satisfying particular structural properties, have allowed the analysis of microlocal properties. We first extend the microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions, including the well-known Kohn-Nirenberg quantization, and examine these findings in the framework of Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase. Finally, we analyze the phase space concentration of the (cross) Wigner distribution arising from the interaction of two states, with particular attention to interactions generated by certain Schrödinger evolutions. These contributions enable a more refined study of the so-called ghost frequencies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Wilson</p>
            <p>We establish a correspondence between equivalence classes of agent-state policies for deterministic POMDPs and one-input process functions (the classical-deterministic limit of higher-order quantum operations). We use this correspondence to build a bridge between the agent-environment interaction in artificial intelligence, causal structure in the foundations of physics, and logic in computer science. We construct a *-autonomous category PF of types which supports an interpretation of one-step evaluation of policies, and multi-agent observation constraints, into cuts and monoidal products. In terms of types, we develop the correspondence further by identifying observation-independent decentralised POMDPs as the natural domain for the multi-input process functions used to model indefinite causality. We then prove a strict separation between general multi-input process function and definite-ordered process function performance on such dec-POMDPs, by finding an instance for which policies utilizing an indefinite causal structure can achieve greater finite-horizon rewards than policies which are restricted to a fixed background causal structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Hua Yu</p>
            <p>We introduce the two-point propagation field (TPPF), a real-valued, phase-sensitive quantity defined as the functional derivative of the single-photon detection probability with respect to an infinitesimal opaque perturbation placed between source and detection slits. The TPPF is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a stable, high-frequency sinusoidal structure (6.7 nm period) near the detection slit. This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development. The TPPF concept, originally developed in a perturbative study of single-particle propagation, thus bridges fundamental quantum measurement questions with practical high-resolution X-ray metrology and imaging.</p>

            <h2>Distribution-Guided and Constrained Quantum Machine Unlearning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nausherwan Malik, Zubair Khalid, Muhammad Faryad</p>
            <p>Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.</p>

We prove a previously conjectured property of all such constraints: Any $k$ systems on the "greater-than" side of the inequality whose overlap is nonempty are subsumed in some $k$ systems on its "less-than" side (accounting for multiplicity). This finding adds evidence that the same inequalities also constrain the entropies under time-dependent conditions because it preempts a large class of potential counterexamples. We prove several other properties of holographic entropy inequalities and comment on their relation to quantum erasure correction and the Renormalization Group.</p>

            <p>We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</p>

            <p>Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</p>

            <h2>"It from Bit": The Hartle-Hawking state and quantum mechanics for de Sitter observers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Zhao</p>
            <p>The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper, we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of $\alpha$-sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe. The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and carries no quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates two logically distinct structures and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of "It from Bit." We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way, we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.</p>

            <p>We present the first quantum-simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states within a QCD-inspired chiral quark model. An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.</p>

            <p>Analog quantum simulators and digital quantum computers are two distinct paradigms driving near-term applications in modern quantum science, from probing many-body phenomena to identifying computational advantage over classical systems. A transformative opportunity on the horizon is merging the high-fidelity many-body evolution in analog simulators with the robust control and measurement of digital machines. Such a hybrid platform would unlock new capabilities in state preparation, characterization and dynamical control. Here, we embed digital quantum control in the analog evolution of a synthetic quantum material by entangling the lattice potential landscape of a Bose-Hubbard circuit with an ancilla qubit. This Hamiltonian-level control induces dynamics under a superposition of different lattice configurations and guides the many-body system to novel strongly-correlated states where different phases of matter coexist -- ordering photons into superpositions of solid and fluid eigenstates. Leveraging hybrid control modalities, we adiabatically introduce disorder to localize the photons into an entangled cat state and enhance its coherence using a many-body echo technique. This work illustrates the potential for entangling quantum computers with quantum matter -- synthetic and solid-state -- for advantage in sensing and materials characterization.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body systems driven far from equilibrium can exhibit chaos, entanglement, and non-classical correlations, yet directly observing these phenomena in large, closed quantum systems remains challenging. Here we realize the Dicke model -- a fundamental description of light-matter interactions -- in a two-dimensional crystal of approximately 100 trapped ions. The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body Rényi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals. Our results establish large ion crystals as scalable analog quantum simulators of non-equilibrium light-matter dynamics and provide a controlled platform for experimental studies of information scrambling and entanglement in closed many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.</p>

            <p>The PL6 color center in silicon carbide has recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing, yet its coherent spin--photon interface has remained largely unexplored. Here we present a comprehensive investigation of single PL6 centers, combining spectroscopy with theoretical analysis. The excited-state fine structure is fully resolved using group-theoretical modeling and strain-dependent measurements. Under resonant excitation, we achieve a spin initialization fidelity of $99.69 \pm 0.03\%$ and a readout contrast of $98.31 \pm 1.03\%$. The spin--photon--entangled $A_2$ transition exhibits narrow optical linewidths ($\sim 180$~MHz) and a polarization visibility of $\sim 82\%$. Coherent optical driving enables Rabi frequencies up to $2.895$~GHz, while dynamical decoupling extends the spin coherence time from $0.5$~ms to $5.70$~ms. Our results establish PL6 as a competitive solid-state spin--photon interface hosted in a commercially available semiconductor platform.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Quantum and Semi-Classical Thermodynamics in Cavity QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcelo Janovitch, Sander Stammbach, Matteo Brunelli, Patrick P. Potts</p>
            <p>In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), photons leaving the cavity can be irreversibly lost or reused as a power source. This dichotomy is reflected in two different thermodynamic bookkeepings of the light field, both corresponding to valid thermodynamic frameworks. In this work, we formulate a rigorous semi-classical limit of cavity QED and show that the resulting thermodynamic description may qualitatively differ from that of the fully quantised model. We find that violations of the thermodynamic uncertainty relations are recovered in the semi-classical limit only by one of the two thermodynamic frameworks: the one which treats part of the photon flux as a power source. We illustrate our findings in a three-level system coupled to a driven cavity.</p>

            <p>Universal quantum computing requires an architecture that supports both linear circuits and, crucially, strong nonlinear resources. For quantum photonic systems, integrating such nonlinearities with scalable linear circuitry has been a major bottleneck, leaving most optical experiments without nonlinear operations and, consequently, incapable of achieving universality. Here, we report an extensible photonic computer that supports a universal gate set by seamlessly combining fully programmable, scalable linear optical networks with integrated nonlinear modules. This platform enables a broad range of quantum computing and simulation tasks. We demonstrate the quasi-deterministic generation of optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, which are essential resources for bosonic error correction, yet had previously been realized only probabilistically. Furthermore, we simulate complex many-body quantum dynamics, exemplified by the Bose-Hubbard model. Such quantum simulation tasks have long been considered beyond the reach of photonic hardware limited to linear operations. These capabilities, enabled by our extensible architecture, establish a viable route towards photonic quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Efficient and bright single photon sources on photonic chips are key to scaling quantum technologies. Spontaneous four wave mixing in micro-ring resonators creates excellent narrowband and tunable photon sources. We experimentally demonstrate the optimization of heralding efficiency and brightness by tuning the coupling of the pump, signal and idler modes into the resonator whilst operating in a pulsed pump regime. We observe a maximum detected pair rate of over 93,000~coincidences per second in a moderately over-coupled regime, alongside a high intrinsic idler heralding efficiency of 97.87$\pm$8.97\% when operating close to maximal over-coupling. The measured dependence on coupling strength is in strong agreement with theoretical predictions, experimentally validating the predicted trade-off between brightness and heralding efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandra Sierant, Diana Méndez-Avalos, Santiago Tabares Giraldo, Morgan W. Mitchell</p>
            <p>We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid dc-rf optically pumped magnetometer (hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble, the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a nontrivial interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between $S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on readout quantum noise and measurement back-action. These results demonstrate quantum-enhanced sensitivity in a continuously operating multi-parameter sensor and reveal fundamental trade-offs between sensitivity, back-action, and bandwidth.</p>

            <p>In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $\pi$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli</p>
            <p>We introduce the Krylov distribution $\mathcal{D}(\xi)$, a static Krylov-space diagnostic that characterizes how inverse-energy response is organized in Hilbert space. The central object is the resolvent-dressed state $(H-\xi)^{-1}|\psi_0\rangle$, whose decomposition in the Krylov basis generated from a reference state defines a normalized distribution over Krylov levels. Unlike conventional spectral functions, which resolve response solely along the energy axis, the Krylov distribution captures how the resolvent explores the dynamically accessible subspace as the spectral parameter $\xi$ is varied. Using asymptotic analysis, exact results in solvable models, and numerical studies of an interacting spin chain, we identify three universal regimes: saturation outside the spectral support, extensive growth within continuous spectra, and sublinear or logarithmic scaling near spectral edges and quantum critical points. We further show that fidelity susceptibility and the quantum geometric tensor admit natural decompositions in terms of Krylov-resolved resolvent amplitudes.</p>

            <h2>Extracting Many-Body Quantum Resources within One-Body Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos L. Benavides-Riveros, Tomasz Wasak, Alessio Recati</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states. By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions. Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal 1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.</p>

            <h2>Theory of quantum error mitigation for non-Clifford gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Layden, Bradley Mitchell, Karthik Siva</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation techniques mimic noiseless quantum circuits by running several related noisy circuits and combining their outputs in particular ways. How well such techniques work is thought to depend strongly on how noisy the underlying gates are. Weakly-entangling gates, like $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ for small angles $\theta$, can be much less noisy than entangling Clifford gates, like CNOT and CZ, and they arise naturally in circuits used to simulate quantum dynamics. However, such weakly-entangling gates are non-Clifford, and are therefore incompatible with two of the most prominent error mitigation techniques to date: probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and the related form of zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). This paper generalizes these techniques to non-Clifford gates, and comprises two complementary parts. The first part shows how to effectively transform any given quantum channel into (almost) any desired channel, at the cost of a sampling overhead, by adding random Pauli gates and processing the measurement outcomes. This enables us to cancel or properly amplify noise in non-Clifford gates, provided we can first characterize such gates in detail. The second part therefore introduces techniques to do so for noisy $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates. These techniques are robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and exhibit concentration and sensitivity--crucial statistical properties for many experiments. They are related to randomized benchmarking, and may also be of interest beyond the context of error mitigation. We find that while non-Clifford gates can be less noisy than related Cliffords, their noise is fundamentally more complex, which can lead to surprising and sometimes unwanted effects in error mitigation. Whether this trade-off can be broadly advantageous remains to be seen.</p>

            <h2>Charge-$4e$ superconductor with parafermionic vortices: A path to universal topological quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyan Darius Shi, Zhaoyu Han, Srinivas Raghu, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $\nu=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in strong x-ray laser techniques enable the study of nonlinear multiphoton ionization in extreme high-frequency fields. Although the stabilization regime in such fields is theoretically established, its modified properties in the nondipole regime for long laser pulses remains unknown. Here, we numerically investigate the strong-field ionization of an atom in a long XUV laser pulse in the nondipole regime. Our study of the time-dependent quantum dynamics reveals a quasiperiodic modulation of the ionization yield as a function of pulse duration. We demonstrate that the Coulomb-field-induced slow oscillation of the ionized electron wave packet during the interaction is responsible for the observed modulation of the ionization yield. Furthermore, we scrutinize the unusual photon momentum sharing between the photoelectron and the ion in this extreme regime. These effects are observable in upcoming x-ray free-electron laser facilities.</p>

            <p>Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuya Chiba, Yasushi Yoneta, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Akira Shimizu</p>
            <p>The second law of thermodynamics for adiabatic operations -- constraints on state transitions in closed systems under external control -- is one of the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. On the other hand, it is recently established that even pure quantum states can represent thermal equilibrium. However, pure quantum states do not satisfy the second law in that they are not passive, i.e., work can be extracted from them if arbitrary unitary operations are allowed. It therefore remains unresolved how quantum mechanics can be reconciled with thermodynamics. Here, based on our key quantum-mechanical notions of thermal equilibrium and adiabatic operations, we address the emergence of the second law for adiabatic operations in the thermodynamics limit. We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results.</p>

            <p>We investigate the two-port scattering process in non-Hermitian dimer models via quantum measurements using external leads. We focus on two exemplary dimer models that preserve parity-time symmetry via spatial gain-loss balance and exhibit non-reciprocity due to directional hopping. The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We study the properties of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model under chord Hamiltonian deformations based on finite cutoff holography for general dilaton gravity theories with Dirichlet boundaries. The formalism immediately incorporates a lower-dimensional analog of $\text{T}\bar{\text{T}}(+\Lambda_2)$ deformations, denoted $T^2(+\Lambda_1)$, as special cases. In general, the deformation mixes the chord basis of the Hilbert space in the seed theory, which we order through a modification of the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting chord number in the ordered basis represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; the growth of complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. By performing a sequence of $T^2$ and $T^2+\Lambda_1$ deformations in the upper tail of the energy spectrum in the deformed DSSYK, we concretely realize the cosmological stretched horizon proposal in de Sitter holography by Susskind. We discuss other extensions with sine dilaton gravity, end-of-the-world branes, and the Almheiri-Goel-Hu model.</p>

            <p>Machine learning in clinical settings must balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy. Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.</p>

Among various applications, diamond magnetometers can demonstrate high sensitivity magnetic sensing within millimeter-scale size for endoscopic applications. However, the trade-off between sensitivity and spatial resolution of diamond magnetometry makes it difficult to achieve such a probe. In this study, we present a millimeter-scale rigid diamond magnetometer probe with enhanced sensitivity via optimizing the optical design. By coupling the frustum diamond with the miniaturized compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) lens, we enhance the fluorescence collection efficiency by 37% within 4 mm diameter, and the achieved sensitivity is 200 pT/Hz1/2 based on the sample with the resonance linewidth of ~8 MHz. With this verified structure, endoscopes with mm-size probe and picotesla sensitivity can be projected for surgical and industrial applications in the future.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the connection between causality and many-body dynamics by studying the algebraic structure of tri-partite unitaries ('walls') which permanently arrest local operator spreading in their time-periodic evolution. We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor. Our results offer a rigorous understanding of locally constrained quantum dynamics from a quantum information perspective.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Sieve Tracer: A Hybrid Framework for Layer-Wise Activation Tracing in Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Pan</p>
            <p>Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer the internal computations of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet separating sparse semantic signals from high-dimensional polysemantic noise remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Quantum Sieve Tracer, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to characterize factual recall circuits. We implement a modular pipeline that first localizes critical layers using classical causal tracing, then maps specific attention head activations into an exponentially large quantum Hilbert space. Using open-weight models (Meta Llama-3.2-1B and Alibaba Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct), we perform a two-stage analysis that reveals a fundamental architectural divergence. While Qwen's layer 7 circuit functions as a classic Recall Hub, we discover that Llama's layer 9 acts as an Interference Suppression circuit, where ablating the identified heads paradoxically improves factual recall. Our results demonstrate that quantum kernels can distinguish between these constructive (recall) and reductive (suppression) mechanisms, offering a high-resolution tool for analyzing the fine-grained topology of attention.</p>

            <h2>Consensus Protocols for Entanglement-Aware Scheduling in Distributed Quantum Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Mahdi Chehimi, Felix Burt, Kin K. Leung</p>
            <p>The realization of distributed quantum neural networks (DQNNs) over quantum internet infrastructures faces fundamental challenges arising from the fragile nature of entanglement and the demanding synchronization requirements of distributed learning. We introduce a Consensus-Entanglement-Aware Scheduling (CEAS) framework that co-designs quantum consensus protocols with adaptive entanglement management to enable robust synchronous training across distributed quantum processors. CEAS integrates fidelity-weighted aggregation, in which parameter updates are weighted by quantum Fisher information to suppress noisy contributions, with decoherence-aware entanglement scheduling that treats Bell pairs as perishable resources subject to exponential decay. The framework incorporates quantum-authenticated Byzantine fault tolerance, ensuring security against malicious nodes while maintaining compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) constraints. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees under heterogeneous noise conditions, while numerical simulations demonstrate that CEAS maintains 10-15 percentage points higher accuracy compared to entanglement-oblivious baselines under coordinated Byzantine attacks, achieving 90 percent Bell-pair utilization despite coherence time limitations. This work provides a foundational architecture for scalable distributed quantum machine learning, bridging quantum networking, distributed optimization, and early fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>To reduce circuit depth when executing Quantum algorithms, it is necessary to maximize qubit connectivity on a near-term quantum processor. While addressing this, we also need to ensure high gate fidelity, suppression of unwanted ZZ cross-talk, a compact layout footprint, and minimal control hardware complexity to support scalability. In current superconducting quantum chips, fixed coupling is used as it is easier to scale, but it is limited by unwanted static ZZ interaction during single qubit operations, which degrades system performance. To overcome these challenges, we have introduced a first-of-its-kind hybrid tunable-coupling architecture that connects four fixed-frequency transmon qubits using a single coupler. This hybrid coupler uses off-resonant Stark drives to tune ZZ strength between qubit pairs. Experimentally backed simulation results indicate that our proposed hybrid design maximizes the qubit connectivity while reducing control overhead. This design achieves a near 20% reduction in circuit depth compared to IBM's Heavy-Hexagonal layout, showing its potential for scalability.</p>

            <p>We report a normal-mode induced synchronization blockade in coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators under the influence of external drive. In this mechanism, the coupling hybridizes the oscillator modes into spectrally split normal modes. The destructive interference between the transitions to these modes blocks synchronization. We find that this blockade can be controlled simply by tuning the coupling strength and detuning allowing dynamic manipulation of quantum synchronization through collective mode dynamics. We analyze the phase-locking behaviour using perturbation analysis. Further, by deriving steady-state probability amplitudes we show how the energy redistribution and spectral splitting forms the basis of the blockade. Our results might provide new insights into how synchronization can be controlled in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Robust quantum transmission is driving a new paradigm in space-ground quantum networking. Although phase encoding has been widely adopted in terrestrial fiber channels, it has long been considered unsuitable for free-space quantum communication. Here, we demonstrate phase-encoded quantum communication over 1400 m of urban free space. The system maintained stable operation for nearly one hour, achieving 99.07% interference visibility and an average quantum bit error rate of 2.38%. The free-space quantum states were directly coupled into the fiber and transmitted over an additional 10 km, confirming seamless interoperability across different media. We further show that turbulence-induced phase drifts between successive picosecond pulses can be effectively compensated. A cascaded-link model and numerical simulations indicate feasibility over free-space distances exceeding 30 km, underscoring the potential for satellite-to-ground quantum links. This work establishes the viability of phase encoding in free-space quantum networks, simplifying cross-medium integration and enabling compatibility with existing classical infrastructures.</p>

Instead of targeting to represent the entire state, we promote the reduced density matrices to our variables and enforce the constraints that are imposed on them by consistency with a global steady state. The resulting constraints have the form of a semidefinite program, which allows us to efficiently bound the values a given expectation value can take in the steady state. Our results show fast convergence of the bounds with the size of the reduced density matrices, giving very competitive predictions for the steady state of several one- and two-dimensional models for an arbitrary number of particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Waqas Haseeb, Mohamad Toutounji</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of ligand--receptor electron transfer and conformational response in a prototypical viral binding complex, using the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein bound to the human ACE2 receptor as a model system. Treating the ACE2--Spike interface as an open quantum system embedded in a biological environment, we simulate how vibrational interactions and environmental memory reshape the coupled receptor--ligand dynamics and modulate vibrationally assisted electron transfer (VA-ET). Using a Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr"odinger Equation (NMSSE) approach, we simulate electron transfer between donor and acceptor states in ACE2 modulated by a specific vibrational mode of the Spike protein. The influence of environmental memory (non-Markovian dynamics) and non-Condon effects (vibrational modulation of electronic coupling) are analyzed in detail. In the Markovian limit with an Ohmic bath, population dynamics reduce to exponential kinetics, and extracted transfer rates agree with semiclassical Marcus--Jortner predictions in the appropriate regime. Beyond the Markovian, high-temperature limit, we observe clear deviations: non-exponential decay, coherent oscillatory features, and enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational frequency. Incorporating off-diagonal system--bath coupling alongside diagonal coupling shows that nuclear motion can dynamically gate electron tunneling, sharpening the frequency selectivity of the VA-ET mechanism. Finally, a structured (sub-Ohmic) environmental spectral density with long-lived correlations (``memory'') preserves electronic--vibrational coherence over longer times, amplifying vibrational selectivity under non-Condon coupling. Our results support the proposition that ACE2--Spike binding may exploit vibrational assistance and quantum coherence as a molecular recognition mechanism.</p>

We demonstrate that the required shearing strength for the protocol, which scales linearly with time, decreases with increasing number of atoms ($N$) in proportion to $1/\sqrt{N}$. The resulting states exhibit optimal quantum Fisher information, making them ideal for surpassing the classical limit of phase sensitivity in quantum metrology applications. Notably, our protocol is compatible with a time-reversal strategy for quantum metrology, ensuring its practical viability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Heisenberg limit scaling remains intact even when reducing the twisting employed in tandem with the number of atoms, thereby mitigating realistic losses such as photon scattering.</p>

            <p>Radiation impacts are a current challenge with computing on superconducting-based quantum devices because they can lead to widespread correlated errors across the device. Such errors can be problematic for quantum error correction (QEC) codes, which are generally designed to correct independent errors. To address this, we have developed a computational model to simulate the effects of radiation impacts on QEC performance. This is achieved by building from recently developed models of quasiparticle density, mapping radiation-induced qubit error rates onto a quantum error channel and simulation of a simple surface code. We also provide a performance metric to quantify the resilience of a QEC code to radiation impacts. Additionally, we sweep various parameters of chip design to test mitigation strategies for improved QEC performance. Our model approach is holistic, allowing for modular performance testing of error mitigation strategies and chip and code designs.</p>

            <p>We present a hybrid classical-quantum image preparation scheme that reduces the quantum implementation cost of image loading for quantum pixel information encoding (QPIE). The proposed method, termed JPEG-assisted QPIE (JQPIE), loads only the quantized JPEG coefficients into a quantum register, leading to substantial reductions in \texttt{CX} gate count and circuit depth while preserving reconstruction quality comparable to classical JPEG compression. We develop two variants of the hybrid strategy. The first realizes the complete JPEG decompression pipeline coherently by implementing inverse quantization via a block-encoded unitary operator. The second, referred to as \emph{quantization-free JQPIE} (QF-JQPIE), omits quantization altogether, thereby avoiding the probabilistic nature of block-encoded quantization. Numerical simulations on standard benchmark image datasets (USC--SIPI and Kodak) demonstrate that both variants achieve significant constant-factor reductions in \texttt{CX} gate count and circuit depth relative to direct QPIE loading, while maintaining high reconstruction quality as measured by PSNR and SSIM.</p>

We benchmark the measured output biases against ideal predictions and discuss the impact of device noise. Our results establish a simple, resource-efficient experimental primitive for quantum-to-classical randomness processing and support the viability of quantum Bernoulli factories for quantum-enhanced stochastic simulation and sampling tasks.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing offers an alternative paradigm for addressing combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical computing. Despite recent hardware improvements, the execution of empirical quantum optimization experiments at scales known to be hard for state-of-the-art classical solvers is not yet in reach. In this work, we offer a different way to approach combinatorial optimization with near-term quantum computing. Motivated by the promising results observed in using quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) for approximating complicated probability distributions, we combine ideas of sampling from the device with QeMCMC together with warm-starting and parallel tempering, in the context of combinatorial optimization. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm recovers the global optima for instances of the Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS) up to 117 decision variables using 117 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We show early evidence of a scaling advantage of our algorithm compared to similar classical methods for the chosen instances of MIS. MIS is practically relevant across domains like financial services and molecular biology, and, in some cases, already difficult to solve to optimality classically with only a few hundred decision variables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ofelia B. Oña, Gustavo E. Massaccesi, Pablo Capuzzi, Luis Lain, Alicia Torre, Juan E. Peralta, Diego R. Alcoba, Gustavo E. Scuseria</p>
            <p>The N-representability problem for reduced density matrices remains a fundamental challenge in electronic structure theory. Following our previous work that employs a unitary-evolution algorithm based on an adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter variational quantum algorithm to probe pure-state N-representability of reduced density matrices [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9968], in this work we propose a practical framework for determining the ensemble N-representability of a p-body matrix. This is accomplished using a purification strategy consisting of embedding an ensemble state into a pure state defined on an extended Hilbert space, such that the reduced density matrices of the purified state reproduce those of the original ensemble. By iteratively applying variational unitaries to an initial purified state, the proposed algorithm minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between its p-body reduced density matrix and a specified target p-body matrix, which serves as a measure of the N-representability of the target. This methodology facilitates both error correction of defective ensemble reduced density matrices, and quantum-state reconstruction on a quantum computer, offering a route for density-matrix refinement. We validate the algorithm with numerical simulations on systems of two, three, and four electrons in both, simple models as well as molecular systems at finite temperature, demonstrating its robustness.</p>

            <p>We propose a method for directly measuring the quantum mechanical pseudo-distribution of observable properties via its characteristic function. Vandermonde matrices of the eigenvalues play a central role in the theory. This proposal directly finds the pseudo-distribution using weak measurements of the generator of position moments (momentum translations). While the pseudo-distribution can be extracted from the data in a theory-agnostic way, it is shown that under quantum-mechanical formalism, the predicted pseudo-distribution is identified with the Kirkwood-Dirac pseudo-distribution. We discuss the construction of both the joint pseudo-distribution and a conditional pseudo-distribution, which is closely connected to weak-value physics. By permuting position and momentum measurements, we give a prescription to directly probe the canonical commutation relation and verify it for any quantum state. This work establishes the theory of a characteristic function approach to pseudo-distributions, as well as providing a constructive approach to measuring them directly.</p>

            <p>Reliable preparation of many-body ground states is an essential task in quantum computing, with applications spanning areas from chemistry and materials modeling to quantum optimization and benchmarking. A variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, including variational methods. However, variational training often struggle to navigate complex energy landscapes, frequently encountering suboptimal local minima or suffering from barren plateaus. In this work, we introduce an iterative strategy for ground-state preparation based on a stepwise (discretized) Hamiltonian deformation. By complementing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with adiabatic principles, we demonstrate that solving a sequence of intermediate problems facilitates tracking the ground-state manifold toward the target system, even as we scale the system size. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving a lower bound on the loss variance that suggests trainability throughout the deformation, provided the system remains away from gap closings. Numerical simulations, including the effects of shot noise, confirm that this path-dependent tracking consistently converges to the target ground state.</p>

In this work, we reformulate the gravitationally mediated interaction phase in a conformally invariant twistor framework in which no notion of spacetime distance is assumed. We show that the bilocal phase responsible for entanglement generation remains well-defined and non-factorizable even in the absence of spacetime geometry. The familiar Newtonian $1/r$ phase, relevant for QGEM protocols, arises only after the conformal invariance is broken by introducing the infinity twistor, which selects a particular spacetime representation of the underlying bilocal quantum interaction. Our results isolate the genuinely quantum content of QGEM protocols and clarify the contingent role played by spacetime geometry in mediating entanglement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huining Zhang, X. X. Yi</p>
            <p>The quantum Fisher information of a quantum state with respect to a certain parameter quantifies the sensitivity of the quantum state to changes in that parameter. Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2. Considering large spin probes can achieve a larger quantum Fisher information, offering enhanced metrological advantage, we here utilize the entanglement between a large spin probe and an ancilla to achieve optimal quantum Fisher information for estimating the rotation angle, without prior knowledge of the rotation axis. Different from the previous spin-1/2 case, achieving the optimal precision with large spins generally requires post-selection, resulting in a success probability dependent on the dimension of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we extend the encoding state from the maximally entangled case to general entangled states, showing that optimal metrology can still be achieved with a certain success probability.</p>

            <p>We study the sample complexity of shadow tomography in the high-precision regime under realistic measurement constraints. Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$ and a known set of observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\{\mathrm{tr}(O_i\rho)\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $\epsilon$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $\rho$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $\epsilon$ is below an instance-dependent threshold. Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$, where $\Gamma_p$ is a function of $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i O_i$ with $\|\alpha\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $\Theta(\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_p/\epsilon^2)$. We then show $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_\infty = \Gamma_\infty$. In both cases, allowing $c$-copy measurements improves the sample complexity by at most $\Omega(1/c)$. Our results establish a quantitative correspondence between quantum learning and metrology, unifying asymptotic metrological limits with finite-sample learning guarantees.</p>

            <p>Simulating quantum many-body systems (QMBS) is one of the long-standing, highly non-trivial challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information due to the exponentially growing size of the system's Hilbert space. To date, tensor networks have been an essential tool for studying such quantum systems, owing to their ability to efficiently capture the entanglement properties of the systems they represent. One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes.

In this work, we present and discuss the behavior of several quantum resources in presence of TF, namely the (disconnected) entanglement entropy and the non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy. We will show that, compared to their non-frustrated counterparts, TF adds a distinct contribution to these resources, due to a stable, delocalized, topological excitation.

            <p>Decoy-state QKD with phase-randomized weak coherent pulses is typically analyzed assuming independent, precisely prepared intensities. Real sources, however, can exhibit correlated intensity drift across rounds, potentially leaking intensity information and breaking the standard decoy-state reduction to linear programs. Cauchy--Schwarz (CS) constraints can restore security by coupling $n$-photon yields across intensities, but they introduce nonlinear square-root constraints that are commonly handled via outer linearisation around channel-model-based reference points. We propose a reproducible alternative: first solve the full CS-constrained parameter-estimation problems using the interior-point nonlinear solver IPOPT, then use the resulting candidate solution as the linearisation point for the outer optimisation that certifies a valid lower bound on the asymptotic key rate. Simulations for both coarse-grained model-independent correlations and fine-grained truncated-Gaussian models show consistently tighter key-rate bounds than canonical reference points, and in some cases allow certifying optimality when both optimisation stages coincide.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Key Distribution with Imperfections: Recent Advances in Security Proofs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Andriolo, Esteban Vasques, Elizabeth Agudelo, Max Riegler, Matej Pivoluska, Gláucia Murta</p>
            <p>In contrast to classical cryptography, where the security of encoded messages typically relies on the inability of standard algorithms to overcome computational complexity assumptions, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can enable two spatially separated parties to establish an information-theoretically secure encryption, provided that the QKD protocol is underpinned by a security proof. In the last decades, security proofs robust against a wide range of eavesdropping strategies have established the theoretical soundness of several QKD protocols. However, most proofs are based on idealized models of the physical systems involved in such protocols and often include assumptions that are not satisfied in practical implementations. This mismatch creates a gap between theoretical security guarantees and actual experimental realizations, making QKD protocols vulnerable to attacks. To ensure the security of real-world QKD systems, it is therefore essential to account for imperfections in security analyses. In this article, we present an overview of recent analytical and numerical developments in QKD security proofs, which provide a versatile approach for incorporating imperfections and re-establishing the security of quantum communication protocols under realistic conditions.</p>

            <h2>Learning fermionic linear optics with Heisenberg scaling and physical operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aria Christensen, Andrew Zhao</p>
            <p>We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \eta^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $\eta$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas C. Rubin, Guang Hao Low, A. Eugene DePrince III</p>
            <p>Hamiltonian representations based on the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy provide rigorous lower bounds on ground-state energies and facilitate the design of efficient classical and quantum simulation algorithms. This work presents a unified framework connecting SOS decompositions with variational two-particle reduced density matrix (v2RDM) theory. We demonstrate that the ``weighted'' SOS ansatz naturally recovers the dual of the v2RDM program, enabling the strict enforcement of symmetry constraints such as particle number and spin. We provide explicit SOS constructions for the Hubbard model and electronic structure Hamiltonians, ranging from spin-free approximations to full rank-2 expansions. We also highlight theoretical connections to block-invariant symmetry shifts. Numerical benchmarks on molecular systems and Iron-Sulfur clusters validate these near frustration-free representations, demonstrating their utility in improving spectral gap amplification and reducing block encoding costs in quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arunangshu Debnath, Shaul Mukamel</p>
            <p>Nonlinear spectroscopic techniques using entangled photon pairs provide an opportunity to exploit non-classical correlations encoded in two-photon wavefunctions to manipulate two-exciton wavefunctions. We propose an entangled photon pair-enhanced multidimensional spectroscopic technique which is sensitive to exciton-exciton interactions and correlations at the ultrafast timescale. Simulations for a dissipative photosynthetic aggregate reveal the superior ability of entangled photon pairs, compared to both transform-limited and frequency-chirped laser pulses, to manipulate excited-state absorption pathways. The corresponding spectral features in the two-dimensional spectrogram are interpreted in terms of one- and two-exciton resonances. The signal scales linearly with the incoming intensity of the photon sources. It is argued that classifying these resonances using entangled photon source at the perturbative limit allow for probing exciton correlations at the natural energy scale. These insights can be used to explore multi-exciton dynamics using multiphoton entanglement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsin Raza, John B. DeBrota, Ariel Shlosberg, Noah Lordi, Ivan H. Deutsch</p>
            <p>We quantify the quantum-to-classical transition of the single-mode Kerr nonlinear dynamics in the presence of loss. We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size. Our results broaden the usual understanding of quantum-to-classical transitions and demonstrate the potential for creating robust nonclassical resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing in the presence of loss.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology via alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihao Ma, Jiahao Huang, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>Quantum metrology harnesses quantum entanglement to improve measurement precision beyond standard quantum limit. Although nonlinear interaction is essential for generating entanglement, during signal accumulation, it becomes detrimental and therefore must be suppressed. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation (AIQM) scheme, designed to operate under a fixed nonlinear interaction. During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations. By selectively eliminating and utilizing nonlinear interactions via AIQM, our work enables high-precision and high-accuracy entanglement-enhanced sensing without the need for active control of the nonlinear interaction.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interfaces are pivotal for quantum computation and communication. While typically analyzed using single-mode or open-quantum-system approximations, these models often neglect multi-mode field states and light-matter entanglement, hindering exact protocol modeling. Here, we solve the full Hamiltonian dynamics of a solid-state spin-photon interface for three key protocols: the generation of photon-number superpositions, a controlled photon-photon gate, and the production of photonic cluster states. By deriving exact fidelities, we identify fundamental performance limits. Our results reveal that while realistic imperfections severely limit photon-photon gates, they only slightly affect linear photonic clusters and are nearly harmless for photon-number state superpositions.</p>

            <h2>Color Centers and Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: A New Platform for Quantum Optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie-Cheng Feng, Johannes Eberle, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Johannes Knörzer, Eugene Demler, Ataç İmamoğlu</p>
            <p>Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) confine mid-infrared light to deep-subwavelength scales and may offer a powerful route to strong light-matter interactions. Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis</p>
            <p>Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, the Purcell effect can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for microcavity OLEDs. The model is then applied to estimate device performance in the different coupling regimes to determine which one is the best.</p>

            <p>Mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) are critical components of the quantum error correction protocols expected to enable utility-scale quantum computing. MCMs can be modeled by quantum instruments (a type of quantum operation or process), which can be characterized self-consistently using gate set tomography. However, experimentally estimated quantum instruments are often hard to interpret or relate to device physics. We address this challenge by adapting the error generator formalism -- previously used to interpret noisy quantum gates by decomposing their error processes into physically meaningful sums of "elementary errors" -- to MCMs. We deploy our new analysis on a transmon qubit device to tease out and quantify error mechanisms including amplitude damping, readout error, and imperfect collapse. We examine in detail how the magnitudes of these errors vary with the readout pulse amplitude, recover the key features of dispersive readout predicted by theory, and show that these features can be modeled parsimoniously using a reduced model with just a few parameters.</p>

            <h2>Correlation-Enabled Beatings in Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sirui Chen, Dragomir Davidović</p>
            <p>Long-lived beatings in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) remain difficult to interpret within standard excitonic open-system models, which typically assume factorized initialization and predict rapid coherence decay. We show that persistent beatings can arise from a correlation-driven mechanism that requires both slow bath memory and ultrafast pulse sequences that propagate system-bath correlations across optical interactions. In this regime, the pulse sequence unitarily dresses the bath-memory contribution and activates nonsecular population-coherence transfer during field-free evolution, sustaining coherence signatures far beyond factorized or weak-memory descriptions. Rather than addressing what is oscillating (excitonic versus vibronic) or quantum-versus-classical semantics, this work reframes long-lived beatings as a protocol-level dynamical effect: correlation-mediated retrieval under ultrafast control.</p>

            <p>Traditional Bell state measurement (BSM) and product basis measurements (PBM) have been integral to nearly the entire development of quantum computing. Unlike the BSM and the PBM, a recently proposed two-qubit joint measurement called the elegant joint measurement (EJM) exhibits novel tetrahedral symmetry in its single-qubit reduced states. In [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401], a parameterized two-qubit iso-entangled basis was proposed, with concurrence between 1/2 and 1, perfectly spanning the original EJM and conventional BSM. We present a two-qubit symmetric joint measurement having concurrence from 0 to 1/2, which is complementary to [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401] and contains the PBM and the original EJM. We investigate the symmetry of the current structure and its application in triangular networks. The results indicate that the reduction vectors of the current basis states exhibit rotational symmetry, rather than the aforementioned mirror symmetry; moreover, the output probability distributions of three parties in the network explicitly demonstrate the expected permutation symmetry. Furthermore, we generalize the two-qubit symmetric joint measurement to the multiqubit systems with an even number of qubits.</p>

The effect of this map on a generic quantum resource is investigated by studying the role of the CPTP map on the three core ingredients of a resource theory, namely, the free states, the free operations and the resource quantifiers. We show several general statements can be made about these three components of a resource theory in the presence of noninertial motion.</p>

            <p>The adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-trotter variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for molecular ground state energy calculation, yet its practical scalability is hampered by redundant excitation operators and excessive measurement costs. To address these challenges, we propose Param-ADAPT-VQE, a novel improved algorithm that selects excitation operators based on a parameter-based criterion instead of the traditional gradient-based metric. This strategy effectively eludes redundant operators. We further develop a sub-Hamiltonian technique and integrate a hot-start VQE optimization strategy, achieving a significant reduction in measurement costs. Numerical experiments on typical molecular systems demonstrate that Param-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the original ADAPT-VQE in computational accuracy, ansatz size, and measurement costs. Furthermore, our scheme retains the fundamental framework of ADAPT-VQE and is thus fully compatible with its various modified versions, enabling further performance improvements in specific aspects. This work presents an efficient and scalable enhancement to ADAPT-VQE, mitigating the core obstacles that impede its practical implementation in the field of molecular quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rasmus Vesterager Gothelf, Lars Bojer Madsen, Christian Saugbjerg Lange</p>
            <p>In recent years, strong-field processes such as high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and above-threshold ionization driven by nonclassical states of light have become an increasingly popular field of study. The theoretical modeling of these processes often applies an approximate phase-space expansion of the nonclassical driving field in terms of coherent states, which has been shown to accurately predict the harmonic spectrum. However, its accuracy for the computation of quantum optical observables like the degree of squeezing and photon statistics has not been thoroughly considered. In this work, we introduce this approximative phase-space description and discuss its accuracy, and we find that it mischaracterizes the quantum optical properties of the driving laser by making it an incoherent mixture of classical states. We further show that this error in the driving field description maps onto the light emitted from HHG, as neither sub-Poissonian photon statistics nor quadrature squeezing below vacuum fluctuations can be captured by the approximative phase-space description. Lastly, to benchmark the approximative phase-space description, we consider the quantum HHG from a one-band model, which yields an exact analytical solution. Using the approximative phase-space representation with this specific model, we find a small quantitative error in the quadrature variance of the emitted field that scales with pulse duration and emitter density. Our results show that using this approximative phase-space description can mischaracterize quantum optical observables. Attributing physical meaning to such results should therefore be accompanied by a quantitative analysis of the error.</p>

            <p>We present a simple and robust design for a squeezing-enhanced Sagnac interferometer that employs the concept of SU(1,1) interference to significantly surpass the classical sensitivity limit (shot-noise limit - SNL) in rotational sensing. By strategically placing an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) inside the Sagnac loop, light is automatically squeezed in both forward and backward directions of the loop, which enhances the detectability of a small phase. For measuring the squeezed quadrature, we explore two approaches: Direct detection of the output intensity, which is simple, but requires a high-efficiency photo-detector; and parametric homodyne with an additional OPA, which accepts practical detectors with no efficiency limitation, but is technically more complex. Our analysis demonstrates super-classical sensitivity under most realistic conditions of loss and detector inefficiency, thereby leveraging the resources of squeezing and the principles of SU(1,1) interference, while maintaining compatibility with standard Sagnac configurations.</p>

            <p>A rotating surface can induce a frequency shift in incident light by changing its angular momentum, a phenomenon known as the rotational Doppler effect. This effect provides a means to estimate the angular velocity of the rotating surface. In this work, we develop a continuous-variable quantum protocol for estimating the angular velocity of a rotating surface via the rotational Doppler effect. Our approach exploits squeezed and displaced Laguerre-Gaussian modes as quantum resources, which interact with a rotating metallic disc with surface roughness. The frequency shift induced by the rotational Doppler effect is then measured using a homodyne detection scheme. By analyzing the Fisher information, we demonstrate that the proposed squeezing-enhanced protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling in the ideal noiseless regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of noise and consider different surface models to assess their impact on the protocol's performance. While Heisenberg scaling is degraded in the presence of noise, we show that optimizing the energy allocation ratio between displacement and squeezing of the probe ensures that the quantum strategy consistently outperforms its classical counterpart.</p>

We consider ensembles of initial system states including pure and mixed Haar-random states, ensembles with fixed average energy or fixed mixedness, and varying initial photon numbers in the environment. In all cases, we observe a positive correlation between the initial entanglement and the entropy growth, although the fractional contribution of the initial entanglement varies.

            <p>Dicke superradiance is a collective phenomenon where the emission from ensembles of quantum emitters is coherently enhanced beyond the sum of each emitter's independent emission. Here, we propose a platform that exploits the delocalised nature of a high-Q, non-local mode supported by a dielectric metasurface (a so-called bound-state-in-the-continuum or BIC) to induce superradiant behaviour within an extended two-dimensional array of distant quantum emitters. We show that these BIC-mediated emitter interactions can span several wavelengths, thus overcoming the traditional subwavelength separation between emitters required in free space. We further show that reaching the idealised Dicke limit is possible in this system, provided that the emitters are coupled to the BIC mode efficiently enough, as quantified through the $\beta$-factor. Moreover, we demonstrate its experimental viability by analysing its robustness to realistic experimental imperfections. This work puts forward optical metasurfaces supporting BICs as a physically viable platform for realising the upper limits of cooperative emission in physically extended quantum emitter arrays.</p>

This intense diagonal disorder suppresses resonant flip-flop exchange, effectively renormalizing the density of states available for spectral diffusion.

            <h2>Generalized quantum theory for accessing nonlinear systems: the case of Levinson-Smith equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijan Bagchi, Anindya Ghose-Choudhury</p>
            <p>Motivated by a recently developed generalized scheme of quantum mechanics, we touch upon connections with Levinson-Smith classes of nonlinear systems that contain as a particular case the Liénard family of differential equations. The latter, which has coefficients of odd and odd symmetry, admits a closed form solution when converted to the Abel form. Analysis of the governing condition shows that one of the nontrivial equilibrium points is stable in character. Other classes of differential equations that we encounter speak of solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions for a certain combination of underlying parameters, while, for a different set, relevance to position-dependent mass systems is shown. In addition, an interesting off-shoot of our results is the emergence of solitonic-like solutions from the condition of the level surface in the system.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying the Operational Cost of Multipartite Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francois Payn, Michele Minervini, Davide Girolami</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement determines the strength and range of interactions in many-body quantum systems. Yet, it is hard to evaluate it, due to the complex structures of quantum states. Here, we introduce a generic method to quantify the k <= N-partite entanglement of an N-particle system, by maximizing an arbitrary bipartite entanglement measure within subsystems of size up to k. The resulting classification of multipartite states captures their experimental cost: creating a k-partite entangled state requires at least k-1 two-particle entangling gates. Further, we analytically calculate the newly defined k-partite entanglement of formation, which generalizes an important bipartite entanglement measure, in several classes of states, including the W states of any dimension.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Boundary Time Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sukrut Mondkar, Priya Ghosh, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the existence of a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in a dissipative collective-spin model that exhibits the boundary time crystal (BTC) phase. We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols.</p>

            <h2>Requirements for Teleportation in an Intercity Quantum Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soubhadra Maiti, Guus Avis, Sounak Kar, Stephanie Wehner</p>
            <p>We investigate the hardware requirements for quantum teleportation in an intercity-scale network topology consisting of two metropolitan-scale networks connected via a long-distance backbone link. Specifically, we identify the minimal improvements required beyond the state-of-the-art to achieve an end-to-end expected teleportation fidelity of $2/3$, which represents the classical limit. To this end, we formulate the hardware requirements computation as optimisation problems, where the hardware parameters representing the underlying device capabilities serve as decision variables. Assuming a simplified noise model, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the teleportation fidelity and rate when the network is realised using heterogeneous quantum hardware, including a quantum repeater chain with a memory cut-off. Our derivations are based on events defined by the order statistics of link generation durations in both the metropolitan networks and the backbone, and the resulting expressions are validated through simulations on the NetSquid platform. The analytical expressions facilitate efficient exploration of the optimisation parameter space without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We then apply this framework to a representative realisation in which the metropolitan nodes are based on trapped-ion processors and the backbone is composed of ensemble-based quantum memories. Our results suggest that teleportation across metropolitan distances is already achievable with state-of-the-art hardware when the data qubit is prepared after end-to-end entanglement has already been established, whereas extending teleportation to intercity scales requires additional, though plausibly achievable, improvements in hardware performance.</p>

            <p>We introduce a propagation-based approach to thermal state simulation by adapting Pauli and Majorana propagation to imaginary-time evolution in the Schrödinger picture. Our key observation is that high-temperature states can be sparse in the Pauli or Majorana bases, approaching the identity at infinite temperature. By formulating imaginary-time evolution directly in these operator bases and evolving from the maximally mixed state, we access a continuum of temperatures where the state remains efficiently representable. We provide analytic guarantees for small-coefficient truncation and Pauli-weight (Majorana-length) truncation strategies by quantifying the error growth and the impact of backflow. Large-scale numerics on the 1D J1-J2 model (energies) and the triangular-lattice Hubbard model (static correlations) validate efficiency at high temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum fields from real-time ensemble dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Zhang</p>
            <p>Relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) is commonly formulated in terms of operators, asymptotic states, and covariant amplitudes, a perspective that tends to obscure the real-time origin of field dynamics and correlations. Here we formulate quantum fields in a real-time Schrödinger-picture framework, in which fields evolve as probability ensembles on the space of field configurations. Within this formulation, the wavefunctional $\Psi[\phi,t]$ encodes a first-order, causal ensemble dynamics on configuration space. Interactions appear as couplings between configuration-space directions, while propagators arise as derived correlation structures rather than as fundamental postulates. Entanglement, scattering amplitudes, and conformal field theory correlators emerge as distinct projections of the same underlying ensemble evolution, corresponding to equal-time, asymptotic, and symmetry-organized observables. Standard operator, diagrammatic, and path-integral formulations are recovered as computational representations of this single real-time dynamics. This organization makes explicit the distinction between fundamental dynamical structure and representational tools in QFT, and clarifies the scope within which ensemble-averaged correlators account for quantum fluctuations, while also delineating the level at which questions associated with individual realizations and randomness would arise beyond the correlator-based field-theoretic description.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Computing Framework for VLBI Data Correlation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Liu</p>
            <p>We present a quantum computing framework for VLBI data correlation. We point out that a classical baseband time series data of length $N$ can be embedded into a quantum superposition state using amplitude encoding with only $\log_2 N$ qubits. The basic VLBI correlation and fringe fitting operations, including fringe rotation, Fourier transform, delay compensation, and cross correlation, can be implemented via quantum algorithms with significantly reduced computational complexity. We construct a full quantum processing pipeline and validate its feasibility and accuracy through direct comparison with a classical VLBI pipeline. We recognize that amplitude encoding of large data volumes remains the primary bottleneck in quantum computing; however, the quantized nature of VLBI raw data helps reduce the state-preparation complexity. Our investigation demonstrates that quantum computation offers a promising paradigm for VLBI data correlation and is likely to play a role in future VLBI systems.</p>

            <p>UGA-SSMRPT2, the spin-free perturbative analogue of Mukerjee's State-Specific Multireference Coupled Cluster Theory (MkMRCC) is known to be successful for size-extensive and intruder-free construction of dissociation curves. This work demonstrates that UGA-SSMRPT2 is also an accurate and computationally inexpensive framework for computing excitation energies. The method achieves near-chemical accuracy for the vast majority of $\pi \to \pi^*$, $n \to \pi^*$, charge-transfer, valence-Rydberg and Rydberg excited states commonly used for benchmarking electronic structure theories for excited states. Our results demonstrate that UGA-SSMRPT2 excitation energies lie within 0.20 eV of EOM-CCSD and/or well-established theoretical best estimates often surpassing the popular MRPT2 approaches like NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MCQDPT while typically requiring smaller active spaces. Its state-specific formulation circumvents the well-known intruder-state problem and eliminates the need for empirical parameters such as IPEA shifts in CASPT2. This work proposes UGA-SSMRPT2 as a robust, and scalable approach for modeling challenging electronic excited states.</p>

The setup excites the sample with a laser and acquires a spectrum at each spatial coordinate in a raster scan pattern. A double-acquisition method is used to remove cosmic ray artifacts by comparing subsequent measurements at the same spatial coordinate. Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission. The system integrates Python-based hardware control for motorized stages, spectrometer acquisition, and post-processing, with a migration to a galvo-mirror scanning approach for using it along with a cryostat for low temperature measurements. Our results demonstrate spatially resolved PL maps and temperature-dependent spectra, highlighting the capability of the setup to efficiently benchmark SPE performance. We further went on to perform automation of other experiments such as a Non-Linear Interferometry setup for Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and a Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy using a common path birefringence Interferometer to obtain hyperspectral images of our samples.</p>

Moreover, the extrapolation of these series to $\hbar=0$ unveils the correspondence between the bifurcation energy of classical resonances and the energy of the series of quantum resonances in the semiclassical limit $\hbar\to0$. Additionally, in order to obtain analytical expressions for our results, a semiclassical theory is developed.</p>

            <h2>Real and momentum space analysis of topological phases in 2D d-wave altermagnets</h2>

            <p>Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a third fundamental branch of magnetism, combining the vanishing net magnetization of antiferromagnets with the high-momentum-dependent spin splitting of ferromagnets. This study provides a comprehensive real- and momentum-space analysis of topological phases in two-dimensional d-wave altermagnets. By employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian, we characterize the topological phase transition occurring at a critical intra-sublattice hopping strength ($t_a^C$). We examine the emergence of Dirac nodal points and the resulting Berry curvature singularities, supported by a visual analysis of pseudospin texture winding. Crucially, we analize spin splitting, effective altermagnetic strength, and investigate the transport implications of these phases, uncovering giant conductivity anisotropy and spin-dependent "steering" effects driven by group velocity distribution across the Fermi surface. Beyond bulk properties, we analyze the edge state topology in ribbon geometries through the lens of information-theoretic markers like fidelity-susceptibility and inverse participation ratio, offering an alternative to traditional Chern number calculations. Our results demonstrate that the hybridization of edge states in ultra-narrow nanoribbons opens a controllable energy gap, a feature we exploit to propose a novel topological altermagnetic field-effect transistor design where ballistic and spatially spin-polarized transport can be electrostatically gated. This work establishes a theoretical and information-theoretic framework for "edgetronics" in altermagnetic materials, paving the way for next-generation, high-speed spintronic and "spin-splitter" logic devices and architectures.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian rotation-time reversal (RT)-symmetric spin models possess two distinct phases, the unbroken phase in which the entire spectrum is real and the broken phase which contains complex eigenspectra, thereby indicating a transition point, referred to as an exceptional point. We report that the dynamical quantities, namely the short- and long-time average of the Loschmidt echo which is the overlap between the initial and the final states, and the corresponding rate function, can faithfully predict the exceptional point. In particular, when the initial state is prepared as the ground state in the unbroken phase of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the system is quenched to either the broken or unbroken phase, we analytically demonstrate that the rate function and the average Loschmidt echo can distinguish between the quench that occurred in the broken or the unbroken phase for the nearest-neighbor non-Hermitian $XY$ model with uniform and alternating magnetic fields, thereby indicating the exceptional point. Furthermore, we exhibit that such quantities are capable of identifying the exceptional point even in models like the non-Hermitian short- and long-range $XYZ$ model with magnetic field which can only be solved numerically, thereby establishing it as detection criteria for recognizing exceptional points.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keshav Das Agarwal, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian model exhibits counterintuitive phenomena that are not observed in the Hermitian counterparts. To probe the competition between non-Hermitian and Hermitian interacting components of the Hamiltonian, we focus on a system containing non-Hermitian $XY$ spin chain and Hermitian Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Aharony (KSEA) interactions along with the transverse magnetic field. We show that the non-Hermitian model can be an effective Hamiltonian of a Hermitian $XX$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ with KSEA interaction and a local magnetic field that interacts with local and nonlocal reservoirs. The analytical expression of the energy spectrum divides the system parameters into two regimes: in one region, the strength of Hermitian KSEA interactions dominates over the imaginary non-Hermiticity parameter, while in the other, the opposite is true. In the former situation, we demonstrate that the nearest-neighbor entanglement and its derivative can identify quantum critical lines with the variation of the magnetic field. In this domain, we determine a surface where the entanglement vanishes, similar to the factorization surface, known in the Hermitian case. On the other hand, when non-Hermiticity parameters dominate, we report the exceptional and critical points where the energy gap vanishes and illustrate that bipartite entanglement is capable of detecting these transitions as well. Going beyond this scenario, when the ground state evolves after a sudden quench with the transverse magnetic field, both the rate function and the fluctuation of bipartite entanglement quantified via its second moment can detect critical lines generated without quenching dynamics.</p>

            <p>Mathematical analysis of the spectral properties of the time evolution operator in quantum walks is essential for understanding key dynamical behaviors such as localization and long-term evolution. The inhomogeneous three-state case, in particular, poses substantial analytical challenges due to its higher internal degrees of freedom and the absence of translational invariance. We develop a general framework for the spectral analysis of three-state quantum walks on the one-dimensional lattice with arbitrary time evolution operators. Our approach is based on a transfer matrix formulation that reduces the infinite-dimensional eigenvalue problem to a tractable system of two-dimensional recursions, enabling exact characterization of eigenstates. This framework applies broadly to space-inhomogeneous models, including those with finite defects and two-phase structures. We rigorously derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of point spectrum, along with a complete description of the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenstates, which are known to underlie quantum localization phenomena. Furthermore, we give a complete spectral decomposition -- discrete spectrum, flat-band eigenvalues (of infinite multiplicity), and absolutely continuous spectrum -- with explicit characterization of each component. Using this method, we perform exact numerical analyses of the Fourier walk with spatial inhomogeneity, revealing the emergence of localization despite its delocalized nature in the homogeneous case. Our results provide mathematical tools and physical insights into the structure of quantum walks, offering a systematic path for identifying and characterizing localized quantum states in complex quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum Teleportation is a very useful scheme for transferring quantum information. Given that the quantum information is encoded in a state of a system of distinguishable particles, and given that the shared bi-partite entangled state is also that of a system of distinguishable particles, the $\textit{optimal teleportation fidelity}$ of the shared state is known to be $(F_{max}d+1)/(d+1)$ with $F_{max}$ being the `maximal singlet fraction' of the shared state. However, Parity Superselection Rule (PSSR) in Fermionic Quantum Theory (FQT) puts constraint on the allowed set of physical states and operations, and thereby, leads to a different notion of Quantum entanglement - locally accessible and locally inaccessible (topological correlation). In the present work, we derive an expression for the $\textit{optimal teleportation fidelity}$ of locally accessible entanglement preservation, given that the quantum information to be teleported is encoded in fermionic modes of dimension $2^N \times 2^N$ using $2^N \times 2^N$-dim shared fermionic resource between the sender and receiver. To get the optimal teleportation fidelity in FQT, we introduce PSSR restricted twirling operations and establish fermionic state-channel isomorphism. Remarkably, we notice that the structure of the canonical form of twirl invariant fermionic shared state differs from that of the $\textit{isotropic state}$ -- the corresponding canonical invariant form for teleportation in Standard Quantum Theory (SQT). In this context, we also introduce restricted Clifford twirling operation that constitute the Unitary 2-design in case of FQT for experimentally validating such optimal average fidelity. Finally, we discuss the preservation of locally inaccessible entanglement for a class of fermionic teleportation channel.</p>

Besides, we also investigate the dynamics of IP under two different kinds of composite noises. Our results also confirm that sudden change of IP occurs under such composite noises.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Guha Roy, Kevin Slagle</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating an MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competitive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.</p>

            <p>Randomised measurements can efficiently characterise many-body quantum states by learning the expectation values of observables with low Pauli weights. In this paper, we generalise the theoretical tools of classical shadow tomography to the temporal domain to explore multi-time phenomena. This enables us to efficiently learn the features of multi-time processes such as correlated error rates, multi-time non-Markovianity, and temporal entanglement. We test the efficacy of these tools on a noisy quantum processor to characterise its noise features. Implementing these tools requires mid-circuit instruments, typically slow or unavailable in current quantum hardware. We devise a protocol to achieve fast and reliable instruments such that these multi-time distributions can be learned to a high accuracy. This enables a compact matrix product operator representation of large processes allowing us to showcase a reconstructed 20-step process (whose naive dimensionality is that of a 42-qubit state). Our techniques are pertinent to generic quantum stochastic dynamical processes, with a scope ranging across condensed matter physics, quantum biology, and in-depth diagnostics of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the representation theory of the algebra of partially transposed permutation operators, $\mathcal{A}^d_{p,p}$, which provides a matrix representation for the abstract walled Brauer algebra. This algebra has recently gained significant attention due to its relevance in quantum information theory, particularly in the efficient quantum circuit implementation of the mixed Schur-Weyl transform. In contrast to previous Gelfand-Tsetlin type approaches, our main technical contribution is the explicit construction of irreducible matrix units in the second-highest ideal that are group-adapted to the action of $\mathbb{C}[S_p]\times \mathbb{C}[S_p]$ subalgebra, where $S_p$ is the symmetric group. This approach suggests a recursive method for constructing irreducible matrix units in the remaining ideals of the algebra. The framework is general and applies to systems with arbitrary numbers of components and local dimensions. In addition, we present a complementary construction method based on tensor networks of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the unitary group. This approach enables the construction of all group-adapted irreducible matrix units, but requires knowledge of certain Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. This method can be successfully applied for a reasonably small number of particles with the support of dedicated software. The obtained results are applied to a special class of operators motivated by the mathematical formalism appearing in all variants of the port-based teleportation protocols through the mixed Schur-Weyl duality. We demonstrate that the given irreducible matrix units are, in fact, eigenoperators for the considered class.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a prominent model of strongly interacting fermions that serves as a toy model of quantum gravity and black hole physics. In this work, we study the Trotter error and gate complexity of the quantum simulation of the SYK model using Lie--Trotter--Suzuki formulas. Building on recent results by Chen and Brandão (arXiv:2111.05324), we derive bounds on the first- and higher-order Trotter error of the SYK model, and subsequently find near-optimal gate complexities for simulating these models. For the $k$-local SYK model on $n$ Majorana fermions, at time $t$, our gate complexity estimates for the first-order Lie--Trotter--Suzuki formula scales with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+\frac{5}{2}}t^2)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+3}t^2)$ for odd $k$, and the gate complexity of simulations using higher-order formulas scales with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+\frac{1}{2}}t)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+1}t)$ for odd $k$. Given that the SYK model has $\Theta(n^k)$ terms, these estimates are close to optimal. These gate complexities can be further improved upon in the context of simulating the time evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$, leading to a $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$-reduction in gate complexity for first-order and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$-reduction for higher-order formulas. Regarding the sparse SYK model, which is a simplified variant of the SYK model obtained by deleting all but a $\Theta(n)$ fraction of the terms in a uniformly i.i.d. manner, our average gate complexity estimates for higher-order formulas scale as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1+\frac{1}{2}} t)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{2} t)$ for odd $k$. Similar to the full SYK model, we obtain a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$-reduction simulating the time evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase classification via partial tomography-based quantum hypothesis testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akira Tanji, Hiroshi Yano, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Quantum phase classification is a fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics, traditionally approached using order parameters or quantum machine learning techniques such as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs). However, these methods often require extensive prior knowledge of the system or large numbers of quantum state copies for reliable classification. In this work, we propose a classification algorithm based on the quantum Neyman-Pearson test, which is theoretically optimal for distinguishing between two quantum states. While directly constructing the optimal test for many-body systems via full state tomography is intractable due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, we introduce a partitioning strategy that applies hypothesis tests to subsystems rather than the entire state, effectively reducing the required number of quantum state copies while maintaining classification accuracy. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating its advantages over conventional methods, including the order parameter-based classifier, the QCNN, and the recently developed classical machine learning algorithm enhanced with quantum data. Our results show that the proposed method achieves lower classification error probabilities with fewer required quantum state copies compared to all of these baselines, while also reducing the training cost relative to the QCNN and the classical machine learning algorithm enhanced with quantum data, and further decreasing the classical computational time in comparison with the latter. We additionally demonstrate scalability of our method in numerical experiments up to systems with 81 qubits. These findings highlight the potential of quantum hypothesis testing as a powerful tool for quantum phase classification, particularly in experimental settings where quantum measurements are combined with classical post-processing.</p>

            <h2>Theory of quasiparticle generation by microwave drives in superconducting qubits</h2>

            <p>Microwave drives play a central role in the control of superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit gates, readout, and parametric interactions. As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multiphoton pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles (QPs) and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multiphoton-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by charge- or flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that photon-assisted QP generation may affect novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate a two-particle collective measurement proposed as the optimal solution to a quantum state estimation game. Our results suggest that, in practice, the collective measurement strategy is at least as good as the best local approach, and it achieves a higher average fidelity when accounting for systematic errors. This photonic implementation uses a recently developed universal two-photon projective measurement based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, polarization-dependent loss, and unitary operations. We compare the performance to the case where the entangling component of the measurement is suppressed. We further apply the collective measurement to quantum state tomography, observing a near-optimal scaling of the infidelity with the total number of samples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu Dian, Fulin Zhang, Jingling Chen</p>
            <p>We propose a teleportation protocol that enables perfect transmission of a qubit using a partially entangled two-qutrit quantum channel. Within our scheme, we analyze the relationship among the three key ingredients of teleportation: (i) the quantum channel, (ii) the sender's (Alice's) measurement operations, and (iii) the classical information transmitted to the receiver (Bob). Compared to Gour's protocol \cite{PRA2004}, our scheme requires less entanglement of Alice's measurement and fewer classical bits sent to this http URL results also show a trade-off between these two resources and derive a lower bound for their sum, quantifying their interplay in the teleportation process.</p>

            <h2>Matrix-product entanglement characterizing the optimality of state-preparation quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Qi, Wen-Jun Li, Gang Su, Shi-Ju Ran</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement offers a powerful framework for understanding the complex collective phenomena in quantum many-body systems that are often beyond the description of conventional bipartite entanglement measures. Here, we propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs with specified virtual bond dimensions $\chi$, and thus are dubbed as $\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\chi$-MPE with respect to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing $\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing $\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\mathcal{H}_{\chi} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{D}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs and $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$-layer circuits. We provide an exact proof that $\mathcal{H}_{\chi=2} \equiv \mathcal{H}_{D=1}$. Our results establish tensor networks as a powerful and general tool for developing parametrized measures of multipartite entanglement. The matrix product form adopted in $\chi$-MPE can be readily extended to other tensor network ansätze, whose scaling behaviors are expected to assess the optimality of quantum circuit in preparing the corresponding tensor network states.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Decoding Problem : Tight Achievability Bounds and Application to Regev's Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agathe Blanvillain, André Chailloux, Jean-Pierre Tillich</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum decoding problem. It consists in recovering a codeword given a superposition of noisy versions of this codeword. By measuring the superposition, we get back to the classical decoding problem. It appears for the first time in Chen, Liu and Zhandry's work showing a quantum advantage for the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem for the $l_\infty$ norm. In a recent paper, Chailloux and Tillich proved that when we have a noise following a Bernoulli distribution, the quantum decoding problem can be solved in polynomial time and is therefore easier than classical decoding for which the best known algorithms have an exponential complexity. They also give an information theoretic limit for the code rate at which this problem can be solved which turns out to be above the Shannon limit. In this paper, we generalize the last result to all memoryless noise models. We also show similar results in the rank metric case which corresponds to a noise model which is not memoryless. We analyze the Pretty Good Measurement, from which we derive an information theoretic limit for this problem. By using the algorithm for the quantum decoding problem together with Regev's reduction, we derive a quantum algorithm sampling codewords from the dual code according to a probability distribution which is the dual of the original noise. It turns out that at the information theoretic limit, we get the most likely nonzero codeword of the dual code. When the distribution is a decreasing function of the weight, we find minimal nonzero codewords. Note that Regev's reduction used together with classical decoding is much less satisfying since it is not able to output those minimum weight codewords.</p>

            <h2>The Constant Geometric Speed Schedule for Adiabatic State Preparation: Towards Quadratic Speedup without Prior Spectral Knowledge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mancheon Han, Hyowon Park, Sangkook Choi</p>
            <p>The efficiency of adiabatic quantum evolution is governed by the evolution time $T$, which typically scales as $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{-2})$ with the minimum energy gap $\Delta$. However, the rigorous lower bound is $\mathcal{O}(L\Delta^{-1})$, where $L$ is the adiabatic path length. Although $L$ is formally upper-bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{-1})$, such a bound is often too loose in practice, and $L$ can be bounded independently of $\Delta$. This indicates the potential for a quadratic speedup through adiabatic schedule construction. Here, we introduce the constant geometric speed (CGS) schedule, which traverses the adiabatic path at a uniform rate. We show that this approach reduces the scaling of the evolution time by a factor of $\Delta^{-1}$, provided $L$ remains bounded independently of $\Delta$. We propose a segmented CGS protocol where path segment lengths are computed from eigenstate overlaps on the fly, eliminating the need for prior spectral knowledge. Numerical tests on adiabatic unstructured search, N$_2$, and a [2Fe-2S] cluster demonstrate the optimal $\Delta^{-1}$ scaling, confirming a quadratic speedup over the standard linear schedule.</p>

            <h2>Resilience of Entanglement-Induced Coordination in Adversarial Environments: The Team-Based Quantum Sabotage Game</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sinan Bugu</p>
            <p>Quantumgametheoryextendsclassical strategic decision-making by incorporating quantum superposition, entanglement, and measurement-induced randomness into competitive interactions. This paper introduces a team-based Quantum Sabotage Game (QSG), in which classical and quantum-enhanced teams engage in adversarial decision-making under identical information constraints. Unlike baseline classical teams, whose members act independently, quantum teams employ entanglement-assisted coor dination, generating structured correlations among decentralized actions without classical communication. We develop a formal quantum game-theoretic framework and analyze multi-agent strategies using Bell and Wentangled states, benchmarked against size-equivalent classical teams. Using numerical simulations, we compare outcome distributions, correlation structure, and robustness under ideal conditions, standard quantum noise models, and a device-inspired, reproducible hardware-like noise model via the Qiskit Aer FakeKyiv backend. While the symmetric payoff structure precludes any asymptotic increase in expected utility, multipartite entanglement, particularly W-state correlations, reshapes the finite-run joint-action distribution, producing nonclassical coordination patterns rather than an expectation-value advantage. These patterns persist under realistic noise, demonstrating that the resulting correlation signatures remain observable and differ from those produced by independent classical sampling. These results clarify the operational role of entanglement in adversarial environments, distinguishing correlation-based coordination from expectation-value advantage, and establish the Quantum Sabotage Game as a testbed for studying noise-resilient multi-agent quantum decision-making.</p>
