            <h2>Quantum-controlled synthetic materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei Vrajitoarea, Gabrielle Roberts, Kaden R. A. Hazzard, Jonathan Simon, David I. Schuster</p>
            <p>Analog quantum simulators and digital quantum computers are two distinct paradigms driving near-term applications in modern quantum science, from probing many-body phenomena to identifying computational advantage over classical systems. A transformative opportunity on the horizon is merging the high-fidelity many-body evolution in analog simulators with the robust control and measurement of digital machines. Such a hybrid platform would unlock new capabilities in state preparation, characterization and dynamical control. Here, we embed digital quantum control in the analog evolution of a synthetic quantum material by entangling the lattice potential landscape of a Bose-Hubbard circuit with an ancilla qubit. This Hamiltonian-level control induces dynamics under a superposition of different lattice configurations and guides the many-body system to novel strongly-correlated states where different phases of matter coexist -- ordering photons into superpositions of solid and fluid eigenstates. Leveraging hybrid control modalities, we adiabatically introduce disorder to localize the photons into an entangled cat state and enhance its coherence using a many-body echo technique. This work illustrates the potential for entangling quantum computers with quantum matter -- synthetic and solid-state -- for advantage in sensing and materials characterization.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation of the Dicke model in a two-dimensional ion crystal: chaos, quantum thermalization, and revivals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bryce Bullock, Sean R. Muleady, Jennifer F. Lilieholm, Yicheng Zhang, Robert J. Lewis-Swan, John J. Bollinger, Ana Maria Rey, Allison L. Carter</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body systems driven far from equilibrium can exhibit chaos, entanglement, and non-classical correlations, yet directly observing these phenomena in large, closed quantum systems remains challenging. Here we realize the Dicke model -- a fundamental description of light-matter interactions -- in a two-dimensional crystal of approximately 100 trapped ions. The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body Rényi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals. Our results establish large ion crystals as scalable analog quantum simulators of non-equilibrium light-matter dynamics and provide a controlled platform for experimental studies of information scrambling and entanglement in closed many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>U(1) lattice gauge theory and string roughening on a triangular Rydberg array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lisa Bombieri, Torsten V. Zache, Hannes Pichler, Daniel González-Cuadra</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Coherent Spin-Photon Interface of single PL6 Color Centers in Silicon Carbide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Xuan He, Gergő Thiering, Rui-Jian Liang, Ji-Yang Zhou, Shuo Ren, Wu-Xi Lin, Zhi-He Hao, Qi-Cheng Hu, Jun-Feng Wang, Adam Gali, Jin-Shi Xu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>The PL6 color center in silicon carbide has recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing, yet its coherent spin--photon interface has remained largely unexplored. Here we present a comprehensive investigation of single PL6 centers, combining spectroscopy with theoretical analysis. The excited-state fine structure is fully resolved using group-theoretical modeling and strain-dependent measurements. Under resonant excitation, we achieve a spin initialization fidelity of $99.69 \pm 0.03\%$ and a readout contrast of $98.31 \pm 1.03\%$. The spin--photon--entangled $A_2$ transition exhibits narrow optical linewidths ($\sim 180$~MHz) and a polarization visibility of $\sim 82\%$. Coherent optical driving enables Rabi frequencies up to $2.895$~GHz, while dynamical decoupling extends the spin coherence time from $0.5$~ms to $5.70$~ms. Our results establish PL6 as a competitive solid-state spin--photon interface hosted in a commercially available semiconductor platform.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Quantum and Semi-Classical Thermodynamics in Cavity QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcelo Janovitch, Sander Stammbach, Matteo Brunelli, Patrick P. Potts</p>
            <p>In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), photons leaving the cavity can be irreversibly lost or reused as a power source. This dichotomy is reflected in two different thermodynamic bookkeepings of the light field, both corresponding to valid thermodynamic frameworks. In this work, we formulate a rigorous semi-classical limit of cavity QED and show that the resulting thermodynamic description may qualitatively differ from that of the fully quantised model. We find that violations of the thermodynamic uncertainty relations are recovered in the semi-classical limit only by one of the two thermodynamic frameworks: the one which treats part of the photon flux as a power source. We illustrate our findings in a three-level system coupled to a driven cavity.</p>

            <h2>Extensible universal photonic quantum computing with nonlinearity</h2>

Lopena, Zi-Cheng Zhang, Guang Yang, Runxia Tao, Mingti Zhou, Gerard J. Machado, Ying Dong, Roberto Bondesan, Vlatko Vedral, M. S. Kim, Ian A. Walmsley, Raj B. Patel</p>
            <p>Universal quantum computing requires an architecture that supports both linear circuits and, crucially, strong nonlinear resources. For quantum photonic systems, integrating such nonlinearities with scalable linear circuitry has been a major bottleneck, leaving most optical experiments without nonlinear operations and, consequently, incapable of achieving universality. Here, we report an extensible photonic computer that supports a universal gate set by seamlessly combining fully programmable, scalable linear optical networks with integrated nonlinear modules. This platform enables a broad range of quantum computing and simulation tasks. We demonstrate the quasi-deterministic generation of optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, which are essential resources for bosonic error correction, yet had previously been realized only probabilistically. Furthermore, we simulate complex many-body quantum dynamics, exemplified by the Bose-Hubbard model. Such quantum simulation tasks have long been considered beyond the reach of photonic hardware limited to linear operations. These capabilities, enabled by our extensible architecture, establish a viable route towards photonic quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Heralding efficiency and brightness optimization of a micro-ring resonator via tunable coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Moses, Marcus J. Clark, Alex S. Clark, Siddarth K. Joshi, Imad I. Frauque</p>
            <p>Efficient and bright single photon sources on photonic chips are key to scaling quantum technologies. Spontaneous four wave mixing in micro-ring resonators creates excellent narrowband and tunable photon sources. We experimentally demonstrate the optimization of heralding efficiency and brightness by tuning the coupling of the pump, signal and idler modes into the resonator whilst operating in a pulsed pump regime. We observe a maximum detected pair rate of over 93,000~coincidences per second in a moderately over-coupled regime, alongside a high intrinsic idler heralding efficiency of 97.87$\pm$8.97\% when operating close to maximal over-coupling. The measured dependence on coupling strength is in strong agreement with theoretical predictions, experimentally validating the predicted trade-off between brightness and heralding efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Quantum noise in a squeezed-light-enhanced multiparameter quantum sensor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandra Sierant, Diana Méndez-Avalos, Santiago Tabares Giraldo, Morgan W. Mitchell</p>
            <p>We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid dc-rf optically pumped magnetometer (hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble, the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a nontrivial interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between $S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on readout quantum noise and measurement back-action. These results demonstrate quantum-enhanced sensitivity in a continuously operating multi-parameter sensor and reveal fundamental trade-offs between sensitivity, back-action, and bandwidth.</p>

            <p>In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $\pi$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli</p>
            <p>We introduce the Krylov distribution $\mathcal{D}(\xi)$, a static Krylov-space diagnostic that characterizes how inverse-energy response is organized in Hilbert space. The central object is the resolvent-dressed state $(H-\xi)^{-1}|\psi_0\rangle$, whose decomposition in the Krylov basis generated from a reference state defines a normalized distribution over Krylov levels. Unlike conventional spectral functions, which resolve response solely along the energy axis, the Krylov distribution captures how the resolvent explores the dynamically accessible subspace as the spectral parameter $\xi$ is varied. Using asymptotic analysis, exact results in solvable models, and numerical studies of an interacting spin chain, we identify three universal regimes: saturation outside the spectral support, extensive growth within continuous spectra, and sublinear or logarithmic scaling near spectral edges and quantum critical points. We further show that fidelity susceptibility and the quantum geometric tensor admit natural decompositions in terms of Krylov-resolved resolvent amplitudes.</p>

            <h2>Extracting Many-Body Quantum Resources within One-Body Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos L. Benavides-Riveros, Tomasz Wasak, Alessio Recati</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states. By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions. Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal 1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.</p>

            <h2>Theory of quantum error mitigation for non-Clifford gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Layden, Bradley Mitchell, Karthik Siva</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation techniques mimic noiseless quantum circuits by running several related noisy circuits and combining their outputs in particular ways. How well such techniques work is thought to depend strongly on how noisy the underlying gates are. Weakly-entangling gates, like $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ for small angles $\theta$, can be much less noisy than entangling Clifford gates, like CNOT and CZ, and they arise naturally in circuits used to simulate quantum dynamics. However, such weakly-entangling gates are non-Clifford, and are therefore incompatible with two of the most prominent error mitigation techniques to date: probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and the related form of zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). This paper generalizes these techniques to non-Clifford gates, and comprises two complementary parts. The first part shows how to effectively transform any given quantum channel into (almost) any desired channel, at the cost of a sampling overhead, by adding random Pauli gates and processing the measurement outcomes. This enables us to cancel or properly amplify noise in non-Clifford gates, provided we can first characterize such gates in detail. The second part therefore introduces techniques to do so for noisy $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates. These techniques are robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and exhibit concentration and sensitivity--crucial statistical properties for many experiments. They are related to randomized benchmarking, and may also be of interest beyond the context of error mitigation. We find that while non-Clifford gates can be less noisy than related Cliffords, their noise is fundamentally more complex, which can lead to surprising and sometimes unwanted effects in error mitigation. Whether this trade-off can be broadly advantageous remains to be seen.</p>

            <h2>Charge-$4e$ superconductor with parafermionic vortices: A path to universal topological quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyan Darius Shi, Zhaoyu Han, Srinivas Raghu, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $\nu=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.</p>

            <h2>Quasiperiodic dynamics in the nondipole x-ray strong field ionization in stabilization regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr V. Boitsov, Karen Z. Hatsagortsyan, Christoph H. Keitel</p>
            <p>Recent advances in strong x-ray laser techniques enable the study of nonlinear multiphoton ionization in extreme high-frequency fields. Although the stabilization regime in such fields is theoretically established, its modified properties in the nondipole regime for long laser pulses remains unknown. Here, we numerically investigate the strong-field ionization of an atom in a long XUV laser pulse in the nondipole regime. Our study of the time-dependent quantum dynamics reveals a quasiperiodic modulation of the ionization yield as a function of pulse duration. We demonstrate that the Coulomb-field-induced slow oscillation of the ionized electron wave packet during the interaction is responsible for the observed modulation of the ionization yield. Furthermore, we scrutinize the unusual photon momentum sharing between the photoelectron and the ion in this extreme regime. These effects are observable in upcoming x-ray free-electron laser facilities.</p>

            <h2>Disentanglement by means of action-induced representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gorka Muñoz-Gil, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Arunava Majumder, Paulin de Schoulepnikoff, Florian Fürrutter, Marius Krumm, Hans J. Briegel</p>
            <p>Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.</p>

            <h2>Second law of thermodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuya Chiba, Yasushi Yoneta, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Akira Shimizu</p>
            <p>The second law of thermodynamics for adiabatic operations -- constraints on state transitions in closed systems under external control -- is one of the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. On the other hand, it is recently established that even pure quantum states can represent thermal equilibrium. However, pure quantum states do not satisfy the second law in that they are not passive, i.e., work can be extracted from them if arbitrary unitary operations are allowed. It therefore remains unresolved how quantum mechanics can be reconciled with thermodynamics. Here, based on our key quantum-mechanical notions of thermal equilibrium and adiabatic operations, we address the emergence of the second law for adiabatic operations in the thermodynamics limit. We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results.</p>

            <h2>Biorthogonal scattering and generalized unitarity in non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jung-Wan Ryu, Henning Schomerus, Hee Chul Park</p>
            <p>We investigate the two-port scattering process in non-Hermitian dimer models via quantum measurements using external leads. We focus on two exemplary dimer models that preserve parity-time symmetry via spatial gain-loss balance and exhibit non-reciprocity due to directional hopping. The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate sawtooth wave adiabatic passage (SWAP) in a grating magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ transition of neutral $^{88}$Sr. From numerical simulations of SWAP using our laser beam geometry, we find that SWAP provides greater cooling than triangle wave frequency modulation despite the complex polarization environment of a grating MOT. The simulation is confirmed by our experimental results, where we demonstrate a factor of two improvement in transfer efficiency between our $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^1$P$_1$ grating MOT and our $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ grating MOT. We trap up to $3\times10^6$ $^{88}$Sr atoms in the $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ grating MOT, at an average temperature of 4.9 $\mu$K with a lifetime of approximately 0.7 s. Our results show that SWAP is effective in non-orthogonal laser beam geometries, allowing greater duty cycles or higher atom number in sensors based on narrow-line grating MOTs.</p>

Our equation of state links the cascade amplitude with the underlying scale-invariant energy flux, and can, for different drive strengths, gas densities, and interaction strengths, be recast into a universal power-law form using scalings consistent with the Gross-Pitaevskii model.</p>

            <h2>Deforming the Double-Scaled SYK & Reaching the Stretched Horizon From Finite Cutoff Holography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>We study the properties of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model under chord Hamiltonian deformations based on finite cutoff holography for general dilaton gravity theories with Dirichlet boundaries. The formalism immediately incorporates a lower-dimensional analog of $\text{T}\bar{\text{T}}(+\Lambda_2)$ deformations, denoted $T^2(+\Lambda_1)$, as special cases. In general, the deformation mixes the chord basis of the Hilbert space in the seed theory, which we order through a modification of the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting chord number in the ordered basis represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; the growth of complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. By performing a sequence of $T^2$ and $T^2+\Lambda_1$ deformations in the upper tail of the energy spectrum in the deformed DSSYK, we concretely realize the cosmological stretched horizon proposal in de Sitter holography by Susskind. We discuss other extensions with sine dilaton gravity, end-of-the-world branes, and the Almheiri-Goel-Hu model.</p>

            <h2>Private and interpretable clinical prediction with quantum-inspired tensor train models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Ramón Pareja Monturiol, Juliette Sinnott, Roger G. Melko, Mohammad Kohandel</p>
            <p>Machine learning in clinical settings must balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy. Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.</p>

            <p>Magnetometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been extensively studied for applications requiring diverse capabilities, spanning from nanometer spatial resolution to subpicotesla sensitivity. Among various applications, diamond magnetometers can demonstrate high sensitivity magnetic sensing within millimeter-scale size for endoscopic applications. However, the trade-off between sensitivity and spatial resolution of diamond magnetometry makes it difficult to achieve such a probe. In this study, we present a millimeter-scale rigid diamond magnetometer probe with enhanced sensitivity via optimizing the optical design. By coupling the frustum diamond with the miniaturized compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) lens, we enhance the fluorescence collection efficiency by 37% within 4 mm diameter, and the achieved sensitivity is 200 pT/Hz1/2 based on the sample with the resonance linewidth of ~8 MHz. With this verified structure, endoscopes with mm-size probe and picotesla sensitivity can be projected for surgical and industrial applications in the future.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry and localisation in causally constrained quantum operator dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcell D. Kovács, Christopher J. Turner, Lluís Masanes</p>
            <p>This paper explores the connection between causality and many-body dynamics by studying the algebraic structure of tri-partite unitaries ('walls') which permanently arrest local operator spreading in their time-periodic evolution. We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor. Our results offer a rigorous understanding of locally constrained quantum dynamics from a quantum information perspective.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Sieve Tracer: A Hybrid Framework for Layer-Wise Activation Tracing in Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Pan</p>
            <p>Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer the internal computations of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet separating sparse semantic signals from high-dimensional polysemantic noise remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Quantum Sieve Tracer, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to characterize factual recall circuits. We implement a modular pipeline that first localizes critical layers using classical causal tracing, then maps specific attention head activations into an exponentially large quantum Hilbert space. Using open-weight models (Meta Llama-3.2-1B and Alibaba Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct), we perform a two-stage analysis that reveals a fundamental architectural divergence. While Qwen's layer 7 circuit functions as a classic Recall Hub, we discover that Llama's layer 9 acts as an Interference Suppression circuit, where ablating the identified heads paradoxically improves factual recall. Our results demonstrate that quantum kernels can distinguish between these constructive (recall) and reductive (suppression) mechanisms, offering a high-resolution tool for analyzing the fine-grained topology of attention.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Mahdi Chehimi, Felix Burt, Kin K. Leung</p>
            <p>The realization of distributed quantum neural networks (DQNNs) over quantum internet infrastructures faces fundamental challenges arising from the fragile nature of entanglement and the demanding synchronization requirements of distributed learning. We introduce a Consensus-Entanglement-Aware Scheduling (CEAS) framework that co-designs quantum consensus protocols with adaptive entanglement management to enable robust synchronous training across distributed quantum processors. CEAS integrates fidelity-weighted aggregation, in which parameter updates are weighted by quantum Fisher information to suppress noisy contributions, with decoherence-aware entanglement scheduling that treats Bell pairs as perishable resources subject to exponential decay. The framework incorporates quantum-authenticated Byzantine fault tolerance, ensuring security against malicious nodes while maintaining compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) constraints. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees under heterogeneous noise conditions, while numerical simulations demonstrate that CEAS maintains 10-15 percentage points higher accuracy compared to entanglement-oblivious baselines under coordinated Byzantine attacks, achieving 90 percent Bell-pair utilization despite coherence time limitations. This work provides a foundational architecture for scalable distributed quantum machine learning, bridging quantum networking, distributed optimization, and early fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>To reduce circuit depth when executing Quantum algorithms, it is necessary to maximize qubit connectivity on a near-term quantum processor. While addressing this, we also need to ensure high gate fidelity, suppression of unwanted ZZ cross-talk, a compact layout footprint, and minimal control hardware complexity to support scalability. In current superconducting quantum chips, fixed coupling is used as it is easier to scale, but it is limited by unwanted static ZZ interaction during single qubit operations, which degrades system performance. To overcome these challenges, we have introduced a first-of-its-kind hybrid tunable-coupling architecture that connects four fixed-frequency transmon qubits using a single coupler. This hybrid coupler uses off-resonant Stark drives to tune ZZ strength between qubit pairs. Experimentally backed simulation results indicate that our proposed hybrid design maximizes the qubit connectivity while reducing control overhead. This design achieves a near 20% reduction in circuit depth compared to IBM's Heavy-Hexagonal layout, showing its potential for scalability.</p>

            <p>We report a normal-mode induced synchronization blockade in coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators under the influence of external drive. In this mechanism, the coupling hybridizes the oscillator modes into spectrally split normal modes. The destructive interference between the transitions to these modes blocks synchronization. We find that this blockade can be controlled simply by tuning the coupling strength and detuning allowing dynamic manipulation of quantum synchronization through collective mode dynamics. We analyze the phase-locking behaviour using perturbation analysis. Further, by deriving steady-state probability amplitudes we show how the energy redistribution and spectral splitting forms the basis of the blockade. Our results might provide new insights into how synchronization can be controlled in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Robust quantum transmission is driving a new paradigm in space-ground quantum networking. Although phase encoding has been widely adopted in terrestrial fiber channels, it has long been considered unsuitable for free-space quantum communication. Here, we demonstrate phase-encoded quantum communication over 1400 m of urban free space. The system maintained stable operation for nearly one hour, achieving 99.07% interference visibility and an average quantum bit error rate of 2.38%. The free-space quantum states were directly coupled into the fiber and transmitted over an additional 10 km, confirming seamless interoperability across different media. We further show that turbulence-induced phase drifts between successive picosecond pulses can be effectively compensated. A cascaded-link model and numerical simulations indicate feasibility over free-space distances exceeding 30 km, underscoring the potential for satellite-to-ground quantum links. This work establishes the viability of phase encoding in free-space quantum networks, simplifying cross-medium integration and enabling compatibility with existing classical infrastructures.</p>

The resulting constraints have the form of a semidefinite program, which allows us to efficiently bound the values a given expectation value can take in the steady state. Our results show fast convergence of the bounds with the size of the reduced density matrices, giving very competitive predictions for the steady state of several one- and two-dimensional models for an arbitrary number of particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Waqas Haseeb, Mohamad Toutounji</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of ligand--receptor electron transfer and conformational response in a prototypical viral binding complex, using the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein bound to the human ACE2 receptor as a model system. Treating the ACE2--Spike interface as an open quantum system embedded in a biological environment, we simulate how vibrational interactions and environmental memory reshape the coupled receptor--ligand dynamics and modulate vibrationally assisted electron transfer (VA-ET). Using a Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr"odinger Equation (NMSSE) approach, we simulate electron transfer between donor and acceptor states in ACE2 modulated by a specific vibrational mode of the Spike protein. The influence of environmental memory (non-Markovian dynamics) and non-Condon effects (vibrational modulation of electronic coupling) are analyzed in detail. In the Markovian limit with an Ohmic bath, population dynamics reduce to exponential kinetics, and extracted transfer rates agree with semiclassical Marcus--Jortner predictions in the appropriate regime. Beyond the Markovian, high-temperature limit, we observe clear deviations: non-exponential decay, coherent oscillatory features, and enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational frequency. Incorporating off-diagonal system--bath coupling alongside diagonal coupling shows that nuclear motion can dynamically gate electron tunneling, sharpening the frequency selectivity of the VA-ET mechanism. Finally, a structured (sub-Ohmic) environmental spectral density with long-lived correlations (``memory'') preserves electronic--vibrational coherence over longer times, amplifying vibrational selectivity under non-Condon coupling. Our results support the proposition that ACE2--Spike binding may exploit vibrational assistance and quantum coherence as a molecular recognition mechanism.</p>

The resulting states exhibit optimal quantum Fisher information, making them ideal for surpassing the classical limit of phase sensitivity in quantum metrology applications. Notably, our protocol is compatible with a time-reversal strategy for quantum metrology, ensuring its practical viability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Heisenberg limit scaling remains intact even when reducing the twisting employed in tandem with the number of atoms, thereby mitigating realistic losses such as photon scattering.</p>

Such errors can be problematic for quantum error correction (QEC) codes, which are generally designed to correct independent errors. To address this, we have developed a computational model to simulate the effects of radiation impacts on QEC performance. This is achieved by building from recently developed models of quasiparticle density, mapping radiation-induced qubit error rates onto a quantum error channel and simulation of a simple surface code. We also provide a performance metric to quantify the resilience of a QEC code to radiation impacts. Additionally, we sweep various parameters of chip design to test mitigation strategies for improved QEC performance. Our model approach is holistic, allowing for modular performance testing of error mitigation strategies and chip and code designs.</p>

            <p>We present a hybrid classical-quantum image preparation scheme that reduces the quantum implementation cost of image loading for quantum pixel information encoding (QPIE). The proposed method, termed JPEG-assisted QPIE (JQPIE), loads only the quantized JPEG coefficients into a quantum register, leading to substantial reductions in \texttt{CX} gate count and circuit depth while preserving reconstruction quality comparable to classical JPEG compression. We develop two variants of the hybrid strategy. The first realizes the complete JPEG decompression pipeline coherently by implementing inverse quantization via a block-encoded unitary operator. The second, referred to as \emph{quantization-free JQPIE} (QF-JQPIE), omits quantization altogether, thereby avoiding the probabilistic nature of block-encoded quantization. Numerical simulations on standard benchmark image datasets (USC--SIPI and Kodak) demonstrate that both variants achieve significant constant-factor reductions in \texttt{CX} gate count and circuit depth relative to direct QPIE loading, while maintaining high reconstruction quality as measured by PSNR and SSIM.</p>

We benchmark the measured output biases against ideal predictions and discuss the impact of device noise.

            <p>Quantum computing offers an alternative paradigm for addressing combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical computing. Despite recent hardware improvements, the execution of empirical quantum optimization experiments at scales known to be hard for state-of-the-art classical solvers is not yet in reach. In this work, we offer a different way to approach combinatorial optimization with near-term quantum computing. Motivated by the promising results observed in using quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) for approximating complicated probability distributions, we combine ideas of sampling from the device with QeMCMC together with warm-starting and parallel tempering, in the context of combinatorial optimization. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm recovers the global optima for instances of the Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS) up to 117 decision variables using 117 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We show early evidence of a scaling advantage of our algorithm compared to similar classical methods for the chosen instances of MIS. MIS is practically relevant across domains like financial services and molecular biology, and, in some cases, already difficult to solve to optimality classically with only a few hundred decision variables.</p>

            <p>The N-representability problem for reduced density matrices remains a fundamental challenge in electronic structure theory. Following our previous work that employs a unitary-evolution algorithm based on an adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter variational quantum algorithm to probe pure-state N-representability of reduced density matrices [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9968], in this work we propose a practical framework for determining the ensemble N-representability of a p-body matrix. This is accomplished using a purification strategy consisting of embedding an ensemble state into a pure state defined on an extended Hilbert space, such that the reduced density matrices of the purified state reproduce those of the original ensemble. By iteratively applying variational unitaries to an initial purified state, the proposed algorithm minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between its p-body reduced density matrix and a specified target p-body matrix, which serves as a measure of the N-representability of the target. This methodology facilitates both error correction of defective ensemble reduced density matrices, and quantum-state reconstruction on a quantum computer, offering a route for density-matrix refinement. We validate the algorithm with numerical simulations on systems of two, three, and four electrons in both, simple models as well as molecular systems at finite temperature, demonstrating its robustness.</p>

Vandermonde matrices of the eigenvalues play a central role in the theory. This proposal directly finds the pseudo-distribution using weak measurements of the generator of position moments (momentum translations). While the pseudo-distribution can be extracted from the data in a theory-agnostic way, it is shown that under quantum-mechanical formalism, the predicted pseudo-distribution is identified with the Kirkwood-Dirac pseudo-distribution. We discuss the construction of both the joint pseudo-distribution and a conditional pseudo-distribution, which is closely connected to weak-value physics. By permuting position and momentum measurements, we give a prescription to directly probe the canonical commutation relation and verify it for any quantum state. This work establishes the theory of a characteristic function approach to pseudo-distributions, as well as providing a constructive approach to measuring them directly.</p>

            <p>Reliable preparation of many-body ground states is an essential task in quantum computing, with applications spanning areas from chemistry and materials modeling to quantum optimization and benchmarking. A variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, including variational methods. However, variational training often struggle to navigate complex energy landscapes, frequently encountering suboptimal local minima or suffering from barren plateaus. In this work, we introduce an iterative strategy for ground-state preparation based on a stepwise (discretized) Hamiltonian deformation. By complementing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with adiabatic principles, we demonstrate that solving a sequence of intermediate problems facilitates tracking the ground-state manifold toward the target system, even as we scale the system size. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving a lower bound on the loss variance that suggests trainability throughout the deformation, provided the system remains away from gap closings. Numerical simulations, including the effects of shot noise, confirm that this path-dependent tracking consistently converges to the target ground state.</p>

In this work, we reformulate the gravitationally mediated interaction phase in a conformally invariant twistor framework in which no notion of spacetime distance is assumed. We show that the bilocal phase responsible for entanglement generation remains well-defined and non-factorizable even in the absence of spacetime geometry. The familiar Newtonian $1/r$ phase, relevant for QGEM protocols, arises only after the conformal invariance is broken by introducing the infinity twistor, which selects a particular spacetime representation of the underlying bilocal quantum interaction. Our results isolate the genuinely quantum content of QGEM protocols and clarify the contingent role played by spacetime geometry in mediating entanglement.</p>

As a result, our tool scales to distance 17 for a physical error rate of 0.0005 with a two-hour time budget on a desktop. For this case, it estimated a logical error rate of $1.51 \times 10^{-11}$ with high confidence.</p>

            <h2>Agnostic Parameter Estimation with Large Spins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huining Zhang, X. X. Yi</p>
            <p>The quantum Fisher information of a quantum state with respect to a certain parameter quantifies the sensitivity of the quantum state to changes in that parameter. Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2. Considering large spin probes can achieve a larger quantum Fisher information, offering enhanced metrological advantage, we here utilize the entanglement between a large spin probe and an ancilla to achieve optimal quantum Fisher information for estimating the rotation angle, without prior knowledge of the rotation axis. Different from the previous spin-1/2 case, achieving the optimal precision with large spins generally requires post-selection, resulting in a success probability dependent on the dimension of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we extend the encoding state from the maximally entangled case to general entangled states, showing that optimal metrology can still be achieved with a certain success probability.</p>

Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$ and a known set of observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\{\mathrm{tr}(O_i\rho)\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $\epsilon$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $\rho$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $\epsilon$ is below an instance-dependent threshold. Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$, where $\Gamma_p$ is a function of $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i O_i$ with $\|\alpha\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $\Theta(\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_p/\epsilon^2)$. We then show $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_\infty = \Gamma_\infty$. In both cases, allowing $c$-copy measurements improves the sample complexity by at most $\Omega(1/c)$. Our results establish a quantitative correspondence between quantum learning and metrology, unifying asymptotic metrological limits with finite-sample learning guarantees.</p>

            <h2>Efficient time-evolution of matrix product states using average Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Belal Abouraya, Jirawat Saiphet, Fedor Jelezko, Ressa S. Said</p>
            <p>Simulating quantum many-body systems (QMBS) is one of the long-standing, highly non-trivial challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information due to the exponentially growing size of the system's Hilbert space. To date, tensor networks have been an essential tool for studying such quantum systems, owing to their ability to efficiently capture the entanglement properties of the systems they represent. One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes. Our work paves the way for efficient simulation of QMBS under the influence of time-dependent Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>Although in general boundary conditions do not affect the bulk properties of a system, some of them are special and defy such expectation. This is the case, for instance, of those inducing geometrical frustration in a classical magnet. Recently, the study of such settings in quantum systems (dubbed topological frustration) has uncovered peculiar features, interesting both from a fundamental and technological point of view. In this work, we present and discuss the behavior of several quantum resources in presence of TF, namely the (disconnected) entanglement entropy and the non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy. We will show that, compared to their non-frustrated counterparts, TF adds a distinct contribution to these resources, due to a stable, delocalized, topological excitation. Remarkably, this contribution can be calculated analytically, due to its similarities with that of a W-state.</p>

            <h2>Tighter Asymptotic Key Rates for Intensity-Correlated Decoy-State QKD via Nonlinear Programming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matej Pivoluska, Mateus Araújo</p>
            <p>Decoy-state QKD with phase-randomized weak coherent pulses is typically analyzed assuming independent, precisely prepared intensities. Real sources, however, can exhibit correlated intensity drift across rounds, potentially leaking intensity information and breaking the standard decoy-state reduction to linear programs. Cauchy--Schwarz (CS) constraints can restore security by coupling $n$-photon yields across intensities, but they introduce nonlinear square-root constraints that are commonly handled via outer linearisation around channel-model-based reference points. We propose a reproducible alternative: first solve the full CS-constrained parameter-estimation problems using the interior-point nonlinear solver IPOPT, then use the resulting candidate solution as the linearisation point for the outer optimisation that certifies a valid lower bound on the asymptotic key rate. Simulations for both coarse-grained model-independent correlations and fine-grained truncated-Gaussian models show consistently tighter key-rate bounds than canonical reference points, and in some cases allow certifying optimality when both optimisation stages coincide.</p>

            <p>In contrast to classical cryptography, where the security of encoded messages typically relies on the inability of standard algorithms to overcome computational complexity assumptions, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can enable two spatially separated parties to establish an information-theoretically secure encryption, provided that the QKD protocol is underpinned by a security proof. In the last decades, security proofs robust against a wide range of eavesdropping strategies have established the theoretical soundness of several QKD protocols. However, most proofs are based on idealized models of the physical systems involved in such protocols and often include assumptions that are not satisfied in practical implementations. This mismatch creates a gap between theoretical security guarantees and actual experimental realizations, making QKD protocols vulnerable to attacks. To ensure the security of real-world QKD systems, it is therefore essential to account for imperfections in security analyses. In this article, we present an overview of recent analytical and numerical developments in QKD security proofs, which provide a versatile approach for incorporating imperfections and re-establishing the security of quantum communication protocols under realistic conditions.</p>

            <h2>Learning fermionic linear optics with Heisenberg scaling and physical operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aria Christensen, Andrew Zhao</p>
            <p>We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \eta^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $\eta$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian representations based on the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy provide rigorous lower bounds on ground-state energies and facilitate the design of efficient classical and quantum simulation algorithms. This work presents a unified framework connecting SOS decompositions with variational two-particle reduced density matrix (v2RDM) theory. We demonstrate that the ``weighted'' SOS ansatz naturally recovers the dual of the v2RDM program, enabling the strict enforcement of symmetry constraints such as particle number and spin. We provide explicit SOS constructions for the Hubbard model and electronic structure Hamiltonians, ranging from spin-free approximations to full rank-2 expansions. We also highlight theoretical connections to block-invariant symmetry shifts. Numerical benchmarks on molecular systems and Iron-Sulfur clusters validate these near frustration-free representations, demonstrating their utility in improving spectral gap amplification and reducing block encoding costs in quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arunangshu Debnath, Shaul Mukamel</p>
            <p>Nonlinear spectroscopic techniques using entangled photon pairs provide an opportunity to exploit non-classical correlations encoded in two-photon wavefunctions to manipulate two-exciton wavefunctions. We propose an entangled photon pair-enhanced multidimensional spectroscopic technique which is sensitive to exciton-exciton interactions and correlations at the ultrafast timescale. Simulations for a dissipative photosynthetic aggregate reveal the superior ability of entangled photon pairs, compared to both transform-limited and frequency-chirped laser pulses, to manipulate excited-state absorption pathways. The corresponding spectral features in the two-dimensional spectrogram are interpreted in terms of one- and two-exciton resonances. The signal scales linearly with the incoming intensity of the photon sources. It is argued that classifying these resonances using entangled photon source at the perturbative limit allow for probing exciton correlations at the natural energy scale. These insights can be used to explore multi-exciton dynamics using multiphoton entanglement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsin Raza, John B. DeBrota, Ariel Shlosberg, Noah Lordi, Ivan H. Deutsch</p>
            <p>We quantify the quantum-to-classical transition of the single-mode Kerr nonlinear dynamics in the presence of loss. We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size. Our results broaden the usual understanding of quantum-to-classical transitions and demonstrate the potential for creating robust nonclassical resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing in the presence of loss.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihao Ma, Jiahao Huang, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>Quantum metrology harnesses quantum entanglement to improve measurement precision beyond standard quantum limit. Although nonlinear interaction is essential for generating entanglement, during signal accumulation, it becomes detrimental and therefore must be suppressed. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation (AIQM) scheme, designed to operate under a fixed nonlinear interaction. During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations. By selectively eliminating and utilizing nonlinear interactions via AIQM, our work enables high-precision and high-accuracy entanglement-enhanced sensing without the need for active control of the nonlinear interaction.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interfaces are pivotal for quantum computation and communication. While typically analyzed using single-mode or open-quantum-system approximations, these models often neglect multi-mode field states and light-matter entanglement, hindering exact protocol modeling.

By deriving exact fidelities, we identify fundamental performance limits. Our results reveal that while realistic imperfections severely limit photon-photon gates, they only slightly affect linear photonic clusters and are nearly harmless for photon-number state superpositions.</p>

            <p>Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) confine mid-infrared light to deep-subwavelength scales and may offer a powerful route to strong light-matter interactions. Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis</p>
            <p>Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, the Purcell effect can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for microcavity OLEDs. The model is then applied to estimate device performance in the different coupling regimes to determine which one is the best.</p>

            <p>Mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) are critical components of the quantum error correction protocols expected to enable utility-scale quantum computing. MCMs can be modeled by quantum instruments (a type of quantum operation or process), which can be characterized self-consistently using gate set tomography. However, experimentally estimated quantum instruments are often hard to interpret or relate to device physics. We address this challenge by adapting the error generator formalism -- previously used to interpret noisy quantum gates by decomposing their error processes into physically meaningful sums of "elementary errors" -- to MCMs. We deploy our new analysis on a transmon qubit device to tease out and quantify error mechanisms including amplitude damping, readout error, and imperfect collapse. We examine in detail how the magnitudes of these errors vary with the readout pulse amplitude, recover the key features of dispersive readout predicted by theory, and show that these features can be modeled parsimoniously using a reduced model with just a few parameters.</p>

            <p>Long-lived beatings in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) remain difficult to interpret within standard excitonic open-system models, which typically assume factorized initialization and predict rapid coherence decay. We show that persistent beatings can arise from a correlation-driven mechanism that requires both slow bath memory and ultrafast pulse sequences that propagate system-bath correlations across optical interactions. In this regime, the pulse sequence unitarily dresses the bath-memory contribution and activates nonsecular population-coherence transfer during field-free evolution, sustaining coherence signatures far beyond factorized or weak-memory descriptions. Rather than addressing what is oscillating (excitonic versus vibronic) or quantum-versus-classical semantics, this work reframes long-lived beatings as a protocol-level dynamical effect: correlation-mediated retrieval under ultrafast control.</p>

            <p>Traditional Bell state measurement (BSM) and product basis measurements (PBM) have been integral to nearly the entire development of quantum computing. Unlike the BSM and the PBM, a recently proposed two-qubit joint measurement called the elegant joint measurement (EJM) exhibits novel tetrahedral symmetry in its single-qubit reduced states. In [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401], a parameterized two-qubit iso-entangled basis was proposed, with concurrence between 1/2 and 1, perfectly spanning the original EJM and conventional BSM. We present a two-qubit symmetric joint measurement having concurrence from 0 to 1/2, which is complementary to [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401] and contains the PBM and the original EJM. We investigate the symmetry of the current structure and its application in triangular networks. The results indicate that the reduction vectors of the current basis states exhibit rotational symmetry, rather than the aforementioned mirror symmetry; moreover, the output probability distributions of three parties in the network explicitly demonstrate the expected permutation symmetry. Furthermore, we generalize the two-qubit symmetric joint measurement to the multiqubit systems with an even number of qubits.</p>

            <p>The adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-trotter variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for molecular ground state energy calculation, yet its practical scalability is hampered by redundant excitation operators and excessive measurement costs. To address these challenges, we propose Param-ADAPT-VQE, a novel improved algorithm that selects excitation operators based on a parameter-based criterion instead of the traditional gradient-based metric. This strategy effectively eludes redundant operators. We further develop a sub-Hamiltonian technique and integrate a hot-start VQE optimization strategy, achieving a significant reduction in measurement costs. Numerical experiments on typical molecular systems demonstrate that Param-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the original ADAPT-VQE in computational accuracy, ansatz size, and measurement costs. Furthermore, our scheme retains the fundamental framework of ADAPT-VQE and is thus fully compatible with its various modified versions, enabling further performance improvements in specific aspects. This work presents an efficient and scalable enhancement to ADAPT-VQE, mitigating the core obstacles that impede its practical implementation in the field of molecular quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rasmus Vesterager Gothelf, Lars Bojer Madsen, Christian Saugbjerg Lange</p>
            <p>In recent years, strong-field processes such as high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and above-threshold ionization driven by nonclassical states of light have become an increasingly popular field of study. The theoretical modeling of these processes often applies an approximate phase-space expansion of the nonclassical driving field in terms of coherent states, which has been shown to accurately predict the harmonic spectrum. However, its accuracy for the computation of quantum optical observables like the degree of squeezing and photon statistics has not been thoroughly considered. In this work, we introduce this approximative phase-space description and discuss its accuracy, and we find that it mischaracterizes the quantum optical properties of the driving laser by making it an incoherent mixture of classical states. We further show that this error in the driving field description maps onto the light emitted from HHG, as neither sub-Poissonian photon statistics nor quadrature squeezing below vacuum fluctuations can be captured by the approximative phase-space description. Lastly, to benchmark the approximative phase-space description, we consider the quantum HHG from a one-band model, which yields an exact analytical solution. Using the approximative phase-space representation with this specific model, we find a small quantitative error in the quadrature variance of the emitted field that scales with pulse duration and emitter density. Our results show that using this approximative phase-space description can mischaracterize quantum optical observables. Attributing physical meaning to such results should therefore be accompanied by a quantitative analysis of the error.</p>

            <p>We present a simple and robust design for a squeezing-enhanced Sagnac interferometer that employs the concept of SU(1,1) interference to significantly surpass the classical sensitivity limit (shot-noise limit - SNL) in rotational sensing. By strategically placing an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) inside the Sagnac loop, light is automatically squeezed in both forward and backward directions of the loop, which enhances the detectability of a small phase. For measuring the squeezed quadrature, we explore two approaches: Direct detection of the output intensity, which is simple, but requires a high-efficiency photo-detector; and parametric homodyne with an additional OPA, which accepts practical detectors with no efficiency limitation, but is technically more complex. Our analysis demonstrates super-classical sensitivity under most realistic conditions of loss and detector inefficiency, thereby leveraging the resources of squeezing and the principles of SU(1,1) interference, while maintaining compatibility with standard Sagnac configurations.</p>

            <p>A rotating surface can induce a frequency shift in incident light by changing its angular momentum, a phenomenon known as the rotational Doppler effect. This effect provides a means to estimate the angular velocity of the rotating surface. In this work, we develop a continuous-variable quantum protocol for estimating the angular velocity of a rotating surface via the rotational Doppler effect. Our approach exploits squeezed and displaced Laguerre-Gaussian modes as quantum resources, which interact with a rotating metallic disc with surface roughness. The frequency shift induced by the rotational Doppler effect is then measured using a homodyne detection scheme. By analyzing the Fisher information, we demonstrate that the proposed squeezing-enhanced protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling in the ideal noiseless regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of noise and consider different surface models to assess their impact on the protocol's performance. While Heisenberg scaling is degraded in the presence of noise, we show that optimizing the energy allocation ratio between displacement and squeezing of the probe ensures that the quantum strategy consistently outperforms its classical counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Effect of initial intrasystem entanglement on entropy growth in generalized Jaynes-Cummings models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daria Gaidukevich</p>
            <p>We investigate how initial intrasystem entanglement influences the entropy generated in atomic systems interacting with a photonic environment in several generalizations of the Jaynes-Cummings model with two or more subsystems. Since the initial entanglement does not uniquely determine the final entropy, we focus on ensemble-averaged behavior. We consider ensembles of initial system states including pure and mixed Haar-random states, ensembles with fixed average energy or fixed mixedness, and varying initial photon numbers in the environment. In all cases, we observe a positive correlation between the initial entanglement and the entropy growth, although the fractional contribution of the initial entanglement varies. Our results emphasize the role of intrasystem correlations as a factor contributing to entropy growth in quantum informational processes.</p>

            <h2>Dicke Superradiance in Extended 2D Quantum Arrays Coupled to Metasurface Bound States in the Continuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Eyles, Emmanuel Lassalle, Adam Stokes, Ahsan Nazir, Ramón Paniagua-Domínguez</p>
            <p>Dicke superradiance is a collective phenomenon where the emission from ensembles of quantum emitters is coherently enhanced beyond the sum of each emitter's independent emission. Here, we propose a platform that exploits the delocalised nature of a high-Q, non-local mode supported by a dielectric metasurface (a so-called bound-state-in-the-continuum or BIC) to induce superradiant behaviour within an extended two-dimensional array of distant quantum emitters. We show that these BIC-mediated emitter interactions can span several wavelengths, thus overcoming the traditional subwavelength separation between emitters required in free space. We further show that reaching the idealised Dicke limit is possible in this system, provided that the emitters are coupled to the BIC mode efficiently enough, as quantified through the $\beta$-factor. Moreover, we demonstrate its experimental viability by analysing its robustness to realistic experimental imperfections. This work puts forward optical metasurfaces supporting BICs as a physically viable platform for realising the upper limits of cooperative emission in physically extended quantum emitter arrays.</p>

            <h2>Ising-Induced Spectral Broadening Resolves the Relaxation Bottleneck in Superradiant Masers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongze Ding, Jiuqing Liang</p>
            <p>The recent observation of self-induced superradiant masing [[W. Kersten et al., Nat. Phys. 22, 158 (2026)]] revealed a collective relaxation timescale significantly slower than predicted by standard coherent transport models. Here, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this ``relaxation bottleneck.'' We show that in the high-density regime relevant to the experiment, diagonal Ising interactions -- often treated as perturbative -- generate profound inhomogeneous broadening that exceeds the intrinsic single-particle dephasing. This intense diagonal disorder suppresses resonant flip-flop exchange, effectively renormalizing the density of states available for spectral diffusion. Our parameter-free analytic theory quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed microsecond dynamics, identifying Ising-induced broadening as the governing mechanism for energy transport in dense solid-state spin ensembles.</p>

The latter, which has coefficients of odd and odd symmetry, admits a closed form solution when converted to the Abel form. Analysis of the governing condition shows that one of the nontrivial equilibrium points is stable in character. Other classes of differential equations that we encounter speak of solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions for a certain combination of underlying parameters, while, for a different set, relevance to position-dependent mass systems is shown. In addition, an interesting off-shoot of our results is the emergence of solitonic-like solutions from the condition of the level surface in the system.</p>

            <p>Multipartite entanglement determines the strength and range of interactions in many-body quantum systems. Yet, it is hard to evaluate it, due to the complex structures of quantum states. Here, we introduce a generic method to quantify the k <= N-partite entanglement of an N-particle system, by maximizing an arbitrary bipartite entanglement measure within subsystems of size up to k. The resulting classification of multipartite states captures their experimental cost: creating a k-partite entangled state requires at least k-1 two-particle entangling gates. Further, we analytically calculate the newly defined k-partite entanglement of formation, which generalizes an important bipartite entanglement measure, in several classes of states, including the W states of any dimension.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Boundary Time Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sukrut Mondkar, Priya Ghosh, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the existence of a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in a dissipative collective-spin model that exhibits the boundary time crystal (BTC) phase. We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soubhadra Maiti, Guus Avis, Sounak Kar, Stephanie Wehner</p>
            <p>We investigate the hardware requirements for quantum teleportation in an intercity-scale network topology consisting of two metropolitan-scale networks connected via a long-distance backbone link. Specifically, we identify the minimal improvements required beyond the state-of-the-art to achieve an end-to-end expected teleportation fidelity of $2/3$, which represents the classical limit. To this end, we formulate the hardware requirements computation as optimisation problems, where the hardware parameters representing the underlying device capabilities serve as decision variables. Assuming a simplified noise model, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the teleportation fidelity and rate when the network is realised using heterogeneous quantum hardware, including a quantum repeater chain with a memory cut-off. Our derivations are based on events defined by the order statistics of link generation durations in both the metropolitan networks and the backbone, and the resulting expressions are validated through simulations on the NetSquid platform. The analytical expressions facilitate efficient exploration of the optimisation parameter space without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We then apply this framework to a representative realisation in which the metropolitan nodes are based on trapped-ion processors and the backbone is composed of ensemble-based quantum memories. Our results suggest that teleportation across metropolitan distances is already achievable with state-of-the-art hardware when the data qubit is prepared after end-to-end entanglement has already been established, whereas extending teleportation to intercity scales requires additional, though plausibly achievable, improvements in hardware performance.</p>

Our key observation is that high-temperature states can be sparse in the Pauli or Majorana bases, approaching the identity at infinite temperature.

We provide analytic guarantees for small-coefficient truncation and Pauli-weight (Majorana-length) truncation strategies by quantifying the error growth and the impact of backflow. Large-scale numerics on the 1D J1-J2 model (energies) and the triangular-lattice Hubbard model (static correlations) validate efficiency at high temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum fields from real-time ensemble dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Zhang</p>
            <p>Relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) is commonly formulated in terms of operators, asymptotic states, and covariant amplitudes, a perspective that tends to obscure the real-time origin of field dynamics and correlations. Here we formulate quantum fields in a real-time Schrödinger-picture framework, in which fields evolve as probability ensembles on the space of field configurations. Within this formulation, the wavefunctional $\Psi[\phi,t]$ encodes a first-order, causal ensemble dynamics on configuration space. Interactions appear as couplings between configuration-space directions, while propagators arise as derived correlation structures rather than as fundamental postulates. Entanglement, scattering amplitudes, and conformal field theory correlators emerge as distinct projections of the same underlying ensemble evolution, corresponding to equal-time, asymptotic, and symmetry-organized observables. Standard operator, diagrammatic, and path-integral formulations are recovered as computational representations of this single real-time dynamics. This organization makes explicit the distinction between fundamental dynamical structure and representational tools in QFT, and clarifies the scope within which ensemble-averaged correlators account for quantum fluctuations, while also delineating the level at which questions associated with individual realizations and randomness would arise beyond the correlator-based field-theoretic description.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Computing Framework for VLBI Data Correlation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Liu</p>
            <p>We present a quantum computing framework for VLBI data correlation. We point out that a classical baseband time series data of length $N$ can be embedded into a quantum superposition state using amplitude encoding with only $\log_2 N$ qubits. The basic VLBI correlation and fringe fitting operations, including fringe rotation, Fourier transform, delay compensation, and cross correlation, can be implemented via quantum algorithms with significantly reduced computational complexity. We construct a full quantum processing pipeline and validate its feasibility and accuracy through direct comparison with a classical VLBI pipeline. We recognize that amplitude encoding of large data volumes remains the primary bottleneck in quantum computing; however, the quantized nature of VLBI raw data helps reduce the state-preparation complexity. Our investigation demonstrates that quantum computation offers a promising paradigm for VLBI data correlation and is likely to play a role in future VLBI systems.</p>

            <p>UGA-SSMRPT2, the spin-free perturbative analogue of Mukerjee's State-Specific Multireference Coupled Cluster Theory (MkMRCC) is known to be successful for size-extensive and intruder-free construction of dissociation curves. This work demonstrates that UGA-SSMRPT2 is also an accurate and computationally inexpensive framework for computing excitation energies. The method achieves near-chemical accuracy for the vast majority of $\pi \to \pi^*$, $n \to \pi^*$, charge-transfer, valence-Rydberg and Rydberg excited states commonly used for benchmarking electronic structure theories for excited states. Our results demonstrate that UGA-SSMRPT2 excitation energies lie within 0.20 eV of EOM-CCSD and/or well-established theoretical best estimates often surpassing the popular MRPT2 approaches like NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MCQDPT while typically requiring smaller active spaces. Its state-specific formulation circumvents the well-known intruder-state problem and eliminates the need for empirical parameters such as IPEA shifts in CASPT2. This work proposes UGA-SSMRPT2 as a robust, and scalable approach for modeling challenging electronic excited states.</p>

The setup excites the sample with a laser and acquires a spectrum at each spatial coordinate in a raster scan pattern.

Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission. The system integrates Python-based hardware control for motorized stages, spectrometer acquisition, and post-processing, with a migration to a galvo-mirror scanning approach for using it along with a cryostat for low temperature measurements. Our results demonstrate spatially resolved PL maps and temperature-dependent spectra, highlighting the capability of the setup to efficiently benchmark SPE performance. We further went on to perform automation of other experiments such as a Non-Linear Interferometry setup for Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and a Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy using a common path birefringence Interferometer to obtain hyperspectral images of our samples.</p>

Moreover, the extrapolation of these series to $\hbar=0$ unveils the correspondence between the bifurcation energy of classical resonances and the energy of the series of quantum resonances in the semiclassical limit $\hbar\to0$. Additionally, in order to obtain analytical expressions for our results, a semiclassical theory is developed.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a third fundamental branch of magnetism, combining the vanishing net magnetization of antiferromagnets with the high-momentum-dependent spin splitting of ferromagnets. This study provides a comprehensive real- and momentum-space analysis of topological phases in two-dimensional d-wave altermagnets. By employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian, we characterize the topological phase transition occurring at a critical intra-sublattice hopping strength ($t_a^C$). We examine the emergence of Dirac nodal points and the resulting Berry curvature singularities, supported by a visual analysis of pseudospin texture winding. Crucially, we analize spin splitting, effective altermagnetic strength, and investigate the transport implications of these phases, uncovering giant conductivity anisotropy and spin-dependent "steering" effects driven by group velocity distribution across the Fermi surface. Beyond bulk properties, we analyze the edge state topology in ribbon geometries through the lens of information-theoretic markers like fidelity-susceptibility and inverse participation ratio, offering an alternative to traditional Chern number calculations. Our results demonstrate that the hybridization of edge states in ultra-narrow nanoribbons opens a controllable energy gap, a feature we exploit to propose a novel topological altermagnetic field-effect transistor design where ballistic and spatially spin-polarized transport can be electrostatically gated. This work establishes a theoretical and information-theoretic framework for "edgetronics" in altermagnetic materials, paving the way for next-generation, high-speed spintronic and "spin-splitter" logic devices and architectures.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian rotation-time reversal (RT)-symmetric spin models possess two distinct phases, the unbroken phase in which the entire spectrum is real and the broken phase which contains complex eigenspectra, thereby indicating a transition point, referred to as an exceptional point. We report that the dynamical quantities, namely the short- and long-time average of the Loschmidt echo which is the overlap between the initial and the final states, and the corresponding rate function, can faithfully predict the exceptional point. In particular, when the initial state is prepared as the ground state in the unbroken phase of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the system is quenched to either the broken or unbroken phase, we analytically demonstrate that the rate function and the average Loschmidt echo can distinguish between the quench that occurred in the broken or the unbroken phase for the nearest-neighbor non-Hermitian $XY$ model with uniform and alternating magnetic fields, thereby indicating the exceptional point. Furthermore, we exhibit that such quantities are capable of identifying the exceptional point even in models like the non-Hermitian short- and long-range $XYZ$ model with magnetic field which can only be solved numerically, thereby establishing it as detection criteria for recognizing exceptional points.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian model exhibits counterintuitive phenomena that are not observed in the Hermitian counterparts. To probe the competition between non-Hermitian and Hermitian interacting components of the Hamiltonian, we focus on a system containing non-Hermitian $XY$ spin chain and Hermitian Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Aharony (KSEA) interactions along with the transverse magnetic field. We show that the non-Hermitian model can be an effective Hamiltonian of a Hermitian $XX$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ with KSEA interaction and a local magnetic field that interacts with local and nonlocal reservoirs. The analytical expression of the energy spectrum divides the system parameters into two regimes: in one region, the strength of Hermitian KSEA interactions dominates over the imaginary non-Hermiticity parameter, while in the other, the opposite is true. In the former situation, we demonstrate that the nearest-neighbor entanglement and its derivative can identify quantum critical lines with the variation of the magnetic field. In this domain, we determine a surface where the entanglement vanishes, similar to the factorization surface, known in the Hermitian case. On the other hand, when non-Hermiticity parameters dominate, we report the exceptional and critical points where the energy gap vanishes and illustrate that bipartite entanglement is capable of detecting these transitions as well. Going beyond this scenario, when the ground state evolves after a sudden quench with the transverse magnetic field, both the rate function and the fluctuation of bipartite entanglement quantified via its second moment can detect critical lines generated without quenching dynamics.</p>

            <p>Mathematical analysis of the spectral properties of the time evolution operator in quantum walks is essential for understanding key dynamical behaviors such as localization and long-term evolution. The inhomogeneous three-state case, in particular, poses substantial analytical challenges due to its higher internal degrees of freedom and the absence of translational invariance. We develop a general framework for the spectral analysis of three-state quantum walks on the one-dimensional lattice with arbitrary time evolution operators. Our approach is based on a transfer matrix formulation that reduces the infinite-dimensional eigenvalue problem to a tractable system of two-dimensional recursions, enabling exact characterization of eigenstates. This framework applies broadly to space-inhomogeneous models, including those with finite defects and two-phase structures. We rigorously derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of point spectrum, along with a complete description of the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenstates, which are known to underlie quantum localization phenomena. Furthermore, we give a complete spectral decomposition -- discrete spectrum, flat-band eigenvalues (of infinite multiplicity), and absolutely continuous spectrum -- with explicit characterization of each component. Using this method, we perform exact numerical analyses of the Fourier walk with spatial inhomogeneity, revealing the emergence of localization despite its delocalized nature in the homogeneous case. Our results provide mathematical tools and physical insights into the structure of quantum walks, offering a systematic path for identifying and characterizing localized quantum states in complex quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum Teleportation is a very useful scheme for transferring quantum information. Given that the quantum information is encoded in a state of a system of distinguishable particles, and given that the shared bi-partite entangled state is also that of a system of distinguishable particles, the $\textit{optimal teleportation fidelity}$ of the shared state is known to be $(F_{max}d+1)/(d+1)$ with $F_{max}$ being the `maximal singlet fraction' of the shared state. However, Parity Superselection Rule (PSSR) in Fermionic Quantum Theory (FQT) puts constraint on the allowed set of physical states and operations, and thereby, leads to a different notion of Quantum entanglement - locally accessible and locally inaccessible (topological correlation). In the present work, we derive an expression for the $\textit{optimal teleportation fidelity}$ of locally accessible entanglement preservation, given that the quantum information to be teleported is encoded in fermionic modes of dimension $2^N \times 2^N$ using $2^N \times 2^N$-dim shared fermionic resource between the sender and receiver. To get the optimal teleportation fidelity in FQT, we introduce PSSR restricted twirling operations and establish fermionic state-channel isomorphism. Remarkably, we notice that the structure of the canonical form of twirl invariant fermionic shared state differs from that of the $\textit{isotropic state}$ -- the corresponding canonical invariant form for teleportation in Standard Quantum Theory (SQT). In this context, we also introduce restricted Clifford twirling operation that constitute the Unitary 2-design in case of FQT for experimentally validating such optimal average fidelity. Finally, we discuss the preservation of locally inaccessible entanglement for a class of fermionic teleportation channel.</p>

            <h2>Reweighted Time-Evolving Block Decimation for Improved Quantum Dynamics Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Guha Roy, Kevin Slagle</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating an MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competitive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.</p>

            <h2>Practical learning of multi-time statistics in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory A. L. White, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg, Charles D. Hill, Kavan Modi</p>
            <p>Randomised measurements can efficiently characterise many-body quantum states by learning the expectation values of observables with low Pauli weights. In this paper, we generalise the theoretical tools of classical shadow tomography to the temporal domain to explore multi-time phenomena. This enables us to efficiently learn the features of multi-time processes such as correlated error rates, multi-time non-Markovianity, and temporal entanglement. We test the efficacy of these tools on a noisy quantum processor to characterise its noise features. Implementing these tools requires mid-circuit instruments, typically slow or unavailable in current quantum hardware. We devise a protocol to achieve fast and reliable instruments such that these multi-time distributions can be learned to a high accuracy. This enables a compact matrix product operator representation of large processes allowing us to showcase a reconstructed 20-step process (whose naive dimensionality is that of a 42-qubit state). Our techniques are pertinent to generic quantum stochastic dynamical processes, with a scope ranging across condensed matter physics, quantum biology, and in-depth diagnostics of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Group-Adapted Irreducible Matrix Units for the Walled Brauer Algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Studziński, Tomasz Młynik, Marek Mozrzymas, Michał Horodecki, Dmitry Grinko</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the representation theory of the algebra of partially transposed permutation operators, $\mathcal{A}^d_{p,p}$, which provides a matrix representation for the abstract walled Brauer algebra. This algebra has recently gained significant attention due to its relevance in quantum information theory, particularly in the efficient quantum circuit implementation of the mixed Schur-Weyl transform. In contrast to previous Gelfand-Tsetlin type approaches, our main technical contribution is the explicit construction of irreducible matrix units in the second-highest ideal that are group-adapted to the action of $\mathbb{C}[S_p]\times \mathbb{C}[S_p]$ subalgebra, where $S_p$ is the symmetric group. This approach suggests a recursive method for constructing irreducible matrix units in the remaining ideals of the algebra. The framework is general and applies to systems with arbitrary numbers of components and local dimensions. In addition, we present a complementary construction method based on tensor networks of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the unitary group. This approach enables the construction of all group-adapted irreducible matrix units, but requires knowledge of certain Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. This method can be successfully applied for a reasonably small number of particles with the support of dedicated software. The obtained results are applied to a special class of operators motivated by the mathematical formalism appearing in all variants of the port-based teleportation protocols through the mixed Schur-Weyl duality. We demonstrate that the given irreducible matrix units are, in fact, eigenoperators for the considered class.</p>

            <h2>Trotter error and gate complexity of the SYK and sparse SYK models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyuan Chen, Jonas Helsen, Maris Ozols</p>
            <p>The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a prominent model of strongly interacting fermions that serves as a toy model of quantum gravity and black hole physics. In this work, we study the Trotter error and gate complexity of the quantum simulation of the SYK model using Lie--Trotter--Suzuki formulas. Building on recent results by Chen and Brandão (arXiv:2111.05324), we derive bounds on the first- and higher-order Trotter error of the SYK model, and subsequently find near-optimal gate complexities for simulating these models. For the $k$-local SYK model on $n$ Majorana fermions, at time $t$, our gate complexity estimates for the first-order Lie--Trotter--Suzuki formula scales with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+\frac{5}{2}}t^2)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+3}t^2)$ for odd $k$, and the gate complexity of simulations using higher-order formulas scales with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+\frac{1}{2}}t)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+1}t)$ for odd $k$. Given that the SYK model has $\Theta(n^k)$ terms, these estimates are close to optimal. These gate complexities can be further improved upon in the context of simulating the time evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$, leading to a $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$-reduction in gate complexity for first-order and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$-reduction for higher-order formulas. Regarding the sparse SYK model, which is a simplified variant of the SYK model obtained by deleting all but a $\Theta(n)$ fraction of the terms in a uniformly i.i.d. manner, our average gate complexity estimates for higher-order formulas scale as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1+\frac{1}{2}} t)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{2} t)$ for odd $k$. Similar to the full SYK model, we obtain a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$-reduction simulating the time evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase classification via partial tomography-based quantum hypothesis testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akira Tanji, Hiroshi Yano, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Quantum phase classification is a fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics, traditionally approached using order parameters or quantum machine learning techniques such as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs). However, these methods often require extensive prior knowledge of the system or large numbers of quantum state copies for reliable classification. In this work, we propose a classification algorithm based on the quantum Neyman-Pearson test, which is theoretically optimal for distinguishing between two quantum states. While directly constructing the optimal test for many-body systems via full state tomography is intractable due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, we introduce a partitioning strategy that applies hypothesis tests to subsystems rather than the entire state, effectively reducing the required number of quantum state copies while maintaining classification accuracy. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating its advantages over conventional methods, including the order parameter-based classifier, the QCNN, and the recently developed classical machine learning algorithm enhanced with quantum data. Our results show that the proposed method achieves lower classification error probabilities with fewer required quantum state copies compared to all of these baselines, while also reducing the training cost relative to the QCNN and the classical machine learning algorithm enhanced with quantum data, and further decreasing the classical computational time in comparison with the latter. We additionally demonstrate scalability of our method in numerical experiments up to systems with 81 qubits. These findings highlight the potential of quantum hypothesis testing as a powerful tool for quantum phase classification, particularly in experimental settings where quantum measurements are combined with classical post-processing.</p>

            <p>Microwave drives play a central role in the control of superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit gates, readout, and parametric interactions. As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multiphoton pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles (QPs) and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multiphoton-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by charge- or flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that photon-assisted QP generation may affect novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving.</p>

We compare the performance to the case where the entangling component of the measurement is suppressed. We further apply the collective measurement to quantum state tomography, observing a near-optimal scaling of the infidelity with the total number of samples.</p>

Compared to Gour's protocol \cite{PRA2004}, our scheme requires less entanglement of Alice's measurement and fewer classical bits sent to this http URL results also show a trade-off between these two resources and derive a lower bound for their sum, quantifying their interplay in the teleportation process.</p>

            <h2>Matrix-product entanglement characterizing the optimality of state-preparation quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Qi, Wen-Jun Li, Gang Su, Shi-Ju Ran</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement offers a powerful framework for understanding the complex collective phenomena in quantum many-body systems that are often beyond the description of conventional bipartite entanglement measures. Here, we propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs with specified virtual bond dimensions $\chi$, and thus are dubbed as $\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\chi$-MPE with respect to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing $\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing $\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\mathcal{H}_{\chi} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{D}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs and $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$-layer circuits. We provide an exact proof that $\mathcal{H}_{\chi=2} \equiv \mathcal{H}_{D=1}$. Our results establish tensor networks as a powerful and general tool for developing parametrized measures of multipartite entanglement. The matrix product form adopted in $\chi$-MPE can be readily extended to other tensor network ansätze, whose scaling behaviors are expected to assess the optimality of quantum circuit in preparing the corresponding tensor network states.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agathe Blanvillain, André Chailloux, Jean-Pierre Tillich</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum decoding problem. It consists in recovering a codeword given a superposition of noisy versions of this codeword. By measuring the superposition, we get back to the classical decoding problem. It appears for the first time in Chen, Liu and Zhandry's work showing a quantum advantage for the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem for the $l_\infty$ norm. In a recent paper, Chailloux and Tillich proved that when we have a noise following a Bernoulli distribution, the quantum decoding problem can be solved in polynomial time and is therefore easier than classical decoding for which the best known algorithms have an exponential complexity. They also give an information theoretic limit for the code rate at which this problem can be solved which turns out to be above the Shannon limit. In this paper, we generalize the last result to all memoryless noise models. We also show similar results in the rank metric case which corresponds to a noise model which is not memoryless. We analyze the Pretty Good Measurement, from which we derive an information theoretic limit for this problem. By using the algorithm for the quantum decoding problem together with Regev's reduction, we derive a quantum algorithm sampling codewords from the dual code according to a probability distribution which is the dual of the original noise. It turns out that at the information theoretic limit, we get the most likely nonzero codeword of the dual code. When the distribution is a decreasing function of the weight, we find minimal nonzero codewords. Note that Regev's reduction used together with classical decoding is much less satisfying since it is not able to output those minimum weight codewords.</p>

            <h2>The Constant Geometric Speed Schedule for Adiabatic State Preparation: Towards Quadratic Speedup without Prior Spectral Knowledge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mancheon Han, Hyowon Park, Sangkook Choi</p>
            <p>The efficiency of adiabatic quantum evolution is governed by the evolution time $T$, which typically scales as $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{-2})$ with the minimum energy gap $\Delta$. However, the rigorous lower bound is $\mathcal{O}(L\Delta^{-1})$, where $L$ is the adiabatic path length. Although $L$ is formally upper-bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{-1})$, such a bound is often too loose in practice, and $L$ can be bounded independently of $\Delta$. This indicates the potential for a quadratic speedup through adiabatic schedule construction. Here, we introduce the constant geometric speed (CGS) schedule, which traverses the adiabatic path at a uniform rate. We show that this approach reduces the scaling of the evolution time by a factor of $\Delta^{-1}$, provided $L$ remains bounded independently of $\Delta$. We propose a segmented CGS protocol where path segment lengths are computed from eigenstate overlaps on the fly, eliminating the need for prior spectral knowledge. Numerical tests on adiabatic unstructured search, N$_2$, and a [2Fe-2S] cluster demonstrate the optimal $\Delta^{-1}$ scaling, confirming a quadratic speedup over the standard linear schedule.</p>

            <h2>Resilience of Entanglement-Induced Coordination in Adversarial Environments: The Team-Based Quantum Sabotage Game</h2>

            <p>Quantumgametheoryextendsclassical strategic decision-making by incorporating quantum superposition, entanglement, and measurement-induced randomness into competitive interactions. This paper introduces a team-based Quantum Sabotage Game (QSG), in which classical and quantum-enhanced teams engage in adversarial decision-making under identical information constraints. Unlike baseline classical teams, whose members act independently, quantum teams employ entanglement-assisted coor dination, generating structured correlations among decentralized actions without classical communication. We develop a formal quantum game-theoretic framework and analyze multi-agent strategies using Bell and Wentangled states, benchmarked against size-equivalent classical teams. Using numerical simulations, we compare outcome distributions, correlation structure, and robustness under ideal conditions, standard quantum noise models, and a device-inspired, reproducible hardware-like noise model via the Qiskit Aer FakeKyiv backend. While the symmetric payoff structure precludes any asymptotic increase in expected utility, multipartite entanglement, particularly W-state correlations, reshapes the finite-run joint-action distribution, producing nonclassical coordination patterns rather than an expectation-value advantage. These patterns persist under realistic noise, demonstrating that the resulting correlation signatures remain observable and differ from those produced by independent classical sampling. These results clarify the operational role of entanglement in adversarial environments, distinguishing correlation-based coordination from expectation-value advantage, and establish the Quantum Sabotage Game as a testbed for studying noise-resilient multi-agent quantum decision-making.</p>

            <p>We study the emergence of quantum memory effects in a spin-boson system at finite temperature driven by an external time-periodic force. Quantifying memory effects by the trace-distance based measure for non-Markovianity and performing numerical simulations employing the hierarchical equations of motion approach, we find a pronounced peak structure when plotting the non-Markovianity measure as a function of the driving amplitude. This distinctive feature is interpreted using Floquet theory and the Floquet-Lindblad master equation, associating the peaks with the degeneracies of the quasienergy spectrum which lead to a strong enhancement of the relaxation times of the system. These results suggest strategies for the efficient control of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems by periodic driving.</p>

            <p>Drawing inspiration from gradient-descent methods developed for data processing in quantum state tomography [\href{this https URL}{Quantum Sci.~Technol.~\textbf{10} 045055 (2025)}] and quantum process tomography [\href{this https URL}{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{130}, 150402 (2023)}], we introduce stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for fast quantum measurement tomography (QMT), applicable to both discrete- and continuous-variable quantum systems -- thus completing the tomography trio. A measurement device or detector in a quantum experiment is characterized by a set of positive operator-valued measure (POVM) elements; the goal of QMT is to estimate these operators from experimental data. To ensure physically valid (positive and complete) POVM reconstructions, we propose two distinct parameterization schemes within the SGD framework: one leveraging optimization on a Stiefel manifold and one based on Hermitian operator normalization via eigenvalue scaling. Within the SGD-QMT framework, we further investigate two loss functions: mean squared error, equivalent to L2 or Euclidean norm, and average negative log-likelihood, inspired by maximum likelihood estimation. We benchmark performance against state-of-the-art constrained convex optimization methods. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to standard methods, our SGD-QMT algorithms offer significantly lower computational cost, superior reconstruction fidelity, and enhanced robustness to noise. We make a Python implementation of the SGD-QMT algorithms publicly available at \href{this https URL}{this http URL}.</p>

            <p>Within finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), we distinguish between the geometric transition probability tau(psi,phi), defined as the maximum probability of accepting phi when the state is psi, and the predictive probability P(phi|psi) assigned to measurement outcomes. We ask what functional relationship P = Phi(tau) is compatible with relativistic causality. We prove that in any GPT satisfying purification, and therefore admitting steering, the only such relationship consistent with no-signaling is the identity Phi(p) = p. Any strictly convex or concave deviation from linearity enables superluminal signaling through steering scenarios. We provide an explicit qubit example showing how nonlinear probability rules generate detectable signaling channels. Combined with standard reconstruction results, this yields the Born rule |<phi|psi>|^2 as the unique causally consistent probability assignment. Our analysis clarifies the distinction between geometric structure and probabilistic prediction in quantum theory, and identifies steering as the mechanism enforcing the Born rule.</p>

            <p>We study composite open quantum systems with a finite-dimensional state space ${\mathcal H}_A\otimes {\mathcal H}_B$ governed by a Lindblad equation $\rho'(t) = {\mathcal L}_\gamma \rho(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_\gamma\rho = -i[H,\rho] + \gamma {\mathcal D} \rho$, and ${\mathcal D}$ is a dissipator ${\mathcal D}_A\otimes I$ acting non-trivially only on part $A$ of the system, which can be thought of as the boundary, and $\gamma$ is a parameter. It is known that the dynamics simplifies for large $\gamma$: after a time of order $\gamma^{-1}$, $\rho(t)$ is well approximated for times small compared to $\gamma^2$ by $\pi_A\otimes R(t)$ where $\pi_A$ is a steady state of ${\mathcal D}_A$, and $R(t)$ is a solution of $\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}t}R(t) = {\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma}R(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma} R := -i[H_P,R] + \gamma^{-1} {\mathcal D}_P R$ with $H_P$ being a Hamiltonian on ${\mathcal H}_B$ and ${\mathcal D}_P$ being a Lindblad generator over ${\mathcal H}_B$. We prove this assuming only that ${\mathcal D}_A$ is ergodic and gapped. In order to better control the long time behavior, and study the steady states $\bar\rho_\gamma$, we introduce a third Lindblad generator ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ that does not involve $\gamma$, but still closely related to ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$. We show that if ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ is ergodic and gapped, then so is ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$ for all large $\gamma$, and if $\bar\rho_\gamma$ denotes the unique steady state for ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$, then $\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes \bar R$ where $\bar R$ is the unique steady state for ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$.

            <p>The emergence of states with long-range correlations in a disordered landscape is rare, as disorder typically suppresses the particle mobility required for long-range coherence. But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction. We also visualize the spectrum by measuring the dynamical structure factor. A linearly-dispersing phonon mode materializes in the superfluid, appearing even when disorder is introduced to the clean Mott insulator. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity.</p>

            <p>Accurate extraction of linearized quantum circuit models from electromagnetic simulations is essential for the design of superconducting circuits. We present a quantization framework based on the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ seen by a Josephson junction embedded in an arbitrary passive linear environment. By taking the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, we show that the linearized coupled system obeys an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition, $s Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$, whose roots determine the dressed linear mode frequencies. This boundary condition admits an exact continued fraction representation: any positive-real admittance can be realized as a canonical Cauer ladder, yielding a tridiagonal (Jacobi) structure that enables certified convergence bounds via interlacing this http URL the full nonlinear Hamiltonian, we treat Josephson junctions in the charge basis, where each cosine potential is exactly tridiagonal, and couple them to cavity modes in the Fock basis; in the general multi-junction case this yields a block-tridiagonal structure solvable by matrix continued fractions, enabling systematic diagonalization across all coupling regimes from dispersive through ultrastrong and deep strong coupling. The resulting quantization procedure is: (i)~compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii)~solve the boundary condition to obtain dressed eigenfrequencies, (iii)~synthesize an equivalent passive network, and (iv)~quantize while retaining the full cosine nonlinearity of the Josephson junction. We prove that junction participation decays as $\mathcal{O}(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies for any circuit with finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative corrections without imposed cutoffs.</p>

We further enhance HSQD with a heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) inspired selection of the samples, forming HCI-HSQD. This yields sub-millihartree accuracy across the N2 potential energy surface and produces subspaces up to 39% smaller than those from classical HCI, showing a significant improvement in the compactness of the ground-state representation. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of HCI-HSQD using iron-sulfur clusters, reaching active spaces of up to (54e, 36o) while using only half as many qubits as the original SQD. For these systems, HCI-HSQD reduces SQD energy errors by up to 76% for [2Fe-2S] and 26% for [4Fe-4S], while also reducing subspace sizes, halving measurement requirements, and eliminating expensive post-processing. Together, these results establish half-qubit SQD as a noise-resilient and resource-efficient pathway toward practical quantum advantage in strongly correlated chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation with a Many-Body Physics Inspired Inductive Bias</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre, Marius Krumm, Hans J. Briegel</p>
            <p>With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However, most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits, including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waranon Sroyngoen, James R. Anglin</p>
            <p>An atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate can be considered as an open quantum system. The soliton's breathing mode, for example, is damped by emission of atoms from the soliton to spatial infinity, which thus acts as a Markovian environment for the soliton. If the soliton is held in a shallow harmonic trap, however, the environment becomes non-Markovian: emitted atoms oscillate in the trap and eventually return to the soliton, interfering with it, producing periodic revivals of the breathing mode ("resuscitations"). The amplitude envelopes of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, with a gradual increase in breathing amplitude followed by sudden drop in amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern in the non-Markovian revivals by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum for the weakly trapped soliton.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational redshift of broadband relativistic quantum photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Lapponi, Alessandro Ferreri, David Edward Bruschi</p>
            <p>We employ linearized quantum gravity to study gravitational redshift of photons in the context of relativistic and quantum physics, where photons interact in flat spacetime with a classical massive body via graviton exchange. We find that gravitational redshift, as predicted by general relativity, occurs only in the case of localized photons with a well defined momentum that interact with a classical source of gravitons. On the contrary, photons initially prepared in states with nonclassical features, such as quantum coherence in the position degree of freedom, witness no well-defined redshift in general. Our work not only shows that gravitational redshift can be found in flat spacetime as a consequence of the interaction of quantum fields, but it also challenges the robustness of one of the most important predictions of general relativity, furthermore indicating that deviations from the theory can already be observed at low energies using highly nonclassical photonic states.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array, formed in a Si$_{0.972}$Ge$_{0.028}$ quantum well, manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1$\mu$m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.</p>

            <p>Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunneling that decays as a power law with distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for continuous tuning of both the dimerization pattern and the disorder strength. Within the parameter space constrained by our geometry, we show that both mechanisms lead to a localized phase that does not resemble standard MBL. This phase can be understood as an ensemble of distinct Hilbert space fragmented realizations induced by small inter-spin separations. As dimerization is commonly associated with Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) physics, we also examine the SPT states across the entire energy spectrum. Despite a partial spin-glass order, we argue that the system hosts an extensive fraction of SPT states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitri E. Kharzeev, Azadeh Maleknejad, Saba Shalamberidze</p>
            <p>We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustabh Gogoi, Tanay Nag, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We show that both the topological (MZMs and MPMs) and trivial (TZMs and TPMs) edge modes are robust against onsite disorder. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vic Vander Linden, Boris De Vos, Kevin Vervoort, Frank Verstraete, Atsushi Ueda</p>
            <p>The quantum $5$-state Potts model is known to possess a perturbative description using complex conformal field theory (CCFT), the analytic continuation of ``theory space" to a complex plane. To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nelin Laštovičková Streshkova, Martin Kozák</p>
            <p>Coherent control of ultrafast quantum phenomena benefits from pulse-shaping capabilities allowing to modulate the envelope and instantaneous phase of optical fields on femtosecond time scales. While such control is available for optical fields, an analogy of a pulse shaper for freely propagating electrons is lacking. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate a method that enables near arbitrary light-based shaping of electron wave packets in the time domain. The method is based on the quantum phase modulation of electron waves by coherent light with time-dependent frequency leading to generation of spectrally separated electron energy side bands with shaped time-energy profiles and envelopes. Our results show that few femtosecond time durations can be achieved without additional spectral broadening of the electron wave packet, allowing one to reach the combination of high time, spatial, and spectral resolutions in ultrafast imaging and diffraction experiments with pulsed electron beams.</p>

            <p>Characterization of the dynamics of an impurity immersed in a quantum medium is vital for fundamental understanding of matter as well as applications in modern day quantum technologies. The case of strong and long-ranged interactions is of particular importance here, as it opens the possibility to leverage quantum correlations in controlling the system properties. Here, we consider a charged impurity moving in a bosonic gas and study its properties out of equilibrium. We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Schürmann</p>
            <p>In quantum theory on curved backgrounds, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is usually discussed in terms of ensemble variances and flat-space commutators. Here we take a different, preparation-based viewpoint tailored to sharp position measurements on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity. A projective localization is modeled as a von Neumann-Lüders projection onto a geodesic ball $B_\Sigma(r)$ of radius $r$ on a Cauchy slice $(\Sigma,h)$, with the post-measurement state described by Dirichlet data. Using DeWitt-type momentum operators adapted to an orthonormal frame, we construct a geometric, coordinate-invariant momentum standard deviation $\sigma_p$ and show that strict confinement to $B_\Sigma(r)$ enforces an intrinsic kinetic-energy floor. The lower bound is set by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the ball, $\sigma_p \ge \hbar\sqrt{\lambda_1}$, and is manifestly invariant under changes of coordinates and foliation. A variance decomposition separates the contribution of the modulus $|\psi|$ from phase-gradient fluctuations and clarifies how the spectral geometry of $(\Sigma,h)$ controls momentum uncertainty. Assuming only minimal geometric information, weak mean-convexity of the boundary yields a universal, scale-invariant Heisenberg-type product bound, $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, depending only on the proper radius $r$.</p>

            <p>We develop a symmetry-adapted multipolar $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory close to the bulk $\Gamma$ point for time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric $C_{3v}$ crystals in the strong atomic spin-orbit-coupling ($jj$-coupling) limit. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</p>

            <p>Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</p>

We leverage the intrinsic tunability of both nodes to optimize spectral matching, enabling direct networking between the two: single-photon storage and retrieval for 1 $\mu$s over up to 37 temporal modes across extended fibers of 10.6 km (metropolitan) and 49.2 km (laboratory) while preserving non-classicality.

            <p>Quantum jumps, the collapse of a quantum system upon measurement, are among the most striking consequences of observation in quantum mechanics. While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianlong Liu, Jie-ping Zheng, Antonio M. García-García</p>
            <p>It is intuitively expected, and supported by earlier studies, that many-body quantum chaos is suppressed, or even destroyed, by dissipative effects induced by continuous monitoring. We show here that this is not always the case. For this purpose, we study the quenched dynamics of a continuously monitored Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, described by the Lindblad formalism, coupled to a thermal environment modeled by another SYK maintained at constant temperature. We find that the combined effect of monitoring and the thermal bath drives the system toward a non-thermal steady state independently of the initial conditions. The corresponding retarded Green's function exhibits two stages of exponential decay, with rates that depend non-monotonously on the thermal bath coupling and the monitoring strength. In the limit of weak coupling, the late time decay of the Green's function, computed analytically, is closely related to that of the thermal bath. Strikingly, we identify a range of parameters in which continuous monitoring, despite being a source of decoherence, induces or enhances quantum chaotic dynamics suppressed by the thermal bath. For instance, in the limit of weak coupling to the thermal bath, the Lyapunov exponent increases sharply when monitoring is turned on. For intermediate values of the thermal bath coupling, the Lyapunov exponent exhibits re-entrant behavior: it vanishes at zero or sufficiently weak monitoring strength, and becomes positive again as the monitoring strength is increased. Our results offer intriguing insights on the mechanisms leading to quantum scrambling which paves the way to its experimental control and consequently to a performance enhancement of quantum information devices.</p>

            <p>Networks of aromatic amino acid residues within microtubules, particularly those formed by tryptophan, may serve as pathways for optical information flow. Ultraviolet excitation dynamics in these networks are typically modeled with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. By extending this approach to a Lindblad master equation that incorporates explicit site geometries and dipole orientations, we track how correlations are generated, routed, and dissipated, while capturing both energy dissipation and information propagation among coupled chromophores. We compare localized injections, fully delocalized preparations, and eigenmode-based initial states. To quantify the emerging quantum-informational structure, we evaluate the $L_1$ norm of coherence, the correlated coherence, and the logarithmic negativity within and between selected chromophore sub-networks. The results reveal a strong dependence of both the direction and persistence of information flow on the type of initial preparation. Superradiant components drive the rapid export of correlations to the environment, whereas subradiant components retain them and slow their leakage. Embedding single tubulin units into larger dimers and spirals reshapes pairwise correlation maps and enables site-selective routing. Scaling to larger ordered lattices strengthens both export and retention channels, whereas static energetic and structural disorder suppresses long-range transport and reduces overall correlation transfer. These findings provide a Lindbladian picture of information flow in cytoskeletal chromophore networks and identify structural and dynamical conditions that transiently preserve nonclassical correlations in microtubules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André R. R. Carvalho, Liam J. McClelland, Erik W. Streed, Joan Vaccaro</p>
            <p>We propose an ion-trap implementation of the Vaccaro, Barnett and Wright et al. spin-heat engine (SHE); a hypothetical engine that operates between energy and spin thermal reservoirs rather than two energy reservoirs. The SHE operates in two steps: first, in the work extraction stage, heat from a thermal energy reservoir is converted into optical work via a two photon Raman transition resonant with close-to energy degenerate spin states; second, the internal spin states are brought back to their initial state via non-energetic information erasure using a spin reservoir. The latter incurs no energy cost, but rather the reset occurs at the cost of angular momentum from a spin bath that acts as the thermal spin reservoir. The SHE represents an important first step toward demonstrating heat engines that operate beyond the conventional paradigm of requiring two thermal reservoirs, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines.</p>

            <p>Solid-state color centers are promising candidates for nodes in quantum network architectures. However, realizing scalable and fully functional quantum nodes, comprising both processor and memory qubits with high-fidelity universal gate operations, remains a central challenge in this field. Here, we demonstrate a fully functional quantum node in silicon carbide, where electron spins act as quantum processors and nuclear spins serve as quantum memory. Specifically, we design a pulse sequence that combines dynamical decoupling with hyperfine interactions to realize decoherence-protected universal gate operations between the processor and memory qubits. Leveraging this gate, we deterministically prepare entangled states within the quantum node, achieving a fidelity of 90%, which exceeds the fault-tolerance threshold of certain quantum network architectures. These results open a pathway toward scalable and fully functional quantum nodes based on silicon carbide.</p>

            <p>We report the generation of quantum entanglement between the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere, coupled by coherent scattering to an optical cavity mode, and the electromagnetic field. Using heterodyne detection, we reconstruct the full set of optical-mechanical correlations and observe a violation of separability bounds between the mechanical degrees of freedom and the propagating optical mode. Thus, we demonstrate the ability to distribute nonclassical correlations beyond the interaction region. Our results are obtained at room temperature and are robust over a broad range of detunings set by the cavity linewidth. These findings establish levitated optomechanical systems as a promising platform for macroscopic quantum optics and for future tests of fundamental physics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that offers ease of training compared to other quantum neural networks, as it does not rely on gradient-based optimization. Learning is performed in a single step on the output features measured from the quantum system. Various implementations of quantum reservoir computing have been explored in simulations, with different measured features. Although simulations have shown that quantum reservoirs present advantages in performance compared to classical reservoirs, experimental implementations have remained scarce. This is due to the challenge of obtaining a large number of output features that are nonlinear transformations of the input data. In this work, we show that even with a circuit quantum electrodynamics system as simple as a single transmon coupled to a readout resonator, we can implement a proof-of-concept realization of quantum reservoir computing. We obtain a large number of nonlinear features from a single physical system by encoding the input data in the amplitude of a coherent drive and measuring the cavity state in the Fock basis. We demonstrate classification of two classical tasks with significantly smaller hardware resources and fewer measured features compared to classical neural networks. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations that show additional Kerr nonlinearity is beneficial to reservoir performance. Our work demonstrates a hardware-efficient quantum neural network implementation that can be further scaled up and generalized to other quantum machine learning models.</p>

            <h2>Generating Entangled Steady States in Multistable Open Quantum Systems via Initial State Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Fallas Padilla, Raphael Kaubruegger, Adrianna Gillman, Stephen Becker, Ana Maria Rey</p>
            <p>Entanglement underpins the power of quantum technologies, yet it is fragile and typically destroyed by dissipation. Paradoxically, the same dissipation, when carefully engineered, can drive a system toward robust entangled steady states. However, this engineering task is nontrivial, as dissipative many-body systems are complex, particularly when they support multiple steady states. Here, we derive analytic expressions that predict how the steady state of a system evolving under a Lindblad equation depends on the initial state, without requiring integration of the dynamics. These results extend the frameworks developed in Refs. [Phys. Rev. A 89, 022118 (2014) and Phys. Rev. X 6, 041031 (2016)], showing that while the steady-state manifold is determined by the Liouvillian kernel, the weights within it depend on both the Liouvillian and the initial state. We identify a special class of Liouvillians for which the steady state depends only on the initial overlap with the kernel. Our framework provides analytical insight and a computationally efficient tool for predicting steady states in open quantum systems. As an application, we propose schemes to generate metrologically useful entangled steady states in spin ensembles via balanced collective decay.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Yona, Yaron Oz</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that charge teleportation serves as a superior observable for Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET)-based cryptographic primitives. While following the LOCC protocol structure of earlier proposals, we show that decoding key bits via local charge rather than energy provides exact bit symmetry and enhanced robustness: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kean Chen, Nengkun Yu, Zhicheng Zhang</p>
            <p>We study the estimation of an unknown quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$ with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. We establish a connection between the query complexities in two models: (i) access to $\mathcal{E}$, and (ii) access to a random dilation of $\mathcal{E}$. Specifically, we show that for parallel (possibly coherent) testers, access to dilations does not help. This is proved by constructing a local tester that uses $n$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ yet faithfully simulates the tester with $n$ queries to a random dilation. As application, we show that: - $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$. Moreover, when $rd_2=d_1$, we show that the Heisenberg scaling $O(1/\varepsilon)$ can be achieved, even if $\mathcal{E}$ is not a unitary channel: - $O(\min\{d_1^{2.5}/\varepsilon,d_1^2/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$, and $O(d_1^2/\varepsilon)$ queries suffice for the case of Choi state trace norm error $\varepsilon$. - $O(\min\{d_1^{1.5}/\varepsilon,d_1/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for tomography of the mixed state $\mathcal{E}(|0\rangle\langle 0|)$ to within trace norm error $\varepsilon$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel H. S. Aguiar, George E. A. Matsas</p>
            <p>The concept of quantum particles derives from quantum field theory. Accepting that quantum mechanics is valid all the way implies that not only composite particles (such as protons and neutrons) would be derived from a field theory, but also the center of mass of bodies as heavy as rocks. Despite the fabulous success of quantum mechanics, it is unreasonable to assume the existence of annihilation and creation operators for rocks, and so on. Fortunately, there are strong reasons to doubt that wave mechanics can describe the center of mass of systems at or above the Planck scale, thereby jeopardizing the construction of the corresponding Fock space. As a result, systems with masses exceeding the Planck mass would have their center of mass described through classical mechanics, regardless of being able to harbor macroscopic quantum phenomena as observed in the laboratory. Here, we briefly revisit (i) the arguments for the need for a Heisenberg cut delimitating the boundary between the quantum and classical realms and (ii) the kind of new physics expected at (the uncharted region of) the Heisenberg cut.''</p>

            <h2>Noise-Resilient Quantum Chemistry with Half the Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane McFarthing, Aidan Pellow-Jarman, Francesco Petruccione</p>
            <p>Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) offers a powerful route to accurate quantum chemistry on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices by combining quantum sampling with classical diagonalization. Here we introduce HSQD, a novel half-qubit SQD approach that halves the qubit requirement for simulating a chemical system and drastically reduces overall circuit depth and gate counts, suppressing hardware noise. When modeling the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule with a (10e, 26o) active space, HSQD matches the accuracy of SQD on IBM quantum hardware using only half the number of qubits and 40% fewer measurements. We further enhance HSQD with a heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) inspired selection of the samples, forming HCI-HSQD. This yields sub-millihartree accuracy across the N2 potential energy surface and produces subspaces up to 39% smaller than those from classical HCI, showing a significant improvement in the compactness of the ground-state representation. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of HCI-HSQD using iron-sulfur clusters, reaching active spaces of up to (54e, 36o) while using only half as many qubits as the original SQD. For these systems, HCI-HSQD reduces SQD energy errors by up to 76% for [2Fe-2S] and 26% for [4Fe-4S], while also reducing subspace sizes, halving measurement requirements, and eliminating expensive post-processing. Together, these results establish half-qubit SQD as a noise-resilient and resource-efficient pathway toward practical quantum advantage in strongly correlated chemistry.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dissipative dynamics of a two-level atom in a weak gravitational field. Using the Feynman--Vernon influence functional formalism, we derive a quantum master equation describing the two-level atom interacting with a scalar field in a Newtonian gravitational field, and compute the energy dissipation rate of the atom. We find that the spontaneous emission rate (the dissipation rate in vacuum) is modified by the gravitational field. Specifically, this modification depends on the atom's dipole, the position of the atom relative to the source of the gravitational field, and the frequency of the scalar radiation emitted by the atom. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regimes in which the spontaneous emission rate is enhanced or suppressed by gravity. We also discuss how the modification arises from time dilation and dipole radiation in a weak gravitational field. These findings provide a theoretical basis for exploring gravitational effects in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The rapid advancement of quantum computing has led to the development of various quantum libraries, empowering compilation, simulation, and hardware backend interfaces. However, ensuring the correctness of these libraries remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of mature testing methodologies. The state-of-the-art tools often rely on domain-specific configurations and expert knowledge, which limits their accessibility and scalability in practice. Furthermore, although these tools demonstrate strong performance, they adopt measurement-based for output validation in testing, which makes them produce false positive reports. To alleviate these limitations, we propose QSPE, a practical approach that follows the differential testing principle and extends the existing approach, SPE, for quantum libraries. QSPE is fully automated, requiring no pre-set configurations or domain expertise, and can effectively generate a large set of diverse program variants that comprehensively explore the quantum compilation space. To mitigate the possible false positive reports, we propose statevector-based validation as an alternative to measurement-based validation. In our experiments, the QSPE approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in generating 22,770 program variants across multiple quantum computing platforms. By avoiding $\alpha$-equivalence at the quantum and classical program wise, QSPE can reduce redundant generation and save more than 90\% of execution cost. Finally, the statevector-based validation method assists QSPE to reduce false alarms and effectively detects 708 miscompilations across multiple quantum libraries. Notably, 81 of the discovered bugs have been officially approved and acknowledged by the Qiskit development team, demonstrating the practical impact of our approach.</p>

            <p>Machine Learning (ML) has been widely applied across numerous domains due to its ability to automatically identify informative patterns from data for various tasks. The availability of large-scale data and advanced computational power enables the development of sophisticated models and training strategies, leading to state-of-the-art performance, but it also introduces substantial challenges. Quantum Computing (QC), which exploits quantum mechanisms for computation, has attracted growing attention and significant global investment as it may address these challenges. Consequently, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the integration of these two fields, has received increasing interest, with a notable rise in related studies in recent years. We are motivated to review these existing contributions regarding quantum circuit-based learning models for classical data analysis and highlight the identified potentials and challenges of this technique. Specifically, we focus not only on QML models, both kernel-based and neural network-based, but also on recent explorations of their integration with classical machine learning layers within hybrid frameworks. Moreover, we examine both theoretical analysis and empirical findings to better understand their capabilities, and we also discuss the efforts on noise-resilient and hardware-efficient QML that could enhance its practicality under current hardware limitations. In addition, we cover several emerging paradigms for advanced quantum circuit design and highlight the adaptability of QML across representative application domains. This study aims to provide an overview of the contributions made to bridge quantum computing and machine learning, offering insights and guidance to support its future development and pave the way for broader adoption in the coming years.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matheus Eiji Ohno Bezerra, Valery Shchesnovich</p>
            <p>Photon distinguishability is a fundamental property manifested in multiphoton interference and one of the main sources of noise in any photonic quantum information processing. In this work, rather than relying on first-quantization methods, we build on a generating-function framework based on the phase-space formalism to characterize the effects of partial distinguishability on the interference of single-mode squeezed states. Our approach goes beyond commonly used models that represent distinguishability via additional noninterfering modes and captures genuine multiphoton interference effects induced by the overlap of the internal state of the photons. This description provides a clear physical account of how distinguishability gives rise to effective noise in Gaussian boson sampling protocols while enabling a systematic investigation of phase effects arising from the overlap of the internal states.</p>

            <p>Compatibility with existing classical network infrastructure offers a scalable path towards deploying largescale quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate O-band polarization-encoded quantum entanglement distribution over an installed 24.4-km fiber while coexisting with a state-of-the-art fully-loaded C-band classical communications line system and a picosecond-level precision L-band synchronization signal. The classical system carries two 800-Gbps channels while the remainder of the C-band is filled with amplified spontaneous emission as is standard for such state-of-the-art communications systems. We examine the spontaneous Raman scattering spectrum generated from this broadband C-band light and offer insights into wavelength allocation for O-band quantum channels. Optimal wavelength selection and narrow filtering enable well-preserved Bell state fidelity when coexisting with 21.4-dBm aggregate launch power across the C-band suitable for 36 Tbps transmission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of entanglement-based quantum communications between two remote nodes coexisting with independent classical communications traffic.

            <p>Correlated microwave photon sources are key enablers for technologies in quantum-limited sensing, signal amplification and communication, but the reliance on millikelvin operating temperature limits their scalability for broader applications. Here, at room temperature, we demonstrate strong correlated microwave signals emitted from a hybrid magnon-photon platform. Different from traditional parametrically induced magnons with degenerate frequencies, we achieve non-degenerate excitations by coupling magnon modes simultaneously with two cavity photon modes. Through the magnon-photon interactions in the corresponding linear and nonlinear regimes, one input microwave photon splits into a pair of magnon polaritons that possess distinct frequencies but maintain strong inter-mode correlations. The nonlinear magnon polariton dynamics empowered by this new parametric platform brings both verified true randomness and robust multi-channel correlations, from which we construct a microwave communication experiment for noise resilient signal transmission with added security. This work establishes cavity magnonics as a versatile and compact platform for generating correlated multi-mode microwave signals, opening new avenues for applications in classical and quantum domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Yu, Mingzhu Weng, Zhihai Wang, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, reduced dynamics is commonly described by a master equation, whose Liouvillian gap closing (LGC) typically signals the emergence of decoherence-free subspace. By contrast, the dynamics of the full system-environment compound is governed by the underlying Hamiltonian spectrum, where bound states in the continuum (BICs) can protect long-lived quantum resources. Despite these parallel perspectives, the relation between LGC and BIC formation has remained largely unexplored. Here we bridge this gap in a paradigmatic giant-atom waveguide platform and show that the occurrence of LGC necessarily benchmarks the presence of a BIC in the full Hamiltonian description. By engineering the giant-atom geometry, we further demonstrate rich dynamical regimes-including Rabi oscillations, fractional decay, and complete exponential relaxation-depending on the number of supported BICs, which can be tuned from three to zero. Remarkably, when two BICs become frequency-degenerate, the long-time dynamics approaches a steady state rather than exhibiting persistent oscillations. Our results establish a direct spectral-dynamical connection between effective Markovian and underlying non-Markovian descriptions, and provide a route toward flexible control of open-system dynamics.</p>

            <p>We present a physics-informed classical-quantum machine learning framework for discriminating pristine CaF$_2$ from Er-doped CaF$_2$ using first-principles optical descriptors. Finite Ca$_8$F$_{16}$ and Ca$_7$ErF$_{16}$ clusters were constructed from the fluorite structure (a=5.46~$Å$) and treated using density functional theory (DFT) and linear-response time-dependent DFT (LR-TDDFT) within the GPAW code. Geometry optimization was performed in LCAO mode with a DZP basis and PBE exchange-correlation functional, followed by real-space finite-difference ground-state calculations with grid spacing h=0.30~$Å$ and N$_{bands}$=N$_{occ}$+20. Optical excitations up to 10~eV were obtained via the Casida formalism and converted into continuous absorption spectra using Gaussian broadening ($\sigma$=0.1-0.2~eV). From 1,589 energy-resolved points per system, physically interpretable descriptors including transition energy $E$, extinction coefficient $\kappa$, and absorption coefficient $\alpha$ were extracted. A classical RBF-kernel support vector machine (SVM) achieves a test accuracy (ACC) of 0.983 and ROC-AUC of 0.999. Quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) evaluated on statevector and noisy simulators reach accuracies of 0.851 and 0.817, respectively, while execution on IBM quantum hardware yields a test-slice accuracy of 0.733 under finite-shot and decoherence constraints. A hybrid quantum neural network (QNN) with a 3-qubit feature map and depth-4 ansatz achieves a test accuracy of 0.93 and AUC of 0.96. Results here demonstrate that dopant-induced optical fingerprints form a robust, physically grounded feature space for benchmarking near-term quantum learning models against strong classical baselines.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement-Dependent Error Bounds for Hamiltonian Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prateek P. Kulkarni</p>
            <p>We establish tight connections between entanglement entropy and the approximation error in Trotter-Suzuki product formulas for Hamiltonian simulation. Product formulas remain the workhorse of quantum simulation on near-term devices, yet standard error analyses yield worst-case bounds that can vastly overestimate the resources required for structured problems. For systems governed by geometrically local Hamiltonians with maximum entanglement entropy $S_\text{max}$ across all bipartitions, we prove that the first-order Trotter error scales as $\mathcal{O}(t^2 S_\text{max} \operatorname{polylog}(n)/r)$ rather than the worst-case $\mathcal{O}(t^2 n/r)$, where $n$ is the system size and $r$ is the number of Trotter steps. This yields improvements of $\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ for one-dimensional area-law systems and $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{3/2})$ for two-dimensional systems. We extend these bounds to higher-order Suzuki formulas, where the improvement factor involves $2^{pS^*/2}$ for the $p$-th order formula. We further establish a separation result demonstrating that volume-law entangled systems fundamentally require $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ more Trotter steps than area-law systems to achieve the same precision. This separation is tight up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis combines Lieb-Robinson bounds for locality, tensor network representations for entanglement structure, and novel commutator-entropy inequalities that bound the expectation value of nested commutators by the Schmidt rank of the state. These results have immediate applications to quantum chemistry, condensed matter simulation, and resource estimation for fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a promising quantum machine learning framework for near-term quantum platforms, yet the performance of different QRC architectures under realistic constraints remains largely unexplored. Here, we provide a comparative numerical study of single-step-QRC (SS-QRC) and multi-step-QRC (MS-QRC) architectures implemented on a Rydberg atom array. We demonstrate that while MS-QRC performance is highly sensitive to the underlying dynamical phase of matter and decoherence, SS-QRC exhibits greater robustness. Using the randomized measurement toolbox to mitigate measurement overhead, we reveal that sampling noise undermines the convergence property required for MS-QRC. This leads to a significant reduction in the information processing capacity (IPC) of MS-QRC, deteriorating its performance on nonlinear time-series benchmarks. In contrast, SS-QRC maintains high IPC and accuracy across both temporal and non-temporal tasks. Our results suggest SS-QRC as a preferred candidate for near-term practical applications due to its resilience to system configurations and statistical noise.</p>

This work investigates a Mach-Zehnder interferometer incorporating a Kerr nonlinear phase shifter, using photon-added two-mode squeezed coherent states generated via four-wave mixing as input. This study demonstrates that increasing both the photon-addition order and input resource strength systematically enhances phase sensitivity, quantum Fisher information, and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. The system not only surpasses the standard quantum limit but also approaches or exceeds the Heisenberg limit with linear phase shifts, while Kerr nonlinearity enables overcoming the super-Heisenberg limit. The proposed scheme exhibits enhanced robustness against photon loss, providing a promising approach for high-precision quantum metrology applications.</p>

            <h2>Noise Resilient 1SDIQKD for Practical Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Syed M Arslan, Muhammad T Rahim, Asad Ali, Hashir Kuniyil, Saif Al Kuwari</p>
            <p>One-sided device-independent quantum key distribution (1SDI-QKD) offers a practical middle ground between fully device-independent protocols and standard QKD, achieving security with detection efficiencies as low as 50.1\% on the untrusted side. However, prior analyses assumed idealized channels, neglecting realistic noise sources. We extend the 1SDI-QKD framework to include amplitude damping, dephasing, and depolarizing noise, quantifying their impact on secure key rates and efficiency requirements. Our results reveal a clear noise hierarchy: dephasing is most tolerable (secure keys achievable at 70\% efficiency with 30\% noise), while amplitude damping and depolarizing noise dramatically elevate requirements to over 90\%. Crucially, we find that security is lost while substantial entanglement remains (concurrence $C \approx 0.7$--$0.8$), demonstrating that steering violation, not merely entanglement, determines 1SDI-QKD security. To mitigate noise effects, we integrate the BBPSSW entanglement purification protocol, showing that 2--4 rounds can restore positive key rates in otherwise insecure regimes. Our resource overhead analysis reveals that effective key rates peak at moderate purification depths; excessive rounds become counterproductive. These findings establish practical boundaries for deploying 1SDI-QKD over metropolitan-scale quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits are a leading candidate for utility-scale quantum computing due to their fast gate speeds and steadily decreasing error rates. The requirement for millikelvin operating temperatures, however, creates a significant scaling bottleneck. Modular architectures using optical fiber links could bridge separate cryogenic nodes, but superconducting circuits do not have coherent optical transitions and microwave-to-optical conversion has not been shown for any non-classical photon state. In this work, we demonstrate the on-demand generation and tomographic reconstruction of itinerant single microwave photons at 8.9 GHz from a superconducting qubit. We upconvert this non-Gaussian state with a transducer added noise below 0.012 quanta and count the converted telecom photons at 193.4 THz with a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 5.1$\pm$1.1. We characterize the trade-offs between throughput and noise, and establish a viable path toward heralded entanglement distribution and gate teleportation. Looking ahead, these results empower existing superconducting devices to take a key role in distributed quantum technologies and heterogeneous quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Resilient Quantum Chemistry with Half the Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane McFarthing, Aidan Pellow-Jarman, Francesco Petruccione</p>
            <p>Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) offers a powerful route to accurate quantum chemistry on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices by combining quantum sampling with classical diagonalization. Here we introduce HSQD, a novel half-qubit SQD approach that halves the qubit requirement for simulating a chemical system and drastically reduces overall circuit depth and gate counts, suppressing hardware noise. When modeling the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule with a (10e, 26o) active space, HSQD matches the accuracy of SQD on IBM quantum hardware using only half the number of qubits and 40% fewer measurements. We further enhance HSQD with a heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) inspired selection of the samples, forming HCI-HSQD. This yields sub-millihartree accuracy across the N2 potential energy surface and produces subspaces up to 39% smaller than those from classical HCI, showing a significant improvement in the compactness of the ground-state representation. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of HCI-HSQD using iron-sulfur clusters, reaching active spaces of up to (54e, 36o) while using only half as many qubits as the original SQD. For these systems, HCI-HSQD reduces SQD energy errors by up to 76% for [2Fe-2S] and 26% for [4Fe-4S], while also reducing subspace sizes, halving measurement requirements, and eliminating expensive post-processing. Together, these results establish half-qubit SQD as a noise-resilient and resource-efficient pathway toward practical quantum advantage in strongly correlated chemistry.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian degeneracies of Lindblad generators (Liouvillian exceptional points) can induce non-exponential relaxation and higher-order poles in dynamical response functions. A collective spin coupled to a polarized Markovian bath exhibits an \emph{exceptional spectral phase} in which defective Liouvillian modes imprint super-Lorentzian features in frequency-resolved spectra. We compute the emission spectrum via the Liouvillian resolvent, identify symmetry-sector selection rules, and demonstrate that exceptional-point signatures are strongly state-dependent: they are suppressed in steady-state fluorescence yet become unambiguous for generic (infinite-temperature or random) initial states. Our results provide an experimentally accessible spectroscopic diagnostic of many-body Liouvillian exceptional phases and clarify when steady-state emission can (and cannot) reveal them.</p>

            <p>Computing electronic structures of quantum systems is a key task underpinning many applications in photonics, solid-state physics, and quantum technologies. This task is typically performed through iterative algorithms to find the energy eigenstates of a Hamiltonian, which are usually computationally expensive and suffer from convergence issues. In this work, we develop and implement the Quantum Jacobi-Davidson (QJD) method and its quantum diagonalization variant, the Sample-Based Quantum Jacobi-Davidson (SBQJD) method, and demonstrate their fast convergence for ground state energy estimation. We assess the intrinsic algorithmic performance of our methods through exact numerical simulations on a variety of quantum systems, including 8-qubit diagonally dominant matrices, 12-qubit one-dimensional Ising models, and a 10-qubit water molecule (H$_2$O) Hamiltonian. Our results show that both QJD and SBQJD achieve significantly faster convergence and require fewer Pauli measurements compared to the recently reported Quantum Davidson method, with SBQJD further benefiting from optimized reference state preparation. These findings establish the QJD framework as an efficient general-purpose subspace-based technique for solving quantum eigenvalue problems, providing a promising foundation for sparse Hamiltonian calculations on future fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Control to Minimize Dissipation and Fluctuations in Open Quantum Systems Beyond Slow and Rapid Regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Kurokawa, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Optimal control is a central problem in quantum thermodynamics. While control theories in the rapid-driving and slow-driving limits have been developed, to the best of our knowledge there is no general optimization method applicable to intermediate timescales. We introduce an optimal-control framework to minimize dissipated work and work variance, defined via the two-point measurement scheme, in open quantum systems governed by time-dependent Lindblad master equations. By introducing an auxiliary operator, we convert the history-dependent work variance into a time-local integral, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization beyond slow or rapid driving regimes. Applying our method, we find that in the coherent spin-boson model the optimized protocol can switch discontinuously between distinct locally optimal solutions as the relative weight between dissipation and fluctuations is varied. Moreover, for a single-level quantum dot coupled to a fermionic reservoir, the optimized fluctuation-minimizing protocol develops a qualitatively different multi-step structure that is not captured by approaches based on slow- or rapid-driving limits.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dissipative dynamics of a two-level atom in a weak gravitational field. Using the Feynman--Vernon influence functional formalism, we derive a quantum master equation describing the two-level atom interacting with a scalar field in a Newtonian gravitational field, and compute the energy dissipation rate of the atom. We find that the spontaneous emission rate (the dissipation rate in vacuum) is modified by the gravitational field. Specifically, this modification depends on the atom's dipole, the position of the atom relative to the source of the gravitational field, and the frequency of the scalar radiation emitted by the atom. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regimes in which the spontaneous emission rate is enhanced or suppressed by gravity. We also discuss how the modification arises from time dilation and dipole radiation in a weak gravitational field. These findings provide a theoretical basis for exploring gravitational effects in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Representation of Bosonic Matrix Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minhyeok Kang, Gwonhak Lee, Youngrong Lim, Joonsuk Huh</p>
            <p>Bosonic counting problems can be framed as estimation tasks of matrix functions such as the permanent, hafnian, and loop-hafnian, depending on the underlying bosonic network. Remarkably, the same functions also arise in spin models, including the Ising and Heisenberg models, where distinct interaction structures correspond to different matrix functions. This correspondence has been used to establish the classical hardness of simulating interacting spin systems by relating their output distributions to #P-hard quantities. Previous works, however, have largely been restricted to bipartite spin interactions, where transition amplitudes, which provide the leading-order contribution to the output probabilities, are proportional to the permanent. In this work, we extend the Ising model construction to arbitrary interaction networks and show that transition amplitudes of the Ising Hamiltonian are proportional to the hafnian and the loop-hafnian. The loop-hafnian generalizes both the permanent and hafnian, but unlike these cases, loop-hafnian-based states require Dicke-like superpositions, making the design of corresponding quantum circuits non-trivial. Our results establish a unified framework linking bosonic networks of single photons and Gaussian states with quantum spin dynamics and matrix functions. This unification not only broadens the theoretical foundation of quantum circuit models but also highlights new, diverse, and classically intractable applications.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points in non-Hermitian quantum systems give rise to novel genuine quantum phenomena. Recent explorations of exceptional-point-induced quantum phase transitions have extended from discrete-variable to continuous-variable-encoded quantum systems. However, quantum phase transitions driven by Liouvillian exceptional points (LEPs) in continuous-variable platforms remain largely unexplored. Here, we construct and investigate a Liouvillian exceptional structure based on a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit. Through numerical simulations, we reveal a quantum phase transition occurring at the LEP characterized by a sudden change in dynamical behavior from underdamped oscillations to overdamped relaxations as visualized via Wigner functions and Bloch sphere trajectories. Notably the negativity of the Wigner function serves as a direct signature of genuine quantum coherence unattainable in conventional single-qubit non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we introduce the phase difference between the off-diagonal elements of the Liouvillian eigenmatrices as a novel parameter to quantify the transition. Our results establish the Kerr-cat qubit as a novel continuous-variable setting for exploring dissipative quantum criticality and intrinsic non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <p>Quasiparticle tunneling events are a source of decoherence and correlated errors in superconducting circuits. Understanding and ultimately mitigating these errors calls for real-time detection of quasiparticle tunneling events on individual devices. In this work, we simultaneously detect quasiparticle tunneling events in two co-housed, charge-sensitive transmons coupled to a common waveguide. We measure background quasiparticle tunneling rates at the single-hertz level, with temporal resolution of tens of microseconds. Using time-tagged coincidence analysis, we show that individual events are uncorrelated across devices, whereas burst episodes occur about once per minute and are largely correlated. These bursts have a characteristic lifetime of 7 ms and induce a thousand-fold increase in the quasiparticle tunneling rate across both devices. In addition, we identify a rarer subset of bursts which are accompanied by a shift in the offset charge, at approximately one event per hour. Our results establish a practical and extensible method to identify quasiparticle bursts in superconducting circuits, as well as their correlations and spatial structure, advancing routes to suppress correlated errors in superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Symmetry underlies many of the most effective classical and quantum learning algorithms, yet whether quantum learners can gain a fundamental advantage under symmetry-imposed structures remains an open question. Based on evidence that classical statistical query ($\SQ$) frameworks have revealed exponential query complexity in learning symmetric function classes, we ask: can quantum learning algorithms exploit the problem symmetry better? In this work, we investigate the potential benefits of symmetry within the quantum statistical query ($\QSQ$) model, which is a natural quantum analog of classical $\SQ$. Our results uncover three distinct phenomena: (i) we obtain an exponential separation between $\QSQ$ and $\SQ$ on a permutation-invariant function class; (ii) we establish query complexity lower bounds for $\QSQ$ learning that match, up to constant factors, the corresponding classical $\SQ$ lower bounds for most commonly studied symmetries; however, the potential advantages may occur under highly skewed orbit distributions; and (iii) we further identify a tolerance-based separation exists, where quantum learners succeed at noise levels that render classical $\SQ$ algorithms ineffective. Together, these findings provide insight into when symmetry can enable quantum advantage in learning.</p>

            <p>An extension of standard quantum mechanics is proposed in which the Newtonian time parameter appearing in the unitary evolution operator is replaced with the time shown by a `quantum clock'. A quantum clock is defined by the following properties: (a) the time that the clock shows is non-decreasing, (b) the clock ticks at random with random tick sizes, and (c) on average the clock shows the Newtonian time. We show that the leading term in the evolution equation for the density matrix associated with any quantum clock model gives the von Neumann equation. Modifications to the von Neumann equation are worked out in detail in a parametric family of examples for which the tick sizes have a gamma distribution. The leading correction to the von Neumann equation is given by the Lindblad equation generated by the Hamiltonian, but there are higher-order terms that generalize the von Neumann equation and the Lindblad equation. Lower bounds on the parameters of these quantum clock models are derived by use of the precision limit of an atomic clock.</p>

            <p>In this work we develop a real-time Schwinger-Keldysh formulation of Krylov dynamics that treats Krylov complexity as an in-in observable generated by a closed time contour path integral. The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean. This formulation reorganises Krylov complexity into a dynamical field-theoretic framework and identifies new fluctuation diagnostics of operator growth in closed quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Digital quantum computing promises to offer computational capabilities beyond the reach of classical systems, yet its capabilities are often challenged by scarce quantum resources. A critical bottleneck in this context is how to load classical or quantum data into quantum circuits efficiently. Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this gap, here we reformulate most AQL methods into a unified framework and establish information-theoretic bounds on their approximation error. Our analysis reveals that the achievable infidelity between the prepared state and target state scales linearly with the total entanglement entropy across subsystems when the loading circuit is applied to the target state. In light of this, we develop AQER, a scalable AQL method that constructs the loading circuit by systematically reducing entanglement in target states. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AQER, using synthetic datasets, classical image and language datasets, and a quantum many-body state datasets with up to 50 qubits. The results show that AQER consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and gate efficiency.

Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities.

To this end, we use a fluctuation-regularized quantum master equation that predicts dipolar relaxation and drive-induced dissipation, in addition to the standard environmental dissipation channels. Importantly, this unified approach predicts the existence of optimal microwave drive amplitudes that maximize the OE and SE enhancements.

            <p>The paper solves the problem of continuum limit in bosonic thermal coherent-state path integrals. For this purpose, exact discrete versions of the path integral are constructed for three different orderings of the Hamiltonian: normal, anti-normal and symmetric (Weyl order). Subsequently, their different continuum versions are checked on the harmonic oscillator, to choose the symmetric ordering as a possibly correct choice for all Hamiltonians. Spotted mathematical subtleties in the simple case serve as a clue to the general solution. Finally, a general justification for the symmetric order is provided by deriving the continuum path integral starting from the exact discrete case by a renormalization procedure in the imaginary time frequency domain. While the role of Weyl order has already been found, the paper provides the missing proof of its suitability for every Hamiltonian and simplifies the previously established construction by referring only to creation and annihilation operators (without position and momentum operators).</p>

            <p>With increasing life expectancy, AD has become a major global health concern. While classical AI-based methods have been developed for early diagnosis and stage classification of AD, growing data volumes and limited computational resources necessitate faster, more efficient approaches. Quantum-based AI methods, which leverage superposition and entanglement principles along with high-dimensional Hilbert space, can surpass classical approaches' limitations and offer higher accuracy for high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy data. In this study, a Quantum-Based Parallel Model (QBPM) architecture is proposed for the efficient classification of AD stages using MRI datasets, inspired by the principles of classical model parallelism. The proposed model leverages quantum advantages by employing two distinct quantum circuits, each incorporating rotational and entanglement blocks, running in parallel on the same quantum simulator. The classification performance of the model was evaluated on two different datasets to assess its overall robustness and generalization capability. The proposed model demonstrated high classification accuracy across both datasets, highlighting its overall robustness and generalization capability. Results obtained under high-level Gaussian noise, simulating real-world conditions, further provided experimental evidence for the model's applicability not only in theoretical but also in practical scenarios. Moreover, compared with five different classical transfer learning methods, the proposed model demonstrated its efficiency as an alternative to classical approaches by achieving higher classification accuracy and comparable execution time while utilizing fewer circuit parameters. The results indicate that the proposed QBPM architecture represents an innovative and powerful approach for the classification of stages in complex diseases such as Alzheimer's.</p>

            <p>Compressing resource-intensive large language models by removing whole transformer blocks is a seemingly simple idea, but identifying which blocks to remove constitutes an exponentially difficult combinatorial problem. In this paper, we formulate block removal as a constrained binary optimization problem that can be mapped to a physical system (Ising model), whose energies are a strong proxy for downstream model performance. This formulation enables an efficient ranking of a large number of candidate block-removal configurations and yields many high-quality, non-trivial solutions beyond consecutive regions. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art block-removal methods across several benchmarks, with performance gains persisting after short retraining, and reaching improvements of up to 6 points on the MMLU benchmark. Our method requires only forward and backward passes for a few active parameters, together with an (at least approximate) Ising solver, and can be readily applied to any architecture. We illustrate this generality on the recent NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-FP8 model, which exhibits a highly inhomogeneous and challenging block structure.</p>

            <h2>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kirill Russkov</p>
            <p>The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian. The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Generator Kernels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Altmann, Maximilian Mansky, Maximilian Zorn, Jonas Stein, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</p>
            <p>Quantum kernel methods offer significant theoretical benefits by rendering classically inseparable features separable in quantum space. Yet, the practical application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), currently constrained by the limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, necessitates effective strategies to compress and embed large-scale real-world data like images into the constrained capacities of existing quantum devices or simulators. To this end, we propose Quantum Generator Kernels (QGKs), a generator-based approach to quantum kernels, comprising a set of Variational Generator Groups (VGGs) that merge universal generators into a parameterizable operator, ensuring scalable coverage of the available quantum space. Thereby, we address shortcomings of current leading strategies employing hybrid architectures, which might prevent exploiting quantum computing's full potential due to fixed intermediate embedding processes. To optimize the kernel alignment to the target domain, we train a weight vector to parameterize the projection of the VGGs in the current data context. Our empirical results demonstrate superior projection and classification capabilities of the QGK compared to state-of-the-art quantum and classical kernel approaches and show its potential to serve as a versatile framework for various QML applications.</p>

            <h2>L-entropy: A new genuine multipartite entanglement measure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaydeep Kumar Basak, Vinay Malvimat, Junggi Yoon</p>
            <p>We advance ``Latent entropy" (L-entropy) as a novel measure to characterize genuine multipartite entanglement in pure states, applicable to quantum systems with both finite and infinite degrees of freedom. This measure, derived from an upper bound on reflected entropy, attains its maximum for three-party GHZ states and $n=4,5$-party $2$-uniform states. We establish that it satisfies all essential properties of a genuine multipartite entanglement measure, including being a pure-state entanglement monotone. We further obtain an analogue of the Page curve by analyzing the behavior of L-entropy in multiboundary wormholes, emphasizing their connection to multipartite entanglement in random states. Specifically, for $n = 5$, we show that random states approximate $2$-uniform states, exhibiting maximal multipartite entanglement. Extending these ideas to finite temperatures, we introduce the Multipartite Thermal Pure Quantum (MTPQ) state, a generalization of the thermal pure quantum state to multipartite systems, and demonstrate that the entanglement structure in states of the multicopy SYK model exhibits finite-temperature $2$-uniform behavior.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic Zeroth-Order Mirror Descent via Vector Fields with A Posteriori Certification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahito Hayashi</p>
            <p>We develop a deterministic zeroth-order mirror descent framework by replacing gradients with a general vector field, yielding a vector-field-driven mirror update that preserves Bregman geometry while accommodating derivative-free oracles. Our analysis provides a unified evaluation template for last-iterate function values under a relative-smoothness-type inequality, with an emphasis on trajectory-wise (a posteriori) certification: whenever a verifiable inequality holds along the realized iterates, we obtain explicit last-iterate guarantees. The framework subsumes a broad class of information-geometric algorithms, including generalized Blahut-Arimoto-type updates, by expressing their dynamics through suitable choices of the vector field. We then instantiate the theory with deterministic central finite differences in moderate dimension, where constructing the vector field via deterministic central finite differences requires 2d off-center function values (and one reusable center value), i.e., 2d+1 evaluations in total, where d is the number of input real numbers. In this deterministic finite-difference setting, the key interface property is not classical convexity alone but a punctured-neighborhood generalized star-convexity condition that isolates an explicit resolution-dependent error floor. Establishing this property for the finite-difference vector field reduces to a robust conic dominance design problem; we give an explicit scaling rule ensuring the required uniform dominance on a circular cone. Together, these results expose a hidden geometric structure linking Bregman telescoping identities, deterministic certification, and robust conic geometry in zeroth-order mirror descent.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stafford Withington, Willem Jellema</p>
            <p>Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique for measuring the responsivities and complex-valued spatial polarimetric forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many-body system can absorb energy. It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise. We present, for the first time, an analysis of how noise propagates through an experiment resulting in errors and artefacts on spectral and modal plots. A noise model is essential, because it determines the signal to noise ratio needed to ensure a given level of experimental fidelity.</p>

            <h2>Tripartite quantum steering in Schwarzschild spacetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang-Wei Mi, Xiaofen Huang, Tinggui Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the effects of Hawking radiation on quantum steering and steering asymmetry in a tripartite system embedded in Schwarzschild spacetime. All tripartite steering types were classified,comprising three "1 to 2" and three "2 to 1" steering cases. Through a systematic analysis of all physically relevant scenarios (including accessible and inaccessible modes), we classify three canonical scenarios with one, two and three physically accessible modes. In the scenario of three physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation disrupts quantum steering, with the maximum steering asymmetry during the two-way steering to one-way steering transition precisely demarcating the phase boundary between these regimes. For two physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation exhibits dual behavior: enhancing the steering from Alice and Bob to anti-Charlie under certain parameters while suppressing it under others, while net strengthening other steering types. When considering one physically accessible mode, the Hawking effect of the black hole significantly enhances quantum steering. These findings provide new insights into quantum correlations in curved spacetime and establish observable signatures of Hawking effects in quantum steering phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Black Hole Interior and Quantum Error Correction with Dynamical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Miyata, Tomonori Ugajin</p>
            <p>According to the island formula, information in the code subspace defined in the black hole interior is embedded in the Hawking radiation after the Page time. At first sight, this embedding suggests that operations acting on the Hawking radiation could modify the information in the code subspace, potentially leading to an apparent violation of causality. Indeed, in previous studies based on the PSSY model, which incorporates only the topological degrees of freedom of gravity, it was shown that when the error is sufficiently large, a violation of causality can arise, as indicated by a nonvanishing mutual information. In this paper, we investigate the situation in which dynamical gravity also acts on the Hawking radiation. In this case, operations on the Hawking radiation induce nontrivial backreaction on the bulk spacetime appearing in the gravitational path integral for the mutual information -- an effect that is absent when the Hawking radiation is non-gravitating. We find that this backreaction renders the relevant mutual information vanishing. This result implies that, in theories with dynamical gravity, the apparent violation of causality is resolved.</p>

            <p>Self-accelerating Airy matter waves offer a clean setting to access the cubic Kennard phase. Here we reconstruct the relative phase of simulated Airy-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates in free space, a regime approached in microgravity, from interference fringes. The cubic phase dynamics are quantified via windowed polynomial fits with systematics-aware uncertainty estimates that account for window-induced correlations. We compare two experimentally feasible phase-extraction methods - heterodyne-based and density-based - and show that an Airy-Gaussian geometry yields substantially improved robustness to fit-window selection relative to an Airy-Airy collision. In the weakly interacting regime, the extracted cubic coefficient responds linearly to the effective one-dimensional interaction strength. Our approach turns cubic phase dynamics into a practical probe of weak mean-field nonlinearities in self-accelerating condensates.</p>

            <p>Spin relaxometry using solid-state spin defects, such as the diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, probes dynamical processes by measuring how environmental fluctuations enhance the spin relaxation rate. In the weak-coupling limit, relaxation rates sample the transverse magnetic-noise power spectral density through a sensor-specific filter function, turning the defect into a local, frequency-selective noise spectrometer. This review bridges theory and experiment, clarifying how measured relaxation rates map onto noise spectra and how near-field geometry shapes the response. We highlight representative applications across condensed-matter physics, chemical and biological sensing, and relaxometry-based magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. We conclude with emerging opportunities and key challenges.</p>

            <p>Long-range Rydberg molecules (LRMs) form when a highly excited Rydberg electron scatters from ground-state atoms inside its orbit, creating oscillatory, long-range potentials. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of caesium dimers correlated to 402P3/2 Rydberg states, with an emphasis on decay via autoionisation (associative ionisation). Our model includes a relativistic treatment of electron-atom scattering with spin-orbit coupling, the perturber's hyperfine structure, and coupling of vibrational levels to a continuum of short-range decay channels. Calculated potential-energy curves predict two families of wells: outer wells near the classical outer turning point supporting long-lived states, and inner wells at shorter range whose lifetimes are limited by tunneling and subsequent vibronic decay. Using photoassociation in an ultracold Cs gas and an analysis of pulsed-field-ionisation signals which are highly selective for the detection of molecules, we assign resonances by binding energy and measure lifetimes. The measured lifetimes of inner-well states increase systematically with increasing detuning and agree with calculated lifetimes; detection of Cs2+ product ions supports autoionisation as a dominant channel. We show that the lifetimes are strongly reduced by spin-orbit interactions in the transient Cs-collision complex, which lift the near-degeneracy in Omega observed for states in the outer well and control the inner-well binding. The identified states also provide promising pathways to create ultracold molecules in ion-pair states.</p>

            <h2>Position: The Need for Ultrafast Training</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duc Hoang</p>
            <p>Domain-specialized FPGAs have delivered unprecedented performance for low-latency inference across scientific and industrial workloads, yet nearly all existing accelerators assume static models trained offline, relegating learning and adaptation to slower CPUs or GPUs. This separation fundamentally limits systems that must operate in non-stationary, high-frequency environments, where model updates must occur at the timescale of the underlying physics. In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments. Enabling such regimes requires rethinking algorithms, architectures, and toolflows jointly, but promises to transform FPGAs from static inference engines into real-time learning machines.</p>

            <p>Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses.</p>

            <p>A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</p>

The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schrödinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. The Bell-cat states are visualized by plotting their Wigner function and we explore their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix. We also explain the essential topological difference between identical spins and the excitations of a bosonic mode.</p>

            <p>Accurate noise characterization is essential for reliable quantum computation. Effective Pauli noise models have emerged as powerful tools, offering detailed description of the error processes with a manageable number of parameters, which guarantees the scalability of the characterization procedure. However, a fundamental limitation in the learnability of Pauli fidelities impedes full high-accuracy characterization of both general and effective Pauli noise, thereby restricting e.g., the performance of noise-aware error mitigation techniques. We introduce Multi-Layer Cycle Benchmarking (MLCB), an enhanced characterization protocol that improves the learnability associated with effective Pauli noise models by jointly analyzing multiple layers of Clifford gates. We show a simple experimental implementation and demonstrate that, in realistic scenarios, MLCB can reduce unlearnable noise degrees of freedom by up to $75\%$, improving the accuracy of sparse Pauli-Lindblad noise models and boosting the performance of error mitigation techniques like probabilistic error cancellation. Our results highlight MLCB as a scalable, practical tool for precise noise characterization and improved quantum computation.</p>

            <p>A focus of recent research in quantum computing has been on developing quantum algorithms for differential equations solving using variational methods on near-term quantum devices. A promising approach involves variational algorithms, which combine classical Runge-Kutta methods with quantum computations. However, a rigorous error analysis, essential for assessing real-world feasibility, has so far been lacking. In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of error sources and determine the resource requirements needed to achieve specific target errors. In particular, we derive analytical error and resource estimates for scenarios with and without shot noise, examining shot noise in quantum measurements and truncation errors in Runge-Kutta methods. Our analysis does not take into account representation errors and hardware noise, as these are specific to the instance and the used device. We evaluate the implications of our results by applying them to two scenarios: classically solving a $1$D ordinary differential equation and solving an option pricing linear partial differential equation with the variational algorithm, showing that the most resource-efficient methods are of order 4 and 2, respectively. This work provides a framework for optimizing quantum resources when applying Runge-Kutta methods, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy in both solving differential equations and simulating quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum burst error correction codes (QBECCs) are of great importance to deal with the memory effect in quantum channels. As the most important family of QBECCs, quantum cyclic codes (QCCs) play a vital role in the correction of burst errors. In this work, we characterize the burst error correction ability of QCCs constructed from the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and the Hermitian constructions. We determine the burst error correction limit of QCCs and quantum Reed-Solomon codes with algorithms in polynomial-time complexities. As a result, lots of QBECCs saturating the quantum Reiger bound are obtained. We show that quantum Reed-Solomon codes have better burst error correction abilities than the previous results. At last, we give the quantum error-trapping decoder (QETD) of QCCs for decoding burst errors. The decoder runs in linear time and can decode both degenerate and nondegenerate burst errors. What's more, the numerical results show that QETD can decode much more degenerate burst errors than the nondegenerate ones.</p>

            <p>Time crystals are a peculiar state of matter. Their emergence hinges on ergodicity breaking, which typically originates from many-body localization or Floquet prethermalization. Here we propose a novel scheme for devising robust dissipative time crystals where the ergodicity is broken through symmetry-induced fragmentation. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we first propose a generic Liouvillian with long-time oscillations typical of time crystals. We then show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. Intriguingly, the stage-wise prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model -- as the excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group, the branching rules of the permutation group ensure the robustness of the prethermal time crystal. Our work paves the way for devising time crystals through Hilbert-space fragmentation. It also sheds light on the dynamic effects of non-Hermitian physics in many-body quantum open systems.</p>

            <p>A classical state-preparation device cannot generate states in relative superposition. We introduce classical models in which devices that are individually unable to generate states with relative superposition can be stochastically coordinated to simulate sets of quantum states. These models have natural operational interpretation in prepare-and-measure scenarios and they can account for many non-commuting quantum state sets. We develop systematic methods both for classically simulating quantum sets and for showing that no such simulation exists, thereby certifying quantum coherence. In particular, we determine the exact noise rates required to classically simulate the entire state space of quantum theory. We also reveal connections between the operational classicality of sets and the well-known fundamental concepts of joint measurability and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Here, we present an avenue to understand how and to what extent quantum states defy generic models based on classical devices, which also has relevant implications for quantum information applications.</p>

            <p>Open Quantum Brownian Motion (OQBM) is a new class of quantum Brownian motion in which the dynamics of the Brownian particle depend not only on interactions with a thermal environment but also on the state of its internal degrees of freedom. For an Ohmic bath spectral density with a Lorentz-Drude cutoff frequency at a high-temperature limit, we derive the Born-Markov master equation for the reduced density matrix of an open Brownian particle in a harmonic potential. The resulting master equation is written in phase-space representation using the Wigner function, and due to the separation of associated timescales in the high-damping limit, we perform adiabatic elimination of the momentum variable to obtain OQBM. We numerically solve the derived master equation for the reduced density matrix of the OQBM for Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial distributions. In each case, the OQBM dynamics converge to several Gaussian distributions. To gain physical insight into the studied system, we also plotted the dynamics of the off-diagonal element of the open quantum Brownian particle and found damped coherent oscillations. Finally, we investigated the time-dependent variance in the position of the OQBM walker and observed a transition between ballistic and diffusive behavior.</p>

            <p>We introduce the graph composition framework, a generalization of the $st$-connectivity framework for constructing quantum algorithms. Our framework constructs algorithms that solve a connectivity problem on an undirected graph, where the availability of each edge is computed by a span program. The key novelty of our framework is that the construction allows for amortization of the span programs' costs, while at the same time avoiding build-up of errors due to composition. We give generic time-efficient implementations of algorithms generated through the graph composition framework in the quantum read-only memory model, which is a weaker assumption than the more common quantum random-access model. Along the way, we also simplify the span program algorithm by converting it to a transducer, and remove the dependence of its analysis on the effective spectral gap lemma. We use graph composition to unify existing quantum algorithmic frameworks. Surprisingly, we show that any randomized algorithm can be converted into an instance of the $st$-connectivity framework. Furthermore, we show that the $st$-connectivity framework subsumes the learning graph framework, and the weighted-decision-tree framework. We show that the graph composition framework subsumes part of the quantum divide-and-conquer framework, and that it is itself subsumed by the multidimensional quantum walk framework. Moreover, we show polynomial relations and separations between the optimal query complexities that can be achieved with several of these frameworks. Finally, we apply our techniques to give improved algorithms for various string-search problems.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Simultaneous Quantum-Classical Communications Under Composable Security</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Zaunders, Ziqing Wang, Robert Malaney, Ryan Aguinaldo, Timothy C. Ralph</p>
            <p>Simultaneous quantum-classical communications (SQCC) protocols are a family of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols which allow for quantum and classical symbols to be integrated concurrently on the same optical pulse and mode. In this work, we present a revised analysis of simultaneous quantum-classical communications in Gaussian-modulated coherent-state CV-QKD protocols. We address security concerns inherently associated with SQCC schemes and provide an updated model of the coupling between the classical and quantum channels. We provide evidence for our model via Monte Carlo simulation. We compute the performance of our revised SQCC protocol in terms of the secret-key generation rate optimised over free parameters and demonstrate improved quantum efficiency for a given classical bit-error rate. Lastly, we extend our analysis into the finite-key regime, where we propose a scheme for composably-secure SQCC under realistic operating conditions and demonstrate that our scheme retains the advantage in quantum performance over previous models.</p>

            <h2>Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debabrata Mondal, Lea F. Santos, S. Sinha</p>
            <p>Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</p>

            <h2>Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin-Bin Mao, Zhe Wang, Bin-Bin Chen, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</p>

            <p>Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-Lambda{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritam Roy, Subhankar Bera, A. S. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We study the security of a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol under the one-sided device-independent (1sDI) setting, which assumes trust in only one party's measurement device. This approach effectively provides a balance between the experimental viability of device-dependent (DD-QKD) and the minimal trust assumptions of device-independent (DI-QKD). An analytical lower bound on the asymptotic key rate is derived to provide security against collective attacks, in which the eavesdropper's information is limited only by the function of observed violation of a linear quantum steering inequality, specifically the three-setting Cavalcanti-Jones-Wiseman-Reid (CJWR) inequality. We provide a closed-form key rate formula by reducing the security analysis to mixtures of Bell-diagonal states by utilizing symmetries of the steering functional. We show that the protocol tolerates higher quantum bit error rates (QBER) than present DI-QKD protocols by benchmarking its performance under depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we explore the impact of detection inefficiencies and show that, in contrast to DI-QKD, which requires near-perfect detection, secure key generation can be achieved even with lower detection efficiency on the untrusted side. These findings highlight the advantages of 1sDI-QKD as a steering-based alternative for secure quantum communication and provide insights relevant for near-future experimental implementations.</p>

            <h2>Parrondo paradox in quantum image encryption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Łukasz Pawela</p>
            <p>We present a quantum image encryption protocol that harnesses discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on cycles and explicitly examines the role of the Parrondo paradox in security. Using the NEQR representation, a DTQW-generated probability mask is transformed into a quantum key image and applied via CNOT to encrypt grayscale images. We adopt an efficient circuit realization of DTQWs based on QFT-diagonalization and coin-conditioned phase layers, yielding low depth for \(N=2^n\) positions and \(t\) steps. On \(64\times 64\) benchmark images, the scheme suppresses adjacent-pixel correlations to near zero after encryption (e.g., \(|C_H|, |C_V|, |C_D| \approx 10^{-2}\)), produces nearly uniform histograms, and achieves high ciphertext entropy close to the 8-bit ideal. Differential analyses further indicate strong diffusion and confusion: NPCR exceeds \(99\%\) and UACI is around \(30\%\), consistent with robust sensitivity to small plaintext changes. Crucially, we investigate the impact of the Parrondo paradox on encryption quality and demonstrate that our fully unitary protocol remains robust even in paradoxical regimes. We show that while the paradox can introduce biases in simpler measurement-based schemes, our integrated approach which incorporates spatial diffusion and position-color entanglement, effectively leverages the complex interference patterns of the Parrondo walk to enhance substitution, maintaining high entropy and low correlations. Our results provide a performant DTQW-based quantum image cipher and confirm the suitability of paradoxical dynamics for secure quantum image processing. We discuss implications for hardware implementations and extensions to higher-dimensional walks.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Structure Certification Based on Energy-Restricted State Discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carles Roch I Carceller</p>
            <p>The certification of entanglement in multipartite scenarios is crucial for the advancement of quantum technologies, particularly for the realization of large-scale quantum networks. Here, we introduce a method to certify the structure of the entanglement in ensembles of quantum states with limited energy based on a state discrimination game played by multiple distant and uncharacterized parties. The optimal success probability of this game forms a strict hierarchy, determined by the number of bipartitions and the size of the entangled subsets in each state of the underlying ensemble. The game can be optimally won using a single, fixed measurement setting shared by all parties, regardless of the specific entanglement structure. We further demonstrate that both the performance and noise robustness of our method improve in the multipartite regime, scaling exponentially with the number of parties. Consequently, our approach enables the exclusion of entire structural classes, thereby certifying the structure of multipartite entanglement.</p>

            <p>A quantum error correcting code protects encoded logical information against errors. Transversal gates are a naturally fault-tolerant way to manipulate logical qubits but cannot be universal themselves. Protocols such as magic state distillation are needed to achieve universality via measurements and postselection. A phase is a region of parameter space with smoothly varying large-scale statistical properties except at its boundaries. Here, we find a phase of continuously tunable logical unitaries for the surface code implemented by transversal operations and decoding that is robust against dephasing errors. The logical unitaries in this phase have an infidelity that is exponentially suppressed in the code distance compared to their rotation angles. We exploit this to design a simple fault-tolerant protocol for continuous-angle logical rotations. This lowers the overhead for applications requiring many small-angle rotations such as quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement distribution via satellite: an evaluation of competing protocols assuming realistic free-space optical channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Zaunders, Timothy C. Ralph</p>
            <p>A key technical requirement of any future quantum network is the ability to distribute quantum-entangled resources between two spatially separated points at a high rate and high fidelity. Entanglement distribution protocols based on satellite platforms, which transmit and receive quantum resources directly via free-space optical propagation, are therefore excellent candidates for quantum networking, since the geometry and loss characteristics of satellite networks feasibly allow for up to continental-scale ($\sim10^3$ km) over-the-horizon communication without the infrastructure, cost, or losses associated with equivalent fibre-optic networks. In this work, we explore two network topologies commonly associated with quantum networks - entanglement distribution between two satellites in low-Earth orbit mediated by a third satellite and entanglement distribution between two ground stations mediated by a satellite in low-Earth orbit, and two entanglement distribution schemes - one where the central satellite is used as a relay, and the other where the central satellite is used to generate and distribute the entangled resource directly. We compute a bound on the rate of distribution of distillable entanglement achieved by each protocol in each network topology as a function of the network channels for both single-rail discrete- (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) resources and use or non-use of probabilistic noiseless linear quantum amplification (NLA). In the case of atmospheric channels we take into account the turbulent and optical properties of the free-space propagation. We determine that for the triple-satellite network configuration, the optimal strategy is to perform a distributed NLA scheme in either CV or DV, and for the ground-satellite-ground network the optimal strategy is to distribute a DV resource via the central satellite.</p>

            <h2>A New Quantum Linear System Algorithm Beyond the Condition Number and Its Application to Solving Multivariate Polynomial Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianqiang Li</p>
            <p>Given a matrix $A$ of dimension $M \times N$ and a vector $\vec{b}$, the quantum linear system (QLS) problem asks for the preparation of a quantum state $|\vec{y}\rangle$ proportional to the solution of $A\vec{y} = \vec{b}$. Existing QLS algorithms have runtimes that scale linearly with the condition number $\kappa(A)$, the sparsity of $A$, and logarithmically with inverse precision, but often overlook structural properties of $\vec{b}$, whose alignment with $A$'s eigenspaces can greatly affect performance. In this work, we present a new QLS algorithm that explicitly leverages the structure of the right-hand side vector $\vec{b}$. The runtime of our algorithm depends polynomially on the sparsity of the augmented matrix $H = [A, -\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter \[ ET= \sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2 \cdot d_i, \] where $\vec{p} = (AA^{\top})^+ \vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the squared $\ell_2$ norm of the $i$-th row of $H$. We also introduce a structure-aware rescaling technique tailored to the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$. Unlike left preconditioning methods, which transform the linear system to $DA\vec{y} = D\vec{b}$, our approach applies a right rescaling matrix, reformulating the linear system as $AD\vec{z} = \vec{b}$. As an application of our instance-aware QLS algorithm and new rescaling scheme, we develop a quantum algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial systems in regimes where prior QLS-based methods fail. This yields an end-to-end framework applicable to a broad class of problems. In particular, we apply it to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, formulated as a special case of a polynomial system, and show through detailed analysis that, under certain conditions, our quantum algorithm for MIS runs in polynomial time.</p>

Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimal sensitivity can be achieved by combining projective momentum measurements with a time-dependent adjustment of the squeezing phase. Our results highlight the fundamental role of phase-engineered squeezing in quantum gravimetry protocols and provide new insights into the design of optimized sensing strategies.</p>

To do so, we introduce a primitive notion of splitting maps within dagger symmetric monoidal categories. Splitting maps give rise to subsystems that admit comparison via a preorder called comprehension, and support an adaptation of the usual categorical trace. We show that the comprehension preorder precisely captures the inclusion partial order between von Neumann algebras, and that the splitting map trace captures the natural notion of von Neumann algebra trace. As a consequence of the development of these diagrammatic tools, we prove that the known equivalence between semi-causality and semi-localisability for factor subsystems extends to all (including non-factor) subsystems.</p>

            <h2>Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ievgen I. Arkhipov</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting uniquely defined Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikodem Popławski</p>
            <p>The conservation law for the orbital plus spin angular momentum of a free Dirac particle in curved spacetime requires that the affine connection has the antisymmetric part: the torsion tensor, which extends general relativity to the Einstein$-$Cartan theory of gravity. In the presence of torsion, the Dirac equation becomes a nonlinear, cubic equation in the spinor wave function. We show that the energy eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian as functions of the momentum are different for the fermion and antifermion components of the spinor, violating charge conjugation symmetry, and also depend on the helicity. Consequently, particles of matter and antimatter have different dispersion relations and therefore different masses. This mass difference increases with density and becomes significant near the Cartan density, which existed in the early Universe. Because antimatter particles were more massive than matter particles, they were also slower during pair production in the early Universe and therefore had higher cross sections for gravitational capture by primordial black holes. This difference might have led to the matter$-$antimatter imbalance in the observable Universe.</p>

            <p>The Lanczos algorithm offers a framework for constructing wave functions in closed and open quantum systems from their Hamiltonians. Since the early universe is inherently an open system, we employ this algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across various cosmological phases: inflation, radiation domination (RD), and matter domination (MD). Our results highlight a clear distinction in Krylov complexity between the closed- and open-system methodologies. To accurately capture the influence of potentials during RD and MD, we examine a set of inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, $R^2$ inflation, and chaotic inflation, while incorporating violations of slow-roll conditions. This study is conducted in conformal time through the preheating stage. Numerically, we find that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy shows remarkable similarity across different potentials during RD and MD. Furthermore, we rigorously construct an open two-mode squeezed state using the second kind of Meixner polynomial. Based on this construction, we derive for the first time the evolution equations for the squeezing parameter $r_k$ and phase $\phi_k$ in terms of the scale factor. Our analysis indicates that dissipative effects lead to rapid decoherence-like behavior. In addition, we observe that the inflationary universe behaves as a strongly dissipative system, whereas during the RD and MD epochs the universe exhibits weak dissipative characteristics. This work opens new perspectives for studying the universe from a quantum-informational viewpoint.</p>

We further derive a simple algebraic relation between the numbers of these excitations expressed in terms of hybridization between the single-particle wavefunctions and linear dissipative fields. Based on these findings, we propose a practical recipes how to stabilize degenerate steady states in topological superconductors through controlled dissipation engineering.

            <h2>Neutrino backgrounds in matter-wave interferometry: implications for dark matter searches and beyond-Standard Model physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João Paulo Pinheiro</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of neutrino-induced decoherence in macroscopic matter-wave interferometry experiments designed to search for dark matter and beyond-Standard Model physics. Our calculation includes contributions from the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), solar neutrinos, and reactor antineutrinos, accounting for coherent scattering processes across nuclear, atomic, and macroscopic length scales. Within the Standard Model, we find negligible decoherence rates for planned experiments such as MAQRO ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-27}$) and terrestrial interferometers like Pino ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-22}$). However, these experiments achieve competitive sensitivity to beyond-Standard Model physics through light vector mediator interactions, with C$\nu$B constraining coupling products to $g_\nu g_n \lesssim 10^{-17}$ for $Z'$ masses below 1 eV. Our results provide a theoretical framework for interpreting matter-wave interferometry measurements in terms of neutrino interaction physics and for deriving constraints on BSM models from experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Quantum Monte Carlo Method for Polariton Chemistry via Mixed Block Sparsity and Tensor Hypercontraction Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Zhang</p>
            <p>We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.</p>

            <p>We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pawel Caputa, Abhigyan Saha, Piotr Sułkowski</p>
            <p>We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on the Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) in its left-, right-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under the corresponding class of diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behaviour under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other well-known setups, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</p>

Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.</p>

Recent advancements in integrated quantum photonics, especially in silicon-based and lithium niobate platforms, are pushing the technology toward greater scalability and functionality. Silicon circuits have progressed from centimeter-scale, dual-photon systems to millimeter-scale, high-density devices that integrate thousands of components, enabling sophisticated programmable manipulation of multi-photon states. Meanwhile, lithium niobate, thanks to its wide optical transmission window, outstanding nonlinear and electro-optic coefficients, and chemical stability, has emerged as an optimal substrate for fully integrated photonic quantum chips. Devices made from this material exhibit high efficiency in in generating, manipulating, converting, storing, and detecting photon states, thereby establishing a basis for deterministic multi-photon generation and single-photon quantum interactions, as well as comprehensive frequency-state control. This review explores the development of integrated photonic quantum technologies based on both silicon and lithium niobate, highlighting invaluable insights gained from silicon-based systems that can assist the scaling of lithium niobate technologies. It examines the functional integration mechanisms of lithium niobate in electro-optic tuning and nonlinear energy conversion, showcasing its transformative impact throughout the photonic quantum computing process.

            <p>Extending the high-harmonic cutoff with experimentally accessible fields is essential for advancing tabletop coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray sources. Although terahertz (THz) assistance offers a promising route, cutoff extension at weak, laboratory-accessible THz strengths remain poorly understood. In this report, we comprehensively investigate THz-assisted high-order harmonic generation (HHG) using time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations supported by classical trajectory analysis and Bohmian-based quantum dynamics. By mapping the plateau evolution versus THz strength, we show that even weak THz fields can extend the cutoff, producing a pronounced ``fish-fin'' structure whose prominent rays saturate near $I_p + 8 U_p$. We trace this extension to long electron excursions spanning several optical cycles before recombination, and provide a fully consistent explanation using both classical analysis and Bohmian trajectories flow. Our findings reveal that this cutoff-extension mechanism is remarkably robust, persisting across different atomic species and remaining insensitive to variations in the driving parameters. These results demonstrate that cutoff control is achievable with laboratory-scale THz fields, offering practical guidelines for engineering coherent high-energy HHG, and providing a robust pathway for tracking ultrafast electron motion in real time.</p>

            <h2>The Photonic Foundation of Temperature: Mechanisms of Thermal Equilibrium and Entropy Production</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Vaknin</p>
            <p>I examine the physical foundations of temperature and thermal equilibrium by identifying photons as the fundamental agents that establish and maintain the characteristic energy scale $E_c = k_B T$ in ordinary matter. While classical thermodynamics successfully describes equilibrium phenomenologically, the realization of thermal distributions requires concrete microscopic mechanisms provided by quantum electrodynamics. We derive the Boltzmann distribution from a minimal differential scaling postulate and show that sustaining thermal equilibrium demands continuous photon exchange with average energy $\langle h\nu \rangle = 2.701\,E_c$, quantifying the energetic throughput necessary to counter radiative losses. Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths. This photonic framework complements phenomenological thermodynamics by providing its microscopic foundation and clarifies the physical meaning of temperature as an emergent collective property of photon-mediated energy exchange.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing leverages quantum resources to surpass the standard quantum limit, yet many existing protocols rely on the preparation of complex entangled states and Hamiltonian engineering, posing challenges for universality and scalability. Here, we report an experimental realization of a universal protocol, known as Butterfly Metrology, proposed in [arXiv:2411.12794], demonstrating a scrambling-based approach for quantum-enhanced sensing on a superconducting quantum processor. By exploiting many-body information scrambling, we observe quantum-enhanced sensitivity to an encoded phase beyond the standard quantum limit, with a scaling consistent with a factor-of-two of the Heisenberg limit for system sizes of up to 10 qubits. Importantly, we experimentally establish a connection between the enhanced sensitivity and the dynamics of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), and show that the buildup of scrambling-induced genuine multipartite entanglement underlies the observed sensitivity enhancement. Our results demonstrate a scalable and practical approach for quantum-enhanced sensing in interacting many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qihang Ye, Qihang Ye, Bing Miao, Lei Ying</p>
            <p>Conventionally, dispersion forces mediated by quantum vacuum fluctuations are known to exhibit universal distance scalings, with retardation typically leading to a faster decay of the interaction. Here, we show that this expectation fails for intrinsically discrete systems. Using the microscopic scattering approach, we study the Casimir-Polder interaction between two atomic arrays, and uncover an unconventional distance scaling in which the force crosses over from a faster decay at short separations to a slower decay in the retarded regime. This behavior originates from the discrete lattice structure and can be consistently understood within the scattering picture. Extending our analysis to Rydberg atomic arrays, we predict an even stronger deviation from conventional scaling and propose an experimentally feasible scheme for direct measurement. Our results provide a new platform for exploring dispersion forces beyond the continuum limit.</p>

By appropriately tuning the frequency of a pair of lasers, a two-photon transition is continually driven to an atomic excited state that emits photons at the desired wavelength. We show that resonantly coupling a cavity mode to the telecom transition can enhance the rate of emission while retaining the antibunched counting statistics that are characteristic of atomic light sources. We also explore coupling a second, independent cavity mode to the atom, which increases the telecom emission rate and introduces quantum correlations between the cavity modes. A model for the hyperfine structure of a single cesium atom is then described and numerically integrated to demonstrate the viability of implementing the scheme with a modern cavity QED system.</p>

            <p>Phase sensing with entangled multiqubit states in the presence of noise is a central theme of modern quantum metrology. The present work investigates Dicke state superposition probes for quantum phase sensing under parameter encoding generated by one- and two-body interaction Hamiltonians. A class of N-qubit Dicke superposition states that exhibit near-Heisenberg scaling, of the quantum Fisher information, while maintaining significantly enhanced robustness to dephasing noise compared to GHZ, W-superposition, and balanced Dicke states, under unitary encodings generated by one-body interaction Hamiltonians are identified. For two-body interactions, Dicke superposition probes optimizing the quantum Fisher information are identified, and their performance under phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and global depolarizing noise is explored. Within this family, certain Dicke superpositions are found to combine super-Heisenberg scaling with improved resilience to phase damping relative to Fisher information optimal probes. These results establish tailored near-optimal Dicke-state superposition probes as versatile and noise-resilient resources for Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg quantum phase sensing governed by one- and two-body interactions.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a versatile and efficient multiparameter quantum sensing protocol, which simultaneously estimates many non-commuting and time-dependent signals that are coherently or incoherently coupled to sensing particles. Even in the presence of control imperfections and readout errors, our approach can detect exponentially many parameters in the system size while maintaining the optimal scaling of sensitivity. To accomplish this, scrambling dynamics are leveraged to map distinct signals to unique patterns of bitstring measurements, which distinguishes a large number of signals without significant sensitivity loss. Based on this principle, we develop a computationally efficient protocol utilizing random global Clifford unitaries and evaluate its performance both analytically and numerically. Our protocol naturally extends to scrambling dynamics generated by random local Clifford circuits, local random unitary circuits (RUCs), and ergodic Hamiltonian evolution--commonly realized in near-term quantum hardware--and opens the door to applications ranging from precise noise benchmarking of quantum dynamics to learning time-dependent Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting emerging experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regimes. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how the interaction of the entangled photon pair with the polariton/bipolariton modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We suggest that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity state. Our approach is not only robust to various regimes of cavity-exciton coupling, but also amenable to extensions beyond the Tavis-Cummings model, enabling the representation of a broad class of molecular systems and solid state quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>An Ontological Interpretation of Photon Wave-Particle Duality via Complex-Space Trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiang-Yi Han, Ciann-Dong Yang</p>
            <p>Wave particle duality remains a central interpretational challenge in quantum theory. In this work, we develop a trajectory-based description of photon dynamics formulated in an extended complex space within the relativistic quantum Hamilton Jacobi framework. In this approach, photon motion is represented by complex trajectories whose real projections describe propagation, while imaginary components encode oscillatory structure. We show that momentum eigenstates correspond to straight line trajectories with uniform propagation at the speed of light, whereas superposition states lead to nontrivial quantum potentials and oscillatory motion in the complex plane. Extending the analysis to complex two dimensional space reveals richer dynamical behavior, including propagating wave like trajectories and standing wave like patterns in real projections. Energy momentum consistency is verified through an internal coherence analysis based on projected standing wave wavelengths. Rather than introducing new dynamical laws or additional physical dimensions, the complex space is employed as an interpretational framework that renders wave like and particle like aspects as complementary projections of a single underlying motion. The results suggest a unified geometric perspective on wave particle duality, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>Subwavelength arrays of atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezers are inherently susceptible to deformations: Optomechanical forces produce lattice distortions, which, in turn, modify the optical response of the array. We show that this coupling hybridizes collective atomic excitations (polaritons) with phonons, forming polaron-polaritons -- the fundamental quasiparticles governing light-matter interactions in arrays of trapped atoms. Using analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations, we show that: (1) phonons can strongly enhance the decay of subradiant states, but also enable their efficient excitation; (2) transport of dark excitations remains remarkably robust even at low trap frequencies, except when a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons; and (3) motion reduces the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, however, we identify mechanisms that mitigate this degradation and restore reflectivity above 99% in some cases. Our findings lay the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to harness them in state-of-the-art experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Eyles, Emmanuel Lassalle, Adam Stokes, Ramón Paniagua-Domínguez, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon in which coherence between emitters results in enhanced and directional radiative emission. Many quantum optical phenomena can be characterized by the two-time quantum correlation function $g^{(2)}(t,\tau)$, which describes the photon statistics of emitted radiation. However, the critical task of determining $g^{(2)}(t,\tau)$ becomes intractable for large emitter ensembles due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of emitters. Here, we analyse and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods applicable to emitter arrays embedded within electromagnetic environments, which generally provide upper and lower bounds for $g^{(2)}(t,0)$. We also introduce corrections to these methods (termed offset corrections) that significantly improve the quality of the predictions. The optimal choice of method depends on the total number of emitters, such that taken together, the two approaches provide accurate descriptions across a broad range of important regimes. This work therefore provides new theoretical tools for studying the well-known yet complex phenomenon of superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters.</p>

            <p>Collective light emission from many-body quantum systems is a cornerstone of quantum optics, yet its implementation in solid-state platforms operating under ambient conditions remains highly challenging. Large-bandgap van der Waals materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) host stable room-temperature single-photon emitters with narrow linewidths across a broad spectral range. However, cooperative radiative effects in this system have not been previously explored. Here we demonstrate collective emission from quantum-emitter ensembles in hBN layers when the emitters are nearly indistinguishable and positioned within a sub-wavelength proximity. Using confocal microscopy and a Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) configuration, we identify both isolated emitters and ensembles activated by localized electron-beam irradiation. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a superlinear intensity enhancement and a pronounced acceleration of the radiative decay in tightly confined ensembles, with lifetimes approaching the temporal resolution of our experimental system (about 500 ps), compared to approximately 1.85 ns for single emitters or large, spatially extended ensembles. Complementary second-order photon-correlation measurements exhibit sub-Poissonian antidip consistent with emission from a few indistinguishable emitters. The simultaneous observation of lifetime shortening and enhanced emission provides direct evidence of cooperative emission at room temperature, achieved without optical cavities or cryogenic cooling. These results establish optically active defect ensembles in hBN as a scalable solid-state platform for engineered collective quantum optics in two-dimensional materials, opening avenues toward ultrabright superradiant light sources and nonclassical photonic states for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Doi, Liang Li, Ung Nguyen, Tadashi Takayanagi</p>
            <p>We study how energy and quantum entanglement are transferred when two identical CFTs are entangled locally. This is probed by considering a local operator insertion in one of the CFTs. When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation. We also find that this leads to a phenomenon opposite to scrambling, where mutual information, instead of being suppressed, gets enhanced by the insertion of a local operator excitation.</p>

            <h2>Non-invertible translation from Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Oishi, Takuma Saito, Hiromi Ebisu</p>
            <p>Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Quotient geometry of tensor ring decomposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Gao, Renfeng Peng, Ya-xiang Yuan</p>
            <p>Differential geometries derived from tensor decompositions have been extensively studied and provided the foundations for a variety of efficient numerical methods. Despite the practical success of the tensor ring (TR) decomposition, its intrinsic geometry remains less understood, primarily due to the underlying ring structure and the resulting nontrivial gauge invariance. We establish the quotient geometry of TR decomposition by imposing full-rank conditions on all unfolding matrices of the core tensors and capturing the gauge invariance. Additionally, the results can be extended to the uniform TR decomposition, where all core tensors are identical. Numerical experiments validate the developed geometries via tensor ring completion tasks.</p>

            <h2>Bound-state-free Förster resonant shielding of strongly dipolar ultracold molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reuben R. W. Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a method to suppress collisional loss in strongly dipolar, rotationally excited ultracold molecules using a combination of static (dc) and microwave (ac) electric fields. By tuning two excited pair molecular rotational states into a Förster resonance with a dc field, simultaneously driving excited rotational transitions with an ac field removes all long-range bound states, allowing near complete suppression of all two- and three-body collisional loss channels. While permitting tunable dipolar and anti-dipolar interactions, this bound-state-free ac/dc scheme is not subject to photon-changing collisions that are the primary source of two-body loss in shielding with two microwave fields, used to achieve the first molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Using NaCs as a representative example for strongly dipolar molecules, close-coupling calculations are performed to show that bound-state-free shielding can achieve ratios of elastic-to-loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ at 100 nK, with currently accessible ac and dc field generation technologies. This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions.</p>

            <p>We propose cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in microring resonators as a scalable and efficient approach for directly generating non-Gaussian states of light. Focusing on the well-understood "low-gain" regime, we demonstrate that triplet generation through cascaded SFWM can be achieved with high efficiency and favorable spectral characteristics using realistic microring sources in AlGaAs. The ability to achieve the generation of light in a single set of supermodes -- and the predicted accessibility of the "high-gain" regime at realistic pump powers -- makes this source a promising candidate as a direct and deterministic source of non-Gaussian light for photonic quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Quantum walks (QWs) represent pillars of quantum dynamics and information processing. They provide a powerful framework for simulating quantum transport, designing search algorithms, and enabling universal quantum computation. Several physical platforms have been employed for their implementation, such as trapped atoms and ions, nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and photonic quantum architectures either in bulk optics or waveguide structures and fiber-loop networks. Here we focus on the most promising and versatile approach, that is photonic integrated circuits. In this work, we review how the employment of this versatile experimental platform has allowed to explore several phenomena related to QW-based protocols as, for instance, the evolution in presence of different kinds of noise. In this landscape, to the best of our knowledge, few examples report on the introduction of absorbing centers and their effects on the coherence of the dynamics. Here we present and discuss the results related to absorbing boundaries in QWs obtained through theoretical simulations and experiments conducted with the universal photonic quantum processors realized by Quix Quantum. We analyze how localized absorption along one lattice edge affects the walker dynamics depending on both the leakage probability and the initial injection site. Our results show that the presence of controlled losses modifies interference patterns and coherence, without fully destroying quantum features and providing an effective resource for engineering on-chip QWs and simulating open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nima Leclerc, Chris Miller, Nicholas Brawand</p>
            <p>Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</p>

            <p>Two-photon light-matter interactions exhibit distinctive features such as spectral collapse. The two-photon Dicke model has been reported to exhibit a superradiant phase which could be useful in quantum applications. Here we show that this superradiant phase is not a genuine thermodynamic phase but a finite-size effect. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains. Our results clarify the nature of superradiant conditions in two-photon systems and constrain its realization in quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum technologies promise secure communication networks and powerful new forms of information processing, but building these systems at scale remains a major challenge. Diamond is an especially attractive material for quantum devices because it can host atomic-scale defects that emit single photons and store quantum information with exceptional stability. However, fabricating the optical structures needed to control light in diamond typically relies on slow, bespoke processes that are difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing. These masks define large arrays of nanoscale optical structures, shifting the most demanding pattern-definition steps away from the diamond substrate, improving uniformity, yield, and throughput. Using this method, we demonstrate hundreds of diamond "quantum microchiplets" with improved optical performance and controlled interaction with quantum emitters. The chiplet format allows defective devices to be replaced and enables integration with existing photonic and electronic circuits. Our results show that high-quality diamond quantum devices can be produced using scalable, foundry-compatible techniques. This approach provides a practical pathway toward large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies built on established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Channels on Graphs: a Resonant Tunneling Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Catalano, Farzad Kianvash, Vittorio Giovannetti</p>
            <p>Quantum transport on structured networks is strongly influenced by interference effects, which can dramatically modify how information propagates through a system. We develop a quantum-information-theoretic framework for scattering on graphs in which a full network of connected scattering sites is treated as a quantum channel linking designated input and output ports. Using the Redheffer star product to construct global scattering matrices from local ones, we identify resonant concatenation, a nonlinear composition rule generated by internal back-reflections. In contrast to ordinary channel concatenation, resonant concatenation can suppress noise and even produce super-activation of the quantum capacity, yielding positive capacity in configurations where each constituent channel individually has zero capacity. We illustrate these effects through models exhibiting resonant-tunneling-enhanced transport. Our approach provides a general methodology for analyzing coherent information flow in quantum graphs, with relevance for quantum communication, control, and simulation in structured environments.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Photonic Approach to Graph Coloring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesua Epequin, Pascale Bendotti, Joseph Mikael</p>
            <p>Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a quantum computational model that leverages linear optics to solve sampling problems believed to be classically intractable. Recent experimental breakthroughs have demonstrated quantum advantage using GBS, motivating its application to real-world combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we reformulate the graph coloring problem as an integer programming problem using the independent set formulation. This enables the use of GBS to identify cliques in the complement graph, which correspond to independent sets in the original graph. Our method is benchmarked against classical heuristics and exact algorithms on two sets of instances: Erdős-Rényi random graphs and graphs derived from a smart-charging use case. The results demonstrate that GBS can provide competitive solutions, highlighting its potential as a quantum-enhanced heuristic for graph-based optimization.</p>

            <h2>Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Spectra of Ladder Four-Level System with Quantum Frequency Mixing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Xian Xiao, Tao Wang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we generalized the quantum frequency mixing technology to a ladder-type four-level system and studied its effect on electromagnetically induced transparency spectra. We found a secondary splitting of Autler-Townes splitting in the probing field transmission spectra, which could be understood by the effective Hamiltonian derived with multi-mode Floquet theory. The Frequency mixing scheme developed here enables continuous tunablity of the resonant frequency between upper levels, which facilitates the broad band sensing of AC field. Furthermore, by introducing an additional periodic driving, we realize an effective model that two distinct quantum interference effects coexist: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference arising from closed coherent pathways. Both interference effects could be read out from the transmission spectra independently. The changing of the distance between double splitting peaks represents the interference of Floquet channels, while their asymmetric linewidth broadening is linked with the total effective phase of the loop. This not only provides complementary readout for extracting the phase of AC field, but also establishes a new paradigm for coherent control in multi-level quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid Jump-Diffusion Model for Coherent Optical Control of Quantum Emitters in hBN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saifian Farooq Bhat, Michael K. Koch, Sachin Negi, Alexander Kubanek, Vibhav Bharadwaj</p>
            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional host for stable single-photon emission owing to its wide bandgap, high photostability, and compatibility with nanophotonic integration. We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $\gamma_{\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\mathrm{crit}} \approx 25.91$~K. This hybrid framework provides a quantitative connection between accessible spectroscopic observables and the dominant noise mechanisms limiting coherent optical control in mechanically decoupled quantum emitters, exemplified in hBN and generalizable to similar emitters in other materials.</p>

            <p>Nonclassical states of light and their correlations lie at the heart of quantum optics, serving as fundamental resources that underpin both the exploration of quantum phenomena and the realisation of quantum information protocols. These lecture notes provide an accessible yet rigorous introduction to the foundations of quantum optics, emphasising their relevance to quantum information science and technology. Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of light. Key families of states -- thermal, coherent, and squeezed -- are introduced as paradigmatic examples illustrating the transition from classical to nonclassical behaviour. The concepts of convexity, classicality, and quasiprobability representations are presented as complementary tools for characterising quantumness and defining operational notions such as P-nonclassicality. The discussion extends naturally to Gaussian states, composite systems, and continuous-variable entanglement, highlighting how nonclassicality serves as a resource for generating and quantifying quantum correlations. Theoretical developments are complemented by computational and experimental perspectives, including simulations of optical states using the Python library Strawberry Fields and data analysis from simulated data. Together, these notes aim to bridge the foundational concepts of quantum optics and modern quantum information, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for students and researchers entering the field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arunangshu Debnath, Shaul Mukamel</p>
            <p>In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. It can alleviate bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, circumventing transport in mediating states. The distributions thus created can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting, and the pathways contributing to photon emission events can be classified by tuning filtering parameters. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources and multidimensional photon counting allow promising applications to spectroscopy and sensing.</p>

            <p>Long spin coherence times of carriers are essential for implementing quantum technologies using semiconductor devices for which, however, a possible obstacle is spin relaxation. For the spin dynamics, decisive features are the band structure, crystal symmetry, and quantum confinement. Perovskite semiconductors recently have come into focus of studies of their spin states, notivated by efficient optical access and potentially long-living coherence. Here, we report an electron spin coherence time $T_2$ of the order of 1 ms, measured for a bulk FA$_{0.95}$Cs$_{0.05}$PbI$_3$ lead halide perovskite crystal. Using periodic laser pulses, we synchronize the electron spin Larmor precession about an external magnetic field in an inhomogeneous ensemble, the effect known as spin mode locking. It appears as a decay of the optically created ensemble spin polarization within the dephasing time $T_2^*$ of up to 20 ns and its revival during the spin coherence time $T_2$ reaching the millisecond range. This exceptionally long spin coherence time in a bulk crystal is complemented by millisecond-long longitudinal spin relaxation times $T_1$ for electrons and holes, measured by optically-detected magnetic resonance. These long-lasting spin dynamics highlight perovskites as promising platform for the quantum devices with all-optical control.</p>

            <p>The theory of quantum states over time extends the density operator formalism into the temporal domain, providing a unified of treatment of timelike and spacelike separated systems in quantum theory. Although recent results have characterized quantum states over time involving two timelike separated systems, it remains unclear how to consistently extend the notion of quantum states over time to multipartite temporal scenarios, such as those considered in studies of Leggett-Garg inequalities. In this Letter, we show that two simple assumptions uniquely single out the Markovian multipartite extension of bipartite quantum states over time, namely, linearity in the initial state and a quantum analog of conditionability for multipartite probability distributions. As a direct consequence of our result, we establish a canonical correspondence between multipartite QSOTs and Kirkwood-Dirac type quasiprobability distributions, which we show opens up the possibility of experimentally verifying the temporal correlations encoded in QSOTs via the recent experimental technique of simulating quasiprobability known as quantum snapshotting.</p>

By gathering sufficiently large statistics, we have been able to violate Leggett-Garg inequality and time-order invariance. The detailed analysis of the data on 10 qubit sets from 5 devices available on IBM Quantum and one on IonQ reveals violations beyond 5 standard deviations in almost all cases. We implemented our protocols using fractional gates, newly available on the IBM Heron devices, allowing us to benchmark them in application to weak measurements. The noninvasiveness is supported by a qualitative and quantitative agreement with the model of weak disturbance. Moreover, our data expose statistically significant deviations from theoretical predictions that exceed declared device error rates, establishing weak measurement protocols as a sensitive benchmark for quantum hardware. These advances transform public quantum computers into practical testbeds for probing foundational questions of realism and temporal order with unprecedented accessibility and precision.</p>

We show that, in the open quantum chain with LSE, QME can be easily realized by considering only the spatial profile of initial states, since the initial states localized on the left or right edges experience distinctive relaxation process (algebraic or exponential decay). This approach circumvents the necessity of careful initial-state design and fine-tuning of control parameter. Moreover, when the initial correlation matrix contains off-diagonal elements, we uncover a new kind of QME which manifest as two crossings in the Hilbert-Schmidt distance at different times. This work unveils the deep connection between QME and LSE, and provides a physically intuitive understanding of QME and straightforward pathway for the initial state preparation thereby enabling readily accessible experimental preparation.</p>

            <h2>Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu Li, Xiao-Han Yang, Xiao-Yu Dong</p>
            <p>The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <p>Recently, it has been shown that a quantum system held in spatial superposition and then eventually recombined does experience decoherence from black hole horizons, at a level increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. In this, the effects of the horizon have been derived using a classical spacetime picture for the latter. In the present note we point out that quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the quantum black hole could significantly affect the results. In a specific effective implementation of the quantum geometry in terms of a minimal length and ensuing minimal area, it appears in particular that, for selected values of the quantum of area proposed on various grounds in the literature, the decoherence induced by the horizon turns out to be limited to negligibly small values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Joseph Fahn, Alessandro Pesci</p>
            <p>There is mounting theoretical evidence that black hole horizons induce decoherence on a quantum system, say a particle, put in a superposition of locations, with the decoherence functional, evaluated after closure of the superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes, that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area $A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.</p>

            <p>The simulation of strongly correlated fermionic systems remains one of the most significant challenges in computational physics due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the fermionic sign problem. In this work, we present a digital quantum simulation framework to explore the Fermi polaron and the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover. We develop a unified Hamiltonian formalism that bridges pairing superfluidity and impurity physics, mapping the system onto a gate-based quantum processor via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Using a first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, we implement a Ramsey interferometry protocol to extract the real-time dynamics and spectral response of the system. Our results demonstrate a smooth transition from a dressed quasiparticle (polaron) regime to a stable molecular bound state, characterized by a linear energy renormalization in the strong-coupling limit. We validate our simulation against exact classical benchmarks and report successful execution on the Barcelona Supercomputing Center quantum hardware.

            <h2>Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian for ab initio hybrid quantum-classical molecular design with applications to photodynamic therapy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil Zak</p>
            <p>Relativistic spin effects drive subtle molecular phenomena ranging from intersystem crossing in photodynamic therapy to spin-mediated catalysis and high-resolution spectroscopy. These effects are described by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian, which extends the nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian by including one- and two-electron spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions. First-principles simulations of the full Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian rapidly become intractable on classical computers due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the complexity of two-body spin-dependent terms. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing molecular energy levels and properties governed by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian. Our approach block-encodes the relativistic Hamiltonian in a second-quantized, doubly factorized representation. By reformulating the Hamiltonian in a symmetry-adapted Majorana basis, we construct efficient linear-combination-of-unitaries circuits that encode spin-orbit interactions without effective or mean-field approximations. We introduce spin-controlled Pauli-SWAP networks that decouple spin and orbital control logic, enabling a unified treatment of relativistic spin mixing with only modest overhead relative to spin-free simulations. We analyze quantum resources in terms of logical qubits and T-gate complexity, showing that explicit spin degrees of freedom do not worsen the asymptotic scaling. The prefactor is reduced by a factor of two compared to direct linear-combination-of-unitaries approaches. Finally, we outline a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for designing photodynamic therapy photosensitizers, artificial photosynthesis catalysts, and other systems where accurate relativistic spin effects are essential.</p>

            <h2>Complete transparency with three active-passive-coupled optical resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Bo Yan, Liu Yang, Bing He</p>
            <p>The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.</p>

            <h2>Qubit-qudit entanglement transfer in defect centers with high-spin nuclei</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W.-R. Hannes, Guido Burkard</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme for accumulating entanglement between long-lived qudits provided by central nuclear spins of defect centers. Assuming a generic setting, the electron spin of each node acts as the communication qubit and may be entangled with other nodes, e.g., through a spin-photon interface. The generally available Ising component of the hyperfine interaction is shown to facilitate repeated entanglement transfer onto memory qudits of arbitrary dimension $d\le 2I+1$ with $I$ the nuclear spin quantum number. When $d$ is set to an integer power of two, maximal entanglement can be generated deterministically and without intermittent driving of nuclear spins. The scheme is applicable to several candidate systems, including the $^{73}$Ge germanium vacancy in diamond.</p>

In particular, we consider three algorithms for solving the ground state energy estimation problem: the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum Krylov, and quantum phase estimation. By utilizing exact classical simulation, numerical estimation, and analytical bounds, we provide a current and future outlook for using quantum computers to solve impactful biochemical and biological problems. Our results show that variational methods, while being the most heuristic, still require substantially fewer overall resources on quantum hardware, and could feasibly address such problems on current or near-future devices.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiwen Weng, Zhaoyuan Meng, Zixuan Yang, Guohui Hu</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model that describes diverse complex phenomena in nature. However, simulating the NLSE on a quantum computer is inherently challenging due to the presence of the nonlinear term. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating the NLSE based on the split-step Fourier method. During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions. This work provide a concrete basis for analyzing accuracy-cost trade-offs in quantum-classical simulations of nonlinear dispersive wave dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siri Raupach, Beatriz Olmos, Mathias B. M. Svendsen</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for fast, robust and high-fidelity topological quantum state transfer in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings, motivated by chains of Rydberg atoms with dipole-dipole interactions. Such long-range interactions naturally give rise to extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models supporting topologically protected edge states. We show that these edge states enable high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer using both time-independent protocols, based on coherent edge state dynamics, and time-dependent protocols, based on adiabatic modulation of system parameters. Long-range couplings play a central role by enhancing the relevant energy gaps, leading to a substantial improvement in transfer efficiency compared to nearest neighbour models. The resulting transfer is robust against positional disorder, reflecting its topological origin and highlighting the potential of long-range interacting platforms for reliable quantum state transfer.</p>

            <p>Advances in quantum technologies are accelerating the demand for optical quantum state sensors that combine high precision, versatility, and scalability within a unified hardware platform. Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/\gamma \approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes. By reducing reliance on material nonlinearity and reservoir size, the proposed approach facilitates the practical deployment of high-fidelity photonic quantum sensors on existing integrated platforms, paving the way toward chip-scale quantum processors and photonic sensing technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swati Choudhary, Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>The minimum error probability for distinguishing between two quantum states is bounded by the Helstrom limit, derived under the assumption that measurement strategies are restricted to positive operator-valued measurements. We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, indicating the use of measurement operations that go beyond the standard positive operator-valued measurements framework. We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination. Interestingly, even initial product states can give rise to effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem, and achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination error when discriminating quantum states of the subsystem.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate direct, non-invasive and non-contact detection of human cardiac magnetic signals using quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Three configurations were employed recording magnetocardiography (MCG) signals in various shielded and unshielded environments. The signals were averaged over a few hundreds up to several thousands of heart beats to detect the MCG traces. The compact room-temperature NV sensors exhibit sensitivities of 6-26 pT/Hz^(1/2) with active sensing volumes below 0.5 mm^3, defining the performance level of the demonstrated MCG measurements. While the present signals are obtained by averaging, this performance already indicates a clear path toward single-shot MCG sensing. To move beyond shielded environments toward practical clinical use, strong noise suppression is required. To this end, we implement NV-based gradiometry and achieve efficient common-mode noise rejection, enabled by the intrinsically small sensing volume of NV sensors. Together, these multi-platform results obtained across diverse magnetic environments provide a solid foundation for translating quantum sensors into human medical diagnostics such as MCG and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</p>

            <h2>When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nima Leclerc, Chris Miller, Nicholas Brawand</p>
            <p>Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</p>

            <p>We present a Rydberg atom-based microwave electric field sensor that achieves extended dynamic range and enhanced sensitivity across a broad bandwidth. By characterizing the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting induced by a single-tone microwave field, we demonstrate a spectroscopic method that simultaneously extracts both the microwave frequency and electric field strength directly from the splitting pattern. We implement dual-tone heterodyne detection, achieving a minimum detectable field strength on the order of uV/cm and a sensitivity in the sub-uV/cm/Hz^1/2 regime, while extending the operational bandwidth up to 3 GHz. Through systematic characterization of frequency and power dependencies, we identify optimal operating conditions to minimize power broadening in the resonant AT regime and maximize sensitivity in the far-off-resonance AC Stark regime. The resulting platform combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, and a dynamic range of approximately 90 dB, establishing Rydberg atoms as practical sensors for precision electric field metrology.</p>

            <p>As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance across various tasks, attention-driven models have profoundly transformed the field of machine learning. Since attention computations account for the primary computational overhead in both model inference and training, efficiently computing attention matrices has become one of the core challenges in accelerating large language models. It is well-known that quantum machines possess computational advantages over classical machines, and the role of quantum computing in LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on leveraging the Grover search algorithm to efficiently compute a sparse attention matrix. Through comparisons with classical algorithms, we demonstrate that our method achieves quantum acceleration in polynomial time. Additionally, we observe that the generated quantum attention matrices naturally exhibit low-rank structures, providing further theoretical support for efficient modeling. Moreover, within the specific context of attention matrix computation, we conduct a systematic and detailed analysis of the error and time complexity of the proposed algorithm.</p>

            <p>Solid state defects such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been utilized for NMR sensing at ambient temperatures for samples at the nano-scale and up to the micro-scale. Similar to standard NMR, NV-sensitivities can be increased using tesla-valued magnetic fields to boost nuclear thermal polarization, while structural parameters, such as chemical shifts, are also enhanced. However, with standard microwave (MW) based sensing techniques, NV centers struggle to track fast megahertz Larmor frequencies encountered in high-field scenarios. Previous protocols have addressed this by mapping target NMR parameters to the signal amplitude rather than the frequency, using a mediating RF field. Although successful, protocol sensitivities are limited by the coherence time ($T_2^*$) of the NMR signal owing to the presence of stages where the sample magnetization freely evolves. In this work, we propose extending this coherence time, and consequently improving sensitivity, via amplitude encoding with weak nuclear spin locking instead of free evolution, thereby taking advantage of the longer sample coherence times ($T_{1\rho}$). We demonstrate this can enhance protocol sensitivities by $\gtrsim 4$ times.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems have attracted considerable interest over the last few decades due to their unique spectral and dynamical properties not encountered in Hermitian counterparts. An intensely debated question is whether non-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are operated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current analysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for Hermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space metric is intrinsically parameter dependent. Here, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) defined on the deformed Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This covariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a consistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the covariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems is dual to the ordinary QFI of corresponding Hermitian systems. Importantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the covariant QFI and allows one to identify optimal projections which saturate the corresponding classical Fisher information to this ultimate limit. The developed framework also enables to set the criteria under which pseudo-Hermitian sensors can exhibit an advantage over their Hermitian counterparts of the same dimensionality.</p>

            <p>Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. Moreover, we demonstrate how the three-party protocol can be generalized to many-body swapping networks, enabling a general many-body state sharing with unit fidelity via arbitrary number of intermediate nodes. This is achieved by replacing all but one of the unitary operations with those corresponding to the same Schmidt states but with a flattened spectrum, which also completely eliminates the need for postselection. We provide a proof of concept of the three-party protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as fault-tolerant entanglement swapping and new strategies for distributed quantum computing.</p>

Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes.

            <p>Extending upon the observations of the emergence of quantum-like states from classical complex synchronized networks, this work adds mathematical rigor to the analysis of single Quantum-Like (QL) bits constructed by eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of such networks. First, we rigorously show that symmetric construction of such networks (regular undirected/symmetric bipartite graph $G_C$ connecting two regular undirected subgraphs $G_A,\,G_B$) leads to an equal superposition of the $|+\rangle, |-\rangle$ Hadamard states (with basis $|0\rangle,\,|1\rangle$ set from eigenvectors of the subgraphs), and provide an analysis of sufficient conditions on the network for construction of such states. Second, we prove two methods to construct any arbitrary single qubit state $|\psi\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle,\, |a|^2+|b|^2=1$ and provide a switching lemma for the boundaries of both methods. The first method of construction is by detuning the regularities of the two subgraphs and the second is by asymmetrically constructing the bipartite connection matrix $C$ by allowing it to be directed, and then detuning those regularities. While the intuition is derived from the motivation of using complex synchronized networks for quantum information storage and computations, the proofs for constructing eigenvectors that interact in a quantum-like fashion only require the structure of the graph embedded in the adjacency matrix. Practically, this means that synchronization is not important to creating quantum-like bits, only that the edge weights are generally unit or close to unit and that the subgraphs are regular. As such, the results on combinations of random k-regular graphs (precisely Erdős-Rényi graphs) may be independently interesting.</p>

            <p>Quantum algorithms based on classical processing of individual samples have recently emerged as the most effective and robust methods to approximate ground-state wave functions of many-body quantum systems on pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In these algorithms, the quantum computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. The recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is well approximated by a polynomial subset of the full Hilbert space. However, implementations of SKQD for complex many-body Hamiltonians, such as quantum chemistry ones, are limited by the depths of time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. In this work, we introduce a method that combines SKQD with a qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables quantum chemistry experiments on quantum processors, while preserving the convergence guarantees similar to the phase estimation algorithm. We demonstrate its viability by applying SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.</p>

            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranav Kulkarni, Leo Sünkel, Michael Kölle</p>
            <p>Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link.</p>

            <h2>Atomtronic superconducting quantum interference device in synthetic dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxi Lai, Yu-Quan Ma, Yi-Wen Wei</p>
            <p>Coherence and scalability are essential properties of quantum systems required in quantum computers. This study presents a high coherent and scalable qubit system with atomtronics in synthetic dimensions. It is atomtronic counterpart of superconducting quantum interference device. Comparing with traditional superconducting quantum interference device which requires at least $2$-dimensional circuits, the synthetic dimensional superconducting quantum interference device can be realized only in $1$-dimensional circuits. The synthetic dimensional system is composed of Bose-Einstein condensate in two neighboring optical wells which is coupled to an external coherent light. Control parameter for the qubit is naturally provided by artificial magnetic flux originated from the coherent atom-light coupling. It should be a great advantage for the scalability and integration feature of quantum logic gates.</p>

            <h2>Kramers Dichroism in PT Symmetric Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oles Matsyshyn, Ying Xiong, Justin C. W. Song</p>
            <p>Superpositions between states in doubly degenerate Kramers pairs can act as an internal degree of freedom. Here we uncover a Kramers dichroism in PT symmetric magnets: interband transitions induced by circularly polarized light irradiation produce a coherent superposition between Kramers partnered states. This allows to optically control the Kramers degree of freedom. In contrast, Kramers pairs optically excited by linearly polarized light remain in a completely mixed state. Strikingly, we find a class of second-order nonlinear responses that directly track the coherence between Kramers partnered states. Such Kramers nonlinearities can be pronounced producing large second-order nonlinear layer polarization responses activated by Kramers degeneracy in layered antiferromagnets. Together with Kramers dichroism, these render optical responses a novel means for accessing the Kramers degree of freedom and diagnosing their quantum coherent state.</p>

            <h2>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from a conserved current, application to the massive scalar boson</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domenico P.L. Castrigiano, Carmine De Rosa, Valter Moretti</p>
            <p>Only recently the concept of achronal localization has been developed as the adequate frame for the description of the localizability of a relativistic quantum mechanical system. Here covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method is applied to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. As (covariant) achronal localizations correspond one-to-one to (covariant) representations of the causal logic, thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly a covariant family of representations of the causal logic is derived from the stress-energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. The construction of an achronal localization from a conserved current relies on a version of the divergence theorem for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary. This result is stated and proved in this work.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Westhoff, Sebastian Paeckel, Mattia Moroder</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of the dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information-theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that a two-polariton blockade (2PB) can occur under resonant single-polariton driving in an atom-cavity system operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime-a phenomenon qualitatively distinct from, and unattainable in, both the strong and weak coupling regimes. In the USC regime, where the ratio of the atom-cavity coupling strength to the cavity resonance frequency exceeds 0.1, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles known as polaritons emerge. By employing modified second- and third-order correlation functions appropriate for the USC regime, we predict the emergence of 2PB, characterized by pronounced two-polariton bunching accompanied by suppressed three-polariton coincidences. This Letter introduces a novel route to achieving 2PB, with promising implications for the realization of multiparticle quantum light sources in the USC regime.</p>

Quantum illumination(QI) is the quantum mechanical technique along with analysis of light matter interaction from source to detection end that connects quantum principle to hardware implementation. Superposition and entanglement control are deeply needed for the information-qubit processing in quantum computing. Improvement of measurement and performance are directly linked to detecting weak signal or intensity. This paper motivated that using quantum-enhanced technique how we can analysis previous superposition of qubit state which can clearly analyzed quantum interference diffraction patterns and its superposition using double slit experiment. Then constructed quantum neural network back propagation technique such that can give information of qubit position in any previous superposition state.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Zhao, Zeliang Wu, Haoran Liu, Yueya Liu, Xin Chen, Xinyun Liang, Wenfeng Huang, Chun-Hua Yuan, L.Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum interferometers offer phase measurement capabilities that surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), with phase sensitivity and quantum enhancement factor serving as key performance metrics. However, practical implementations face severe degradation of both metrics due to unavoidable losses, representing the foremost challenge in advancing quantum interferometry toward real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent-amplifier-empowered quantum interferometer. The coherent amplifier dramatically suppresses the decay of both sensitivity and quantum enhancement under high-loss conditions, maintaining phase sensitivity beyond the original SQL even for losses exceeding 90%. Using an injected 4.2 dB squeezed-vacuum state in experimental demonstration, our scheme reduces the quantum enhancement degradation under 90% loss from 3.7 dB in a conventional quantum interferometer (CQI) to only 1.5 dB. More importantly, the phase sensitivity degradation under the same loss is limited to 4.0 dB, markedly outperforming the 11.2 dB degradation observed in a CQI. This improvement is enabled by the coherent amplifier's phase-sensitive photon amplification and its protection of the quantum state. This breakthrough in amplifier-empowered quantum interferometry overcomes the critical barrier to practical deployment, enabling robust quantum-enhanced measurements in lossy environments.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Aharonov-Bohm Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shan Gao</p>
            <p>The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect highlights the fundamental role of electromagnetic potentials in quantum mechanics, manifesting as a phase shift for a charged particle in field-free regions. While well-established for static magnetic fluxes, the effect's behavior under time-varying fluxes remains an open and debated question. Employing the WKB method, we derive the AB phase shift for a time-dependent magnetic vector potential, demonstrating that for circular paths in the quasistatic regime, it is proportional to the time-averaged enclosed magnetic flux, \(\Delta \phi_{\rm AB} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T e \Phi(t) \, dt\), with the total phase shift, including kinetic contributions, equaling \(e \Phi(0)\). For non-circular paths, the phase shift depends on both the flux history and path geometry, revealing the effect's hybrid nature involving gauge potentials and induced electric fields. We verify the consistency of our gauge choice with Maxwell's equations and discuss the implications for local versus nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect. We also generalize the results to scenarios with nonzero external magnetic fields, where the enclosed flux is through the actual electron paths, and for circular paths of radius $R$, the AB phase shift is also proportional to the time average of the enclosed flux \(\Phi_{\rm enc}(R,t)\), with the total phase shift depending only on the initial enclosed flux \(e \Phi_{\rm enc}(R,0)\); for general non-circular paths, the external magnetic field affects trajectories and phase accumulation through the Lorentz force, leading to additional path dependence. These findings clarify the role of gauge-dependent potentials and induced fields in the generalized AB effect, offering new theoretical insights and potential applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) relies on Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes to reach error rates necessary for large scale quantum applications. At a physical level, QEC codes perform parity checks on data qubits, producing syndrome information, through Syndrome Measurement (SM) circuits. These circuits define a code's logical error rate and must be run repeatedly throughout the entire program. The performance of SM circuits is therefore critical to the success of a FTQC system. While ultimately implemented as physical circuits, SM circuits have challenges that are not addressed by existing circuit optimization tools. Importantly, inside SM circuits themselves errors are expected to occur, and how errors propagate through SM circuits directly impacts which errors are detectable and correctable, defining the code's logical error rate. This is not modeled in NISQ-era tools, which instead optimize for targets such as gate depth or gate count to mitigate the chance that any error occurs. This gap leaves key questions unanswered about the expected real-world effectiveness of QEC codes. In this work we address this gap and present PropHunt, an automated tool for optimizing SM circuits for CSS codes. We evaluate PropHunt on a suite of relevant QEC codes and demonstrate PropHunt's ability to iteratively improve performance and recover existing hand-designed circuits automatically. We also propose a near-term QEC application, Hook-ZNE, which leverages PropHunt's fine-grained control over logical error rate to improve Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), a promising error mitigation strategy.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Phase Transitions in the Transverse-Field Ising Model: A Comparative Study of Exact, Variational, and Hardware-Based Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudraksh Sharma</p>
            <p>The quantum phase transitions provide a paradigm for studying collective quantum phenomena that are a result of competing non-commuting interactions. This paper will study the ground state properties and quantum critical dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model through a combined perspective that includes exact diagonalisation, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulations, and simulations on realistic physical quantum devices. We focus on a lattice of four spins, where we calculate the ground-state energies, magnetic order parameters and correlation functions at uniformly applied conditions, which is repeated by all systems. Precise diagonalisation provides both a benchmark, which is symmetry-conserving, and a depth-two, physics inspired variational approximation, which provides simulations accessible to hardware. The circuits that have been optimised identically are then placed on the IQM Garnet quantum processor, using a resource-efficient batched protocol. We find that the ground-state energies of shallow variational circuits are reliably captured by the circuit over the entire parameter space; the magnetic arrangement parameters and observables sensitive to correlation signal significantly more noise. The error analysis of quantitative analysis reveals a strong broadening of critical crossover on hardware, which is consistent with the noise attenuation of long-range correlations. These findings highlight the current capabilities as well as the fundamental limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems in modelling quantum critical phenomena as a benchmark to future enhancements in obtaining quantum hardware and quantum algorithms development.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors offer significant advantages over classical devices in spatial resolution and sensitivity, enabling transformative applications across materials science, healthcare, and beyond. Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields. In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model. These results are broadly applicable to a wide range of quantum sensing platforms, not limited to single-spin systems, and are particularly valuable for real-time adaptive protocols, where model inaccuracies can otherwise lead to suboptimal control and degraded performance.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Decoherence Times in Finite-Memory Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramandeep Dewan</p>
            <p>Decoherence is often modeled using Markovian master equations that predict exponential suppression of coherence and are frequently used as effective bounds on quantum behavior in complex environments. Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case. For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel. These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit. Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computation in photonic architectures relies on the efficient preparation of high-fidelity logical magic states under realistic constraints imposed by finite squeezing and photon loss. In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity. These results provide quantitative design guidance for scalable photonic fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>Non-adiabatic dynamics at molecule-metal interfaces govern diverse and technologically important phenomena, from heterogeneous catalysis to dye-sensitized solar energy conversion and charge transport across molecular junctions. Realistic modeling of such dynamics necessitates taking into account various charge and energy transfer channels involving the coupling of nuclear motion with a very large number of electronic states, leading to prohibitive cost using classical computational methods. In this work we introduce a generalization of the Anderson-Newns Hamiltonian and develop a highly optimized quantum algorithm for simulating the non-adiabatic dynamics of realistic molecule-metal interfaces. Using the PennyLane software platform, we perform resource estimations of our algorithm, showing its remarkably low implementation cost for model systems representative of various scientifically and industrially relevant molecule-metal systems. Specifically, we find that time evolution for models including $100$ metal orbitals, $8$ molecular orbitals, and $20$ nuclear degrees of freedom, requires only $271$ qubits and $7.9 \times 10^7$ Toffoli gates for $1000$ Trotter steps, suggesting non-adiabatic molecule-metal dynamics as a fruitful application of first-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

In this strongly confined geometry, atomic coherence is profoundly influenced by wall-induced relaxation arising from frequent atom-surface collisions. By analyzing both absorption and fluorescence spectra, we demonstrate that the optical response is dominated by a closed cycling transition, which effectively isolates the atomic dynamics to a two-level configuration despite the presence of multiple hyperfine states. This confinement-induced selection suppresses optical pumping into uncoupled states and enables robust, controllable light-matter interaction at telecom wavelengths within a miniature atomic platform. Our results establish a practical route to realizing near-infrared atomic two-level systems in compact vapor-cell devices, opening new opportunities for integrated quantum photonic technologies, including on-chip quantum memories, telecom-band frequency references, and scalable quantum information processing.</p>

A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement harvesting in the presence of cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jannik Ströhle, Nikolija Momcilovic</p>
            <p>So far, entanglement harvesting has been extensively studied in free space setups. Here, we provide a detailed analytical and numerical analysis of entanglement harvesting in cavities. Specifically, we adiabatically couple the quantized electromagnetic field to two identical Gaussian detectors located on the symmetry axis of a cylindrical cavity. Our numerical investigations reveal a strong dependence on the cavity length, while showing invariance under changes in the cavity radius in regimes of maximal entanglement. Moreover, we identify different scalings of the detector system parameters for entanglement inside and outside the light cone. Finally, we uncover a strong dependence of the harvested correlations on the cavity induced parity of the electromagnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Generation of fully phase controlled two-photon entangled states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Ford, Adrien Amour, Matthias Keller</p>
            <p>Control over the internal states of trapped ions makes them the ideal system to generate single and two-photon states. Coupling a single ion to an optical cavity enables efficient emission of single photons into a single spatial mode and grants control over their temporal shape, phase and frequency. Using the long coherence time of the ion's internal states and employing a scheme to protect the coherence of the ion-cavity interaction, we demonstrate the generation of a two-photon entangled state with full control over the phase. Initially, ion-photon entanglement is generated. A second photon is subsequently generated, mapping the ion's state onto the second photon. By adjusting the drive field the phase of the entangled state can be fully controlled. We implement this scheme in the most resource efficient way by utilizing a single $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion coupled to an optical cavity and demonstrate the generation of a two-photon entangled stated with full phase control with a fidelity of up to 82\%.</p>

The protocol combines a new geometric phase gate which can be utilized for exact unitary synthesis on the Dicke subspace, an analytic solution of the noisy quantum channel dynamics and optimal control methods.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Xue, Jacob P. Covey, Matthew Otten</p>
            <p>Quantum chemistry is a promising application of future quantum computers, but the requirements on qubit count and other resources suggest that modular computing architectures will be required. We introduce an implementation of a quantum chemistry algorithm that is distributed across several computational modules: the distributed unitary selective coupled cluster (dUSCC). We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\sim$20$\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be "free" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of "free" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.</p>

            <p>Theoretical analysis demonstrates that a spin qubit in a parabolic quantum wire, when driven by a bichromatic field, exhibits a confinement-tunable synthetic gauge field leading to novel Floquet topological phenomena. The underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations is presented. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, characterized by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. The emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Furthermore, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, such as fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunnelling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Concrete experimental pathways for realizing these effects in semiconductor heterostructures are proposed, and the framework is extended to multi-qubit entanglement generation with a quantitative analysis of its inherent resilience to decoherence. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials as a versatile and scalable platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Precision limit under weak-coupling with ancillary qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Chen, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>We propose a measurement-based quantum metrology protocol in a composite model, where the probe system (a spin ensemble) is coupled to an ancillary two-level system (qubit) with a general Heisenberg XXZ interaction. With an optimized and weak probe-ancilla coupling strength and a proper duration of joint evolution, the two parallel evolution paths of the probe system induced by the unconditional measurement on qubit can transform an eigenstate of the collective angular momentum operator of spin ensemble to be a two-component state with a large distance in eigenspace. The quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system of polarized states or their superposition, that could be relaxed to mixed states, can therefore manifest an exact or asymptotic quadratic scaling with respect to the probe size (spin number) $N$. The quadratic scaling behavior is found to be insensitive to the imperfect encoding operator and coupling strength. By virtue of the parity detection on the ancillary qubit or the probe system, the phase sensitivity can approach the Heisenberg limit. We suggest that the unconditional measurement on qubit could become an efficient resource to replace Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like states and squeezing Hamiltonian for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision.</p>

            <p>Quantum channel capacities are fundamental to quantum information theory. Their definition, however, does not limit the computational resources of sender and receiver. In this work, we initiate the study of computational quantum capacities. These quantify how much information can be reliably transmitted when imposing the natural requirement that en- and decoding have to be computationally efficient. We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm. Our results demonstrate that the natural requirement of computational efficiency can radically alter the limits of quantum communication.</p>

This approach cleanly distinguishes the roles of information spreading, entanglement, and chaos for enabling both coherent state transfer and recovery.

            <h2>Bright Pulsed Squeezed Light for Quantum-Enhanced Precision Microscopy</h2>

            <p>Squeezed states of light enable enhanced measurement precision by reducing noise below the standard quantum limit. A key application of squeezed light is nonlinear microscopy, where state-of-the-art performance is limited by photodamage and quantum-limited noise. Such microscopes require bright, pulsed light for optimal operation, yet generating and detecting bright pulsed squeezing at high levels remains challenging. In this work, we present an efficient technique to generate high levels of bright picosecond pulsed squeezed light using a $\chi^2$ optical parametric amplification process in a waveguide. We measure $-3.2~\mathrm{dB}$ of bright squeezing with optical power compatible with nonlinear microscopy, as well as $-3.6~\mathrm{dB}$ of vacuum squeezing. Corrected for losses, these squeezing levels correspond to $-15.4^{+2.7}_{-8.7}~\mathrm{dB}$ of squeezing generated in the waveguide. The measured level of bright amplitude pulsed squeezing is to our knowledge the highest reported to date, and will contribute to the broader adoption of quantum-enhanced nonlinear microscopy in biological studies.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology typically demands the preparation of exotic quantum probe states, such as entangled or squeezed states, to surpass classical limits. However, the need for carefully calibrated system parameters and finely optimized quantum controls imposes limitations on scalability and robustness. Here, we circumvent these limitations by introducing an echoed random process that achieves sensitivity approaching the Heisenberg limit while remaining blind to the random probe state. We demonstrate that by simply driving a Kerr nonlinear mode with random pulses, the emergence of sub-Planck phase-space structures grants high sensitivity, eliminating the need for complex quantum control. The protocol is statistically robust, yielding high performance across broad driving parameter ranges while exhibiting resilience to control fluctuations and photon loss. Broadly applicable to both bosonic and qubit platforms, our work reveals a practical, hardware-efficient, scalable, and optimization-free route to quantum-enhanced metrology in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metrology under Coarse-Grained Measurement</h2>

            <p>While quantum metrology enables measurement precision beyond classical limits, its performance is often susceptible to experimental imperfections. Most prior studies have focused on imperfections in quantum states and operations. Here, we investigate the effect of coarse graining in quantum measurement through both theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration. Using an interferometer with a squeezed vacuum and a laser input, we analyze how coarse graining in homodyne detection affects the precision of phase estimation. We evaluate the Fisher information under various coarse-graining conditions and determine, in each case, an optimal estimation strategy that saturates the Cramér-Rao bound. Remarkably, even extremely coarse-grained measurement -- with only two bins -- enables phase estimation beyond the standard quantum limit and even achieves a precision that follows the Heisenberg scaling. We experimentally demonstrate quantum-enhanced phase estimation under coarse-grained homodyne detection. To determine an optimal estimation strategy, we employ the method of moments and present calibration procedures that enable its application to general experimental settings. Using only two bins, we observe a quantum enhancement of 1.2 dB compared to the classical method using the ideal measurement, improving towards 3.8 dB as the bin number increases. These results highlight a practical pathway to achieving quantum enhancement under the presence of severe experimental imperfections.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanausú Hernández-Yanes, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski, Marcin Płodzień</p>
            <p>Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Yu Wang, Bao-Zong Wang, Jian-Song Hong, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and uncover exotic universal features from a systematic investigation. In particular, we show that for generic bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians, the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding of hard-core bosonic zero modes. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by a nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with and without the aid of a controlled defect, respectively. Analytic and numerical results are given. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to observe these predictions and identify the parameter regimes for the high-fidelity braiding, paving the way for the experimental observation of our results in the near future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Corentin Lanore, Xavier Valcarce, Jean Etesse, Anthony Martin, Jean-Daniel Bancal</p>
            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols enable two distant parties to communicate with information-theoretically proven secrecy. However, these protocols are generally vulnerable to potential mismatches between the physical modeling and the implementation of their quantum operations, thereby opening opportunities for side channel attacks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD addresses this problem by reducing the degree of device modeling to a black-box setting. The stronger security obtained in this way comes at the cost of a reduced noise tolerance, rendering experimental demonstrations more challenging: so far, only one experiment based on trapped ions was able to successfully generate a secret key. Photonic platforms have however long been preferred for QKD thanks to their suitability to optical fiber transmission, high repetition rates, readily available hardware, and potential for circuit integration. In this work, we assess the feasibility of DIQKD on a photonic circuit recently identified by machine learning techniques. For this, we introduce an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that takes into account full outcome statistics. Our analysis shows that the proposed optical circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization realistic.</p>

This approach enables the computation of thermal and ground-state properties while retaining the key computational advantages of Pauli Propagation. Benchmarking ITPP on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model demonstrates that truncation provides a controlled trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, while also revealing challenges associated with operator growth under imaginary time evolution. Finally, combining imaginary time and real-time Pauli Propagation naturally suggests a pathway toward simulating open quantum system dynamics within a unified framework.</p>

            <p>The temporal degree-of-freedom of light is incredibly powerful for modern quantum technologies, enabling large-scale quantum computing architectures and record key-rates in quantum key distribution. However, the generalized measurement of large and complex quantum superpositions of the time-of-arrival of a photon remains a unique experimental challenge. Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization. In addition, these are limited by construction to a restricted set of phase-only superposition measurements. Here we show how the coupling of spatial and temporal information inside a single multi-mode fiber can be harnessed to program completely generalized measurements for high-dimensional superpositions of photonic time-bin. Using the multi-spectral transmission matrix of the fiber, we find special sets of spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays through the fiber. By exciting coherent superpositions of these spatial modes, we engineer the equivalent of large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber and use them to perform high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions in up to dimension 11. The single fiber functions as a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits that significantly eases the experimental overheads of standard approaches based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers, serving as an essential tool for quantum technologies that harness the temporal properties of light.</p>

            <p>Nonlocal light-matter interactions with giant atoms in high-dimensional environments are not only fundamentally intriguing for testing quantum electrodynamics beyond the dipole approximation but also crucial for building high-dimensional quantum networks and engineering multipartite entangled states. Given the enigmatic and largely uncharted collective signatures exhibited by multiple giant atoms within two-dimensional optical baths, we delve into their nonperturbative collective dynamics within the single-excitation subspace, focusing on the case where they are coupled to a common two-dimensional photonic reservoir and employing a resolvent operator approach. We demonstrate that precisely engineered atomic arrangements lead to unconventional quantum dynamics, featuring non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in the continuum, thereby providing a versatile platform for implementing two-dimensional quantum memory. Phenomenologically, we observe the emergence of exotic photon emission patterns in both two- and three-dimensional (3D) baths. The emission directions are shown to be precisely controllable on demand through exact phase engineering of the coupling parameters, enabling a highly efficient chiral light-matter interface. Moreover, our generalization to a 3D bath reveals that coherent dipole-dipole interactions can survive despite the coupling to a continuum of modes, a finding that challenges conventional wisdom regarding decoherence.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubit networks (SQNs) embedded in a low-dissipative resonator is a promising device allowing one not only to establish the collective quantum dynamics on a macroscopic scale but also to greatly enhance the sensitivity of detectors of microwave photons. A quantum ac Stark effect provided by coupling between an SQN and microwave photons of a resonator, leads to a strong nonlinear interaction between photons. Here, we present a two-tone spectroscopy experiment in which a set of 10 superconducting flux qubits is coupled to the input R- resonator and the output T- transmission line. An external microwave pump field close to the resonance frequency populates macroscopically the resonator mode as a Bose-Einstein condensate, while a second probe beam scans the resonances referred also as Bogoliubov-like excitations. The corresponding excitation frequency measured from the transmission coefficient, |S21(f)| displays an abrupt change of the resonant dip position once the power of the pump field overcomes a critical value Pcr. This sharp shift occurs in a narrow region of pump frequencies, and can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. It is a signature of bistability of the photon number inside the resonator, in agreement with theory.</p>

            <p>Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linear optical gain. However, spontaneous emission is not a fundamental property of the emitter. By engineering metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters into microcavities coupled to patch antennas, we have demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting a collimated beam with excellent spatial properties and a factor 100 increase in the collected power, compared to standard devices. Our results illustrate that by reshaping the photonic environment around emitting dipoles, as in the Purcell effect, it is possible to enhance the spontaneous emission and conceive efficient optoelectronic light emitting devices that operate close to the thermodynamical equilibrium as LEDs in the visible range.</p>

In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev.

Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.</p>

The QATM, composed of two qubits each coupled to independent thermal reservoirs, interacts with an external system of two additional qubits. By analyzing the Hilbert space structure, energy level configurations, and temperature gradients, we define a common interaction between the QATM qubits and the external system qubits, which allows the definition of two thermodynamic cycles (A and B) governed by virtual temperatures and energy-conserving transitions. We demonstrate that the QATM can act as a structured reservoir capable of inducing non-Markovian memory effects, as highlighted by negative entropy production rates. Using mutual information and concurrence, we show that entanglement is generated only under cycle A, which is associated with stronger non-Markovian behavior and higher coherence correlations. Our results demonstrate that temperature differences, Hilbert space structure, and coherence serve as quantum resources for controlling and enhancing entanglement in quantum thermodynamic settings, with parameters consistent with experimental superconducting qubit platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sota Yoshida, Takeshi Sato, Takumi Ogata, Masaaki Kimura</p>
            <p>We demonstrate quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear many-body systems on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting ground states of oxygen, calcium, and nickel isotopes. By combining a hard-core-boson representation of the nuclear shell model with a pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles ansatz, we achieve sub-percent relative error in the ground-state energies compared to noise-free statevector simulations. Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental realization of strong longitudinal (ZZ) coupling between two superconducting transmon qubits achieved solely through capacitive engineering. By systematically varying the qubit frequency detuning, we measure cross-Kerr inter-qubit interaction strengths ranging from 10 MHz up to 350 MHz, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously observed in similar capacitively coupled systems. In this configuration, the qubits enter a strong-interaction regime in which the excitation of one qubit inhibits that of its neighbor, demonstrating a dynamical blockade mediated entirely by the engineered ZZ coupling. Circuit quantization simulations accurately reproduce the experimental results, while perturbative models confirm the theoretical origin of the energy shift as a hybridization between the computational states and higher-excitation manifolds. We establish a robust and scalable method to access interaction-dominated physics in superconducting circuits, providing a pathway towards solid-state implementations of globally controlled quantum architectures and cooperative many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>Eliminating cryogenic operating requirements while preserving microsecond-scale quantum coherence and enabling CMOS scalability remains a central challenge for telecom quantum technologies. Addressing this, we introduce a CMOS-compatible quantum system comprising single-erbium-(Er)-ion qudits (five-level systems) operating across the visible and telecom C-band. Through innovative nanofabrication, we achieve self-aligned ion placement, enabling spatial isolation of single-Er ions and suppressing dephasing. We realize individually addressable single-Er-devices with record-long optical coherence times in the telecom C-band exceeding 500 {\mu}s at ambient conditions, a performance previously limited to vacuum conditions at temperatures over 900 times lower. Furthermore, we present the first demonstration of background-free, upconversion-enabled single-photon Er-emissions providing coherent, high-contrast optical readouts.

            <h2>Maximum precision charging of multi-qubit quantum batteries</h2>

            <p>Precision, robustness, and efficiency are crucial aspects in the design of quantum technologies. Here, we show how genuine quantum features, together with non-Gaussianity, can be the key elements to achieve the best of these three aspects during a quantum battery-charging process. Taking inspiration from a light-matter interaction paradigm, i.e., the Jaynes-Cummings model, we employ the Full Counting Statistics to study the stochastic exchanges of energy between an entire stack of qubits and a single-mode electromagnetic field (or mechanical oscillator). Our study allows to conclude that charging the battery through a sequential protocol involving a quantum non-Gaussian field state guarantees extremely high-performances in the charging process, whose precision is maximized even under sub-optimal operating conditions. These results highlight the potential of non-Gaussian quantum state charging to achieve a robust quantum precision advantage over Gaussian states of the field by suppressing detrimental quantum fluctuations, thus making it suitable to ultimate tasks for which a significant degree of accuracy is required.</p>

            <h2>Exact dynamics and bound states of a cavity coupled to a two-dimensional reservoir</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heng-Na Xiong, Da-Wei Ye, Yang Yang, Hongli Zhu, Yixiao Huang, Stefano Longhi, Fanxin Liu</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a robust scheme for quantum information storage based on bound states in a two-dimensional coupled-cavity array. When a target cavity is tuned to resonance with the array, a bound state in the continuum (BIC) emerges, coexisting with two conventional bound states outside the band. The resulting dynamics reflects a delicate interplay between these bound states, which can be fully captured through exact analytical solutions. In the weak-coupling regime, the BIC dominates, enabling perfect and persistent information storage. At stronger coupling, all bound states contribute, leading to oscillatory behavior and reduced storage fidelity. These results, valid at both zero and finite reservoir temperatures and further supported by a single-particle framework, reveal distinctive non-Markovian features in continuous-variable systems and highlight the potential of photonic lattices for scalable all-optical decoherence-free quantum memory platforms.</p>

            <h2>Squeezed-Light-Enhanced Multiparameter Quantum Estimation in Cavity Magnonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamza Harraf, Mohamed Amazioug, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>Improving multiparameter quantum estimation in magnonic systems via quantum noise suppression is a well-established and critical research objective. In this work, we propose an experimentally realistic scheme to improve the precision of simultaneously estimating different parameters in a cavity-magnon system by utilizing a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The OPA enhances the estimation precision by decreasing the most informative quantum Cramér-Rao bound, calculated employing the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). We show that when nonlinearity is introduced into the system, quantum noise is significantly suppressed. Our results show how different physical parameters influence multiparameter estimation precision and provide a detailed discussion of the associated physical mechanisms in the steady state. Our results focus on exploring practical Gaussian measurement schemes that can be realized experimentally. Besides, we further analyze the system's dynamics, comparing both the SLD quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the classical Fisher information (CFI) for both homodyne and heterodyne detection. This approach provides a robust foundation for multiparameter quantum estimation, offering significant potential for application in hybrid magnomechanical and optomechanical systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum-correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, constitute a fundamental resource for quantum technologies, enabling enhanced performance in quantum metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum communications. The practical deployment of such technologies requires squeezed-light sources that are compact, efficient, low-cost, and robust. Here we report a compact narrowband source of two-mode squeezed light at 795 nm based on four-wave mixing in hot 85Rb atomic vapor. The source is implemented in a small, modular architecture featuring a single fiber-coupled input, an electro-optic phase modulator combined with a single Fabry-Perot etalon for probe generation, and two free-space output modes corresponding to the signal and conjugate fields. Optimized for low pump power, the system achieves up to -8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing at an analysis frequency of 0.8 MHz with a pump power of only 300 mW. The intrinsic narrowband character of the generated quantum states makes this source particularly well suited for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking, including interfaces with atomic quantum memories. Our results establish a versatile and portable platform for low-SWaP squeezed-light generation, paving the way toward deployable quantum-enhanced technologies.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Construction of Two-Qubit Gates using the Symmetries of B Gate Equivalence Class</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Karthick Selvan, S. Balakrishnan</p>
            <p>Two applications of gates from the B gate equivalence class can generate all two-qubit gates. This local equivalence class is invariant under the mirror (multiplication with the SWAP gate) operation, inverse (Hermitian conjugate) operation, and the combined inverse and mirror operations. The last two symmetries are associated with the ability of a two-qubit gate to generate the two-qubit local gates and the SWAP gate in two applications. No single local equivalence class of two-qubit gates, except the B gate equivalence class, has these two symmetries. Only the planar regions of the Weyl chamber, describing the mirror operation, contain the local equivalence classes with either one of the two symmetries. We show that there exist one-parameter families of local equivalence classes on these planes, with and without the B gate equivalence class, such that each of them can be used to construct a parameterized universal two-qubit quantum circuit that involves only two nonlocal two-qubit gates. We also discuss the implementation of the gates from a few families of local equivalence classes on superconducting quantum computers for optimal generation of all two-qubit gates.</p>

            <p>Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Localizable Entanglement as an Order Parameter for Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Manna, Arul Lakshminarayan, Vaibhav Madhok</p>
            <p>We identify localizable entanglement (LE) as an order parameter for measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT). LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to being essentially constant for the volume-law phase thereby, discover an intrinsic length scale $\xi_E$ that diverges at the critical measurement probability $p_c$. While classical percolation transition captures successful transport across a network, MIPT as characterized by LE can be interpreted as quantifying the amount of quantum teleportation between two given nodes in a quantum circuit. Building on this insight, we propose a two-ancilla protocol that provides an experimentally accessible readout of entanglement redistribution across the transition.</p>

We show the protocol is sample-efficient and discuss applications, such as generalized suppression laws, efficient quantum kernel estimation for quantum machine learning, eigenspectrum estimation, and the characterization of multiphoton indistinguishability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Coffman, N. L. Diaz, Martin Larocca, Maria Schuld, M. Cerezo</p>
            <p>Recently, it has been shown that group Fourier analysis of quantum states, i.e., decomposing them into the irreducible representations (irreps) of a symmetry group, enables new ways to characterize their resourcefulness. Given that quantum phase spaces (QPSs) provide an alternative description of quantum systems, and thus of the group's representation, one may wonder how such harmonic analysis changes. In this work we show that for general compact Lie-group quantum resource theories (QRTs), the entire family of Stratonovich-Weyl quantum phase space representations-characterized by the Cahill-Glauber parameter $s$-has a clear resource-theoretic and signal-processing meaning. Specifically, changing $s$ implements a group Fourier filter that can be continuously tuned to favor low-dimensional irreps where free states have most of their support ($s=-1$), leave the spectrum unchanged ($s=0$), or highlight resourceful, high-dimensional irreps ($s=1$). As such, distinct QPSs constitute veritable group Fourier filters for resources. Moreover, we show that the norms of the QRT's free state Fourier components completely characterize all QPSs. Finally, we uncover an $s$-duality relating the phase space spectra of free states and typical (Haar-random) highly resourceful states through a shift in $s$. Overall, our results provide a new interpretation of QPSs and promote them to a signal-processing framework for diagnosing, filtering, and visualizing quantum resources.</p>

The mw fields experienced by NVs across the diamond culet was calculated from Rabi frequency and found to be higher and more uniform than those generated by an equivalent simple mw line, which will improve performance for wide-field, high-pressure measurements to probe spatial variations across samples under pressure.</p>

            <h2>Trainability-Oriented Hybrid Quantum Regression via Geometric Preconditioning and Curriculum Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyu Meng, Yangshuai Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have attracted growing interest for scientific machine learning, yet in regression settings they often suffer from limited trainability under noisy gradients and ill-conditioned optimization. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical regression framework designed to mitigate these bottlenecks. Our model prepends a lightweight classical embedding that acts as a learnable geometric preconditioner, reshaping the input representation to better condition a downstream variational quantum circuit. Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes. We further observe reduced structured errors that are visually correlated with oscillatory components on several scientific benchmarks, suggesting that geometric preconditioning combined with curriculum training is a practical approach for stabilizing quantum regression.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet repeated syndrome-measurement cycles dominate its spacetime and hardware cost. Although stabilizers commute and admit many valid execution orders, different schedules induce distinct error-propagation paths under realistic noise, leading to large variations in logical error rate. Outside of surface codes, effective syndrome-measurement scheduling remains largely unexplored. We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code.</p>

Contrary to quantum optics-based strategies, our approach harnesses a purely magnonic feature - the spin-wave nonlinearity - to generate magnon squeezing. This resource is used to prepare vacuum-squeezed states, as well as entangled states between modes of different magnets coupled via a microwave cavity. We propose methods to detect such states with classical methods, such as ferromagnetic resonance or local pickup coils, and quantify the required detection efficiency. We analytically solve the case of ellipsoidal yttrium iron garnet ferrimagnets, but our method applies to a vast range of shapes and sizes. Our work enables quantum magnonics experiments without single-magnon sources or detectors (qubits), thus bringing the quantum regime within reach of the wider magnonics community.</p>

            <p>The concept of random walk, in which particles or waves undergo multiple collisions with the microscopic constituents of a surrounding medium, is central to understanding diffusive transport across many research areas. However, this paradigm may break down in complex systems, where quantum interference and memory effects render the particle propagation anomalous, often fostering localization. Here we report on the observation of such anomalous dynamics in a minimal setting: an ultracold mass-imbalanced mixture of two fermionic gases in three dimensions. We release light impurities into a gas of heavier atoms and follow their evolution across different collisional regimes. Under strong interspecies interactions, by lowering the temperature we unveil a crossover from normal diffusion to subdiffusion. Simultaneously, a localized fraction of the light gas emerges, displaying no discernible dynamics over hundreds of collisions. Our findings, incompatible with the conventional Fermi-liquid picture, are instead captured by a model of an atom propagating through a (quasi-)static disordered landscape of point-like scatterers. These results highlight the key role of quantum interference in our mixture, which emerges as a versatile platform for exploring disorder-free localization phenomena.</p>

            <p>Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.</p>

            <p>As quantum machine-learning architectures mature, a central challenge is no longer their construction, but identifying the regimes in which they offer practical advantages over classical approaches. In this work, we introduce a framework for addressing this question in data-driven hadronic physics problems by developing diagnostic tools - centered on a quantitative quantum qualifier - that guide model selection between classical and quantum deep neural networks based on intrinsic properties of the data. Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the quantum qualifier identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models. Together, these results establish a principled framework for deploying quantum machine-learning tools in precision hadronic physics.</p>

            <p>Recently, researchers have proposed the Asymmetric Bethe ansatz method - a theoretical tool that extends the scope of Bethe ansatz-solvable models by "breaking" partial mirror symmetry via the introduction of a fully reflecting boundary. Within this framework, the integrability conditions which were originally put forward by Gaudin have been further generalized. In this work, building on Gaudin's generalized kaleidoscope model, we present a detailed investigation of the relationship between DN symmetry and its integrability. We demonstrate that the mathematical essence of integrability in this class of models is characterized by a newly proposed Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation. Furthermore, we show that the solvability of a model via the coordinate Bethe ansatz depends not only on the consistency relations satisfied by scattering matrices, but also on the model's boundary conditions and the symmetry of the subspace where solutions are sought. Through finite element method based numerical studies, we further confirm that Bethe ansatz integrability arises in a specific symmetry sector. Finally, by analyzing the algebraic structure of the Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation, we derive a series of novel quantum algebraic identities within the framework of quantum torus algebra.</p>

Then we incorporate the mosaic modulation and investigate the influence of quasiperiodic disorder on the two existing topological phases. Interestingly, it turns out that quasiperiodic disorder gives rise to multiple distinct effects for different fillings. At $2/3$ filling, the topological phase is significantly enhanced by the quasiperiodic disorder and topological Anderson insulator emerges. Based on the calculations of polarization and energy gap, we explicitly present corresponding topological phase diagram in the $\lambda-J$ plane. While for the $1/3$ filling case, % the topological phase is dramatically suppressed by the same quasiperiodic disorder. the quasiperiodic disorder dramatically compresses the topological phase, and strikingly, further induces the emergence of reentrant topological phase transitions instead. Furthermore, we verify the topological phase diagrams by computing the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility for both the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling cases. Our work exemplifies the diverse roles of quasiperiodic disorder in the modulation of topological properties, and will further inspire more research on the competitive and cooperative interplay between topological properties and quasiperiodic disorder.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation of general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with parity-violating fermionic Gaussian states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Kaicher, Joseph Vovrosh, Alexandre Dauphin, Simon B. Jäger</p>
            <p>We introduce equations of motion for a parity-violating fermionic mean-field theory (PV-FMFT): a numerically efficient fermionic mean-field theory based on parity-violating fermionic Gaussian states (PV-FGS). This work provides explicit equations of motion for studying the real- and imaginary-time evolution of spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with arbitrary geometries and interactions. We extend previous formulations of parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT) by including fermionic displacement operators in the variational Ansatz. Unlike PP-FMFT, PV-FMFT can be applied to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, describe quenches from arbitrary initial spin-1/2 product states, and compute local and non-local observables in a straight-forward manner at the same modest computational cost as PP-FMFT -- scaling as $O(N^3)$ in the worst case for a system of $N$ spins or fermionic modes. We demonstrate that PV-FMFT can exactly capture the imaginary- and real-time dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. We then study the post quench-dynamics of the one- and two-dimensional Ising model in presence of longitudinal and transversal fields with PV-FMFT and compute the single site magnetization and correlation functions, and compare them against results from other state-of-the-art numerical approaches. In two-dimensional spin systems, we show that the employed spin-to-fermion mapping can break rotational symmetry within the PV-FMFT description, and we discuss the resulting consequences for the calculated correlation functions. Our work introduces PV-FMFT as a benchmark for other numerical techniques and quantum simulators, and it outlines both its capabilities and its limitations.</p>

            <p>This work theoretically demonstrates that a spin qubit in a parabolic quantum wire driven by a bichromatic field exhibits a confinement-tunable synthetic gauge field, leading to novel Floquet topological phenomena. The study presents the underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, marked by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. Notably, the emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Additionally, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, including fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunneling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials has a versatile platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</p>

Away from the critical point, we discuss the interplay between the Laplacian and the Adjacency matrix in the whole parameter plane of the quantum Hamiltonian. These results allow us to paint the full picture of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model on graphs in the large $n$ limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Leifer, Cristhiano Duarte</p>
            <p>According to Aumann's celebrated theorem, rational agents cannot agree to disagree. In other words, agents who once shared a common prior probability distribution and who have common knowledge about their posteriors cannot assign different probability distributions to a given proposition. Common knowledge imposes strong restrictions on assigned probabilities. In fact, Aumann's agreement theorem was one of the first attempts to formalise and explore the role played by common knowledge in decision theory. Recently, the debate over possible (quantum) extensions of Aumann's results has resurfaced. This paper contributes to this discussion. First, we argue that agreeing to disagree is impossible in quantum theory. Secondly, by building on the quantum argument, we show that agreeing to disagree is also forbidden in any generalised probability theory. The upshot is that in its probabilistic version, the agreement theorem is a direct consequence of how we choose to condition upon acquiring new information.</p>

            <p>Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascués et al., New J. Phys. 10, 073013 (2008)], known as the Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the scalar extension [A. Pozas-Kerstjens et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new bilocal factorisation NPA hierarchy, prove its equivalence to a modified bilocal scalar extension NPA hierarchy, and characterise its convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario. We further explore its relations with the other known generalisations.</p>

We demonstrate this approach for the Fermi-Hubbard and transverse-field Ising models through numerical simulation. We then go on to explore avenues for its implementation on quantum computers using imaginary-time quantum dynamical emulation.</p>

            <p>Recently, feedback-based quantum algorithms have been introduced to calculate the ground states of Hamiltonians, inspired by quantum Lyapunov control theory. This paper aims to generalize these algorithms to the problem of calculating an eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian, assuming that the lower energy eigenstates are known. To this aim, we propose a new design methodology that combines the layer-wise construction of the quantum circuit in feedback-based quantum algorithms with a new feedback law based on a new Lyapunov function to assign the quantum circuit parameters. We present two approaches for evaluating the circuit parameters: one based on the expectation and overlap estimation of the terms in the feedback law and another based on the gradient of the Lyapunov function. We demonstrate the algorithm through an illustrative example and through an application in quantum chemistry. To assess its performance, we conduct numerical simulations and execution on IBM's superconducting quantum computer.</p>

            <p>Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) might be a promise application in the NISQ era. However, the limited trainability of VQAs could hinder their scalability to large problem sizes. In this paper, we improve the trainability of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) by utilizing convex interpolation to solve portfolio optimization. Based on convex interpolation, the location of the ground state can be evaluated by learning the property of a small subset of basis states in the Hilbert space. This enlightens naturally the proposals of the strategies of close-to-solution initialization, regular cost function landscape, and recursive ansatz equilibrium partition. The successfully implementation of a $40$-qubit experiment using only $10$ superconducting qubits demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposals. Furthermore, the quantum inspiration has also spurred the development of a prototype greedy algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that the hybridization of VQE and greedy algorithms achieves a mutual complementarity, combining the advantages of both global and local optimization methods. Our proposals can be extended to improve the trainability for solving other large-scale combinatorial optimization problems that are widely used in real applications, paving the way to unleash quantum advantages of NISQ computers in the near future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel Rajakumar, James D. Watson</p>
            <p>Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</p>

            <p>We establish improved complexity estimates of quantum algorithms for linear dissipative ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and show that the time dependence can be fast-forwarded to be sub-linear. Specifically, we show that a quantum algorithm based on truncated Dyson series can prepare history states of dissipative ODEs up to time $T$ with cost $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log(T) (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, which is an exponential speedup over the best previous result. For final state preparation at time $T$, we show that its complexity is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T} (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, achieving a polynomial speedup in $T$. We also analyze the complexity of simpler lower-order quantum algorithms, such as the forward Euler method and the trapezoidal rule, and find that even lower-order methods can still achieve $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ cost with respect to time $T$ for preparing final states of dissipative ODEs. As applications, we show that quantum algorithms can simulate dissipative non-Hermitian quantum dynamics and heat processes with fast-forwarded complexity sub-linear in time.</p>

            <h2>A Geometric Substructure for Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony John Bracken</p>
            <p>The description of a closed quantum system is extended with the identification of an underlying substructure enabling an expanded formulation of dynamics in the Heisenberg picture. Between measurements a ``state point" moves in an underlying multi-dimensional complex projective space with constant velocity determined by the quantum state vector. Following a measurement the point changes direction and moves with new constant velocity along one of several possible new orthogonal paths with probabilities determined by the Born Interpretation of the state vector. From this previously hidden substructure a new picture of quantum dynamics and quantum measurements emerges without violating existing no-gotheorems regarding hidden variables. A natural generalisation to a Riemannian substructure is proposed, determined by the entropy of the background environment. This leads to a suggestedinteraction between the substructure of quantum dynamics and the background gravitational field.</p>

            <p>We develop an extension of the Monte Carlo wave function approach that unambiguously identifies dynamical entanglement in general composite, open systems. Our algorithm performs tangential projections onto the set of separable states, leading to classically correlated quantum trajectories. By comparing this restricted evolution with the unrestricted one, we can characterize the entangling capabilities of quantum channels without making use of input-output relations. Moreover, applying this method is equivalent to solving the nonlinear master equation in Lindblad form introduced in \cite{PAH24} for two-qubit systems. We here extend these equations to multipartite systems of qudits, describing non-entangling dynamics in terms of a stochastic differential equation. We identify the impact of dynamical entanglement in open systems by applying our approach to several correlated decay processes. Therefore, our methodology provides a complete and ready-to-use framework to characterize dynamical quantum correlations caused by arbitrary open-system processes.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, autonomous stabilization of bosonic qubits has emerged as a promising approach for hardware-efficient protection of quantum information. However, applying these techniques to more complex encodings than the Schrödinger cat code requires exquisite control of high-order wave mixing processes. The challenge is to enable specific multiphotonic dissipation channels while avoiding unintended non-linear interactions. In this work, we leverage a genuine six-wave mixing process enabled by a near Kerr-free Josephson element to enforce dissipation of quartets of excitations in a high-impedance superconducting resonator. Owing to residual non-linearities stemming from stray inductances in our circuit, this dissipation channel is only effective when the resonator holds a specific number of photons. Applying it to the fourth excited state of the resonator, we show an order of magnitude enhancement of the state decay rate while only marginally impacting the relaxation and coherence of lower energy states. Given that stray inductances could be strongly reduced through simple modifications in circuit design and that our methods can be adapted to activate even higher-order dissipation channels, these results pave the way toward the dynamical stabilization of four-component Schrödinger cat qubits and even more complex bosonic qubits.</p>

This approach yields a compact expression for the system's propagator, which we show to be equivalent to existing formulations, such as the stochastic von Neumann equation (SVNE). A key advantage of our method is its generality: It can be extended to describe any open-system evolution defined on a suitable ordering contour. As a result, we adapt it to derive generalized versions of the SVNE that account for initial system-environment correlations, as well as stochastic equations that incorporate information about the statistics of energy flows in the environment. The insights offered by our technique further allow us to examine the nature of the noise processes appearing in the SVNE. We prove that its solution can be expressed in terms of a single physical noise, without any loss of information. Finally, we propose a semiclassical scenario in which this noise can be interpreted as arising from an initial measurement process on the environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juntai Zhou, Stefano Chessa, Eric Chitambar, Felix Leditzky</p>
            <p>A geometrically uniform (GU) ensemble is a uniformly weighted quantum state ensemble generated from a fixed state by a unitary representation of a finite group $G$. In this work we analyze the problem of discriminating GU ensembles from various angles. Assuming that the representation of $G$ is irreducible, we first show that a particular optimal measurement can be understood as the limit of weighted `pretty good measurements' (PGM). This naturally provides examples of state discrimination for which the unweighted PGM is provably sub-optimal. We extend this analysis to certain reducible representations, and use Schur-Weyl duality to discuss two particular examples of GU ensembles in terms of Werner-type and permutation-invariant generator states. For the case of pure-state GU ensembles we give a streamlined proof of optimality of the PGM first proved in [Eldar et al., 2004]. We use this result to give simplified proofs of the optimality of the PGM, along with expressions for the corresponding success probabilities, for two tasks: the hidden subgroup problem over semidirect product groups (first proved in [Bacon et al., 2005]), and port-based teleportation (first proved in [Mozrzymas et al., 2019] and [Leditzky, 2022]). Finally, we consider the $n$-copy setting and adapt a result of [Montanaro, 2007] to derive a compact and easily evaluated lower bound on the success probability of the PGM for this task. This result can be applied to the hidden subgroup problem to obtain a new proof for an upper bound on the sample complexity by [Hayashi et al., 2006].</p>

Remarkably, the GME shares the same operatorial structure as the Redfield equation and depends on a single kernel - a dressed environment correlation function accounting for all virtual interactions between the system and the environment. This simple structure grants a clear physical interpretation and makes the GME easy to simulate numerically, as we show by applying it to an open system based on two fermions coupled via superconductive pairing.</p>

            <p>Quantum computation and quantum simulation require a versatile gate set to optimize circuit compilation for practical applications. However, existing platforms are often limited to specific gate types or rely on parametric couplers to extend their gate set, which compromises scalability. Here, we propose a scalable quantum simulator with an extended gate set based on giant-atom three-level systems, which can be implemented with superconducting circuits. Unlike conventional small atoms, giant atoms couple to the environment at multiple points, introducing interference effects that allow exceptional tunability of their interactions. By leveraging this tunability, our setup supports both CZ and iSWAP gates through simple frequency adjustments, eliminating the need for parametric couplers. This dual-gate capability enhances circuit efficiency, reducing the overhead for quantum simulation. As a demonstration, we showcase the simulation of spin dynamics in dissipative Heisenberg XXZ spin chains, highlighting the setup's ability to tackle complex open quantum many-body dynamics. Finally, we discuss how a two-dimensional extension of our system could enable fault-tolerant quantum computation, paving the way for a universal quantum processor.</p>

            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme in a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, where a mechanical resonator couples to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through diagonalization of the full system's transition matrix in the Heisenberg picture. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the framework of open quantum system. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unsteady system states. Remarkably, the squeezing level can exceed the maximum achievable under system stability conditions. Furthermore, we show that our protocol is robust against systematic errors in both driving intensity and frequency, as well as against thermal Markovian noises. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <p>Quantum network applications impose a variety of requirements on entanglement resources in terms of rate, fidelity, latency, and more. The repeaters in the quantum network must combine good methods for entanglement generation, effective entanglement distillation, and smart routing protocols to satisfy these application requirements. In this work, we focus on entanglement distillation in a linear chain of quantum repeaters. While conventional approaches reuse the same distillation scheme over multiple hop lengths after entanglement swaps, we propose a novel adaptive quantum error correction (QEC) scheme that boosts end-to-end metrics. Specifically, depending on the network operating point, we adapt the code used in distillation over successive rounds to monotonically increase the rate while also improving fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using three codes, with parameters [[9,1,3]], [[9,2,3]], [[9,3,3]], and a new performance metric, efficiency, that incorporates both overall rate and fidelity. Since the minimum input fidelity for QEC-based distillation is high, we then extend our study to include non-QEC-based purification protocols, specifically DEJMPS since it outperforms others. We compare the performance of end-to-end DEJMPS against adapting from DEJMPS to QEC once DEJMPS improves the initial fidelity to the threshold for QEC. Through a refined efficiency metric, we illuminate the regime where QEC is beneficial. These results provide a detailed outlook for entanglement purification and distillation in first and second generation quantum repeaters.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Topology Principles behind Topological Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zou, Hoi-Kwong Lo</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for realizing scalable quantum technologies, and topological quantum error correction (TQEC) has emerged as the most experimentally advanced paradigm of QEC. Existing homological and topological code constructions, however, are largely confined to orientable two-manifolds with simple boundary conditions. In this work, we develop a unified algebraic-topological framework for TQEC based on homology, cohomology, and intersection theory, which characterizes exactly when an arbitrary-dimensional manifold (with or without boundary) can serve as a quantum memory, thereby extending the standard 2D homological-code picture to arbitrary dimension and to manifolds with boundary via Poincaré-Lefschetz duality. Building on this classification, we introduce concrete code families that exploit nontrivial topology beyond the planar and toric settings. These include ``3-torus code'' and higher-dimensional ``volume codes'' on compact manifolds with mixed $X$- and $Z$-type boundaries. We further give a topological construction of qudit TQEC codes on general two-dimensional cell complexes using group presentation complexes, which unifies and extends several known quantum LDPC and homological-product-like constructions within a single geometric language. Finally, we combine the theoretical framework with numerical simulations to demonstrate that changing only the global topology can yield improved logical performance at fixed entanglement resources. Taken together, our results provide a systematic set of topological design principles for constructing and analyzing TQEC codes across dimensions and boundaries, and they open new avenues for topology-aware fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>Efficient simulation of a quantum system generally relies on structural properties of the quantum state. Motivated by the recent results by Bakshi et al. on the sudden death of entanglement in high-temperature Gibbs states of quantum spin systems, we study the high-temperature Gibbs states of bounded-degree local fermionic Hamiltonians, which include the special case of geometrically local fermionic systems. We prove that at a sufficiently high temperature that is independent of the system size, the Gibbs state is a probabilistic mixture of fermionic Gaussian states. This forms the basis of an efficient classical algorithm to prepare the Gibbs state by sampling from a distribution of fermionic Gaussian states. As a contrasting example, we show that high-temperature Gibbs states of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model are not convex mixtures of Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime are a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated coherent interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of $21~\mathrm{\mu K}$ and read out with 77% single-shot fidelity. During the $6~\mathrm{ms}$ lifetime of the membrane the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective qubit detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the position noise spectrum of the membrane, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at $10~\mathrm{mK}$ and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</p>

            <p>Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) wave packets, known for their vortex structure and nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), are of great interest in various scientific fields. Here we study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a spatially-localized electron LG wave packet interacting with an inhomogeneous external electric field that violates the axial symmetry of the initial wave function. We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its qualitative form. We demonstrate that due to the interaction with the external field, the degenerate zeros of the initial wave function located on the $z$ axis split into multiple nondegenerate nodes in the transverse plane representing separate single-charge vortices. This mechanism resembles the analogous effects known in topological optics. These findings provide new insights into controlling and manipulating twisted matter beams and into their possible instabilities.</p>

            <h2>Learning quantum tomography from incomplete measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateusz Krawczyk, Pavel Baláž, Katarzyna Roszak, Jarosław Pawłowski</p>
            <p>We revisit quantum tomography in an informationally incomplete scenario and propose improved state reconstruction methods using deep neural networks. In the first approach, the trained network predicts an optimal linear or quadratic reconstructor with coefficients depending only on the collection of (already taken) measurement operators. This effectively refines the undercomplete tomographic reconstructor based on pseudoinverse operation. The second, based on an LSTM recurrent network performs state reconstruction sequentially. It can also optimize the measurement sequence, which suggests a no-free-lunch theorem for tomography: by narrowing the state space, we gain the possibility of more efficient tomography by learning the optimal sequence of measurements. Numerical experiments for a 2-qubit system show that both methods outperform standard maximum likelihood estimation and also scale to larger 3- and 4-qubit systems. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively learn the underlying geometry of multi-qubit states using this for their reconstruction.</p>

            <h2>Topologically noise robust network steering without inputs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhruv Baheti, Shubhayan Sarkar</p>
            <p>Quantum networks with independent sources allow observing quantum nonlocality or steering with just a single measurement per node of the network, or without any inputs. Inspired by the recently introduced notion of swap-steering, we consider here the triangle network scenario without inputs, where one of the parties is trusted to perform a well-calibrated measurement. In this scenario, we first propose a linear witness to detect triangle network swap-steering. Then, by using the correlations that achieve the maximum value of this inequality, and assuming that all the sources are the same, we can self-test the state generated by the sources and the measurements of the untrusted party. We then extend this framework to ring networks with an arbitrary number of nodes with one of them being trusted. Interestingly, this is the first example of a topologically robust, that is, one can observe steerability without assuming the network structure of the network, as well as noise-robust quantum advantage in a network. Additionally, by allowing the trusted party to perform tomography of their subsystems, we demonstrate that every bipartite entangled state will result in swap-steerable correlations in the ring network. For this purpose, we construct linear witnesses to detect ring network swap-steering corresponding to every bipartite entangled state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Ostner, Innocenzo De Marco, Christian Roubal</p>
            <p>Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on semiconductor laser phase noise are an inexpensive and efficient resource for true random numbers. Commercially available technology allows for designing QRNG setups tailored to specific use cases. However, it is important to constantly monitor whether the QRNG is performing according to the desired security standards in terms of independence and uniform distribution of the generated numbers. This is especially important in cryptographic applications. This paper presents a test scheme that helps to assess the acceptable operating conditions of a semiconductor laser for QRNG operation, using commonly accessible methods. This can be used for system monitoring, but crucially also to help the user choose the laser diode which better suits their needs. Two specific quality measurements, ensuring proper operation of the device, are explained and discussed. Setup-specific approaches for setting an acceptance boundary for these measures are presented and exemplary measurement data showing their effectiveness is given. By following the comprehensible procedure described here, a QRNG qualification environment tailored to specific security requirements can be reproduced.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Burshtein, Shachar Fraenkel, Moshe Goldstein, Ran Finkelstein</p>
            <p>Quantum devices comprised of elementary components with more than two stable levels - so-called qudits - enrich the accessible Hilbert space, enabling applications ranging from fault-tolerant quantum computing to simulating complex many-body models. While several quantum platforms are built from local elements that are equipped with a rich spectrum of stable energy levels, schemes for the efficient control and entanglement of qudits are scarce. Importantly, no experimental demonstration of multi-qudit control has been achieved to date in neutral atom arrays. Here, we propose a general scheme for controlling and entangling qudits and perform a full analysis for the case of qutrits, encoded in ground and metastable states of alkaline earth atoms. We find an efficient implementation of single-qudit gates via the simultaneous driving of multiple transition frequencies. For entangling operations, we provide a concrete and intuitive recipe for the controlled-Z (CZ) gate for any local dimension d, realized through alternating single qudit and entangling pulses that simultaneously drive up to two Rydberg transitions. We further prove that two simultaneous Rydberg tones are, in general, the minimum necessary for implementing the CZ gate with a global drive. The pulses we use are optimally-controlled, smooth, and robust to realistic experimental imperfections, as we demonstrate using extensive noise simulations. This amounts to a minimal, resource-efficient, and practical protocol for realizing a universal set of gates. Our scheme for the native control of qudits in a neutral atom array provides a high-fidelity route toward qudit-based quantum computation, ready for implementation on near-term devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peiyun Ge, Xiao Wang, Yu-Xin Chao, Rong Lu, Li You</p>
            <p>Coherent two-state oscillations are observed in numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-longitudinal-field Ising model (TLFIM) within false vacuum decay regimes. Starting from the false vacuum (a nearly fully polarized ferromagnetic state), we show that in moderate-sized systems, at resonances $h\approx 2J/n$ (with longitudinal field $h$, transverse field $J$, and an integer $n$), the expected decay can give way to coherent oscillations between the false vacuum and a symmetric resonant state. The oscillation frequency, i.e., the tunneling splitting, is observed notably to exhibit a superradiant-like $\sqrt{L}$ enhancement, as confirmed by a Schrieffer-Wolff analysis. In large chains, coherence remains for $n\gtrsim L/2$ due to bubble-size blockade and is robust against stronger transverse fields; for small $n$, long-range interactions can stabilize the oscillations by lifting multi-bubble degeneracies, establishing a robust many-body coherence mechanism beyond perturbative and finite-size limits.</p>

We demonstrate a controlled sixfold enhancement of SiV- photoluminescence (PL) under dual-color excitation, consisting of strong red (~660 nm) illumination combined with weak green (~530 nm) excitation. The measured dependencies of SiV- PL lifetime and intensity on excitation wavelength, together with the enhancement dependence on Ns concentration in the studied nanodiamonds, provide unambiguous evidence of the involvement of donor nitrogen in SiV-emission dynamics. Saturation curves and second-order PL intensity correlation measurements further indicate suppression of the population of the optically inactive SiV2- state upon the addition of green excitation. These results unlock a practical pathway toward engineering optically-controlled and scalable quantum emitters based on SiV-luminescent diamond nanoparticles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Berberich, Tobias Fellner, Robert L. Kosut, Christian Holm</p>
            <p>Errors occurring on noisy hardware pose a key challenge to reliable quantum computing. Existing techniques such as error correction, mitigation, or suppression typically separate the error handling from the algorithm analysis and design. In this paper, we develop an alternative, algorithm-centered framework for understanding and improving the robustness against errors. For a given quantum algorithm and error model, we derive worst-case fidelity bounds which can be efficiently computed to certify the robustness. We consider general error models including coherent and (Markovian) incoherent errors and allowing for set-based error descriptions to address uncertainty or time-dependence in the errors. Our results give rise to guidelines for robust algorithm design and compilation by optimizing our theoretical robustness measure. We demonstrate the practicality of the framework with numerical results on algorithm analysis and robust optimization, including the robustness analysis of a 50-qubit modular adder circuit.</p>

            <p>We study the problem of approximate state preparation on near-term quantum computers, where the goal is to construct a parameterized circuit that reproduces the output distribution of a target quantum state while minimizing resource overhead. This task is especially relevant for near-term algorithms where distributional matching suffices, but it is challenging due to stochastic outputs, limited circuit depth, and a high-dimensional, non-smooth parameter space. We propose CircuitTree, a surrogate-guided optimization framework based on Bayesian Optimization with tree-based models, which avoids the scalability and smoothness assumptions of Gaussian Process surrogates. Our framework introduces a structured layerwise decomposition strategy that partitions parameters into blocks aligned with variational circuit architecture, enabling distributed and sample-efficient optimization with theoretical convergence guarantees. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and variational tasks validate our theoretical insights, showing that CircuitTree achieves low total variation distance and high fidelity while requiring significantly shallower circuits than existing approaches.</p>

            <h2>Exact WKB method for radial Schrödinger equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Okuto Morikawa, Shoya Ogawa</p>
            <p>We revisit exact WKB quantization for radial Schrödinger problems from the modern resurgence perspective, with emphasis on how ``physically meaningful'' quantization paths should be chosen and interpreted. Using connection formulae at simple turning points and at regular singular points, we show that the nontrivial-cycle data give the spectrum. In particular, for the $3$-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the $3$-dimensional Coulomb potential, we explicitly compute a closed contour which starts at $+\infty$, bulges into the $r<0$ sector to encircle the origin, and returns to $+\infty$. Also we propose that the appropriate slice of the closed path provides a physical local basis at $r=0$, which is used by an origin-to-$\infty$ open path. Via the change of variables $r=e^x$ ($x\in(-\infty,\infty)$), the origin data are pushed to the boundary condition of convergence at $x\to-\infty$, which renders the equivalence between open-connection and closed-cycle quantization transparent. The Maslov contribution from the regular singularity is incorporated either as a small-circle monodromy which is justified in terms of renormalization group, or, equivalently, as a boundary phase; we also develop an optimized/variational perturbation theory on exact WKB. Our analysis clarifies, in radial settings, how mathematical monodromy data and physical boundary conditions dovetail, thereby addressing recent debates on path choices in resurgence-based quantization.</p>

Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Bostanci, Jonas Haferkamp, Chinmay Nirkhe, Mark Zhandry</p>
            <p>We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries. Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.</p>

            <p>Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices impose dual challenges on quantum circuit execution: limited qubit connectivity requires extensive SWAP-gate routing, while time-dependent decoherence progressively degrades quantum information. Existing qubit mapping algorithms optimize for hardware topology and static calibration metrics but systematically neglect transverse relaxation dynamics (T2), creating a fundamental gap between compiler decisions and evolving noise characteristics. We present TRAM (Transverse Relaxation Time-Aware Qubit Mapping), a coherence-guided compilation framework that elevates decoherence mitigation to a primary optimization objective. TRAM integrates calibration-informed community detection to construct noise-resilient qubit partitions, generates time-weighted initial mappings that anticipate coherence decay, and dynamically schedules SWAP operations to minimize cumulative error accumulation. Evaluated on Qiskit-based simulators with realistic noise models, TRAM outperforms SABRE by 3.59% in fidelity, reduces gate count by 11.49%, and shortens circuit depth by 12.28%, establishing coherence-aware optimization as essential for practical quantum compilation in the NISQ era.</p>

This construction broadens the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case of the convex being a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the folded Kantorovich cost and folded Wasserstein distances, and study their induced metric properties. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Franca [4], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. We also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [16] cost writes as a folded Kantorovich cost. Folded optimal transport therefore provides a unified framework for classical, semiclassical and separable quantum optimal transport.</p>

            <p>Quantum centric supercomputing (QCSC) framework, such as sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) holds immense promise toward achieving practical quantum utility to solve challenging problems. QCSC leverages quantum computers to perform the classically intractable task of sampling the dominant fermionic configurations from the Hilbert space that have substantial support to a target state, followed by Hamiltonian diagonalization on a classical processor. However, noisy quantum hardware produces erroneous samples upon measurements, making robust and efficient configuration-recovery strategies essential for a scalable QCSC pipeline. Toward this, in this work, we introduce PIGen-SQD, an efficiently designed QCSC workflow that utilizes the capability of generative machine learning (ML) along with physics-informed configuration screening via implicit low-rank tensor decompositions for accurate fermionic state reconstruction. The physics-informed pruning is based on a class of efficient perturbative measures that, in conjunction with hardware samples, provide a substantial overlap with the target state. This distribution induces an anchoring effect on the generative ML models to stochastically explore only the dominant sector of the Hilbert space for effective identification of additional important configurations in a self-consistent manner. Our numerical experiments performed on IBM Heron R2 quantum processors demonstrate this synergistic workflow produces compact, high-fidelity subspaces that substantially reduce diagonalization cost while maintaining chemical accuracy under strong electronic correlations. By embedding classical many body intuitions directly into the generative ML model, PIGen-SQD advances the robustness and scalability of QCSC algorithms, offering a promising pathway toward chemically reliable quantum simulations on utility-scale quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>In this work, we prove the strongest known lower bounds for QAC$^0$, allowing polynomially many gates and ancillae. Our main results show that: (1) Depth-3 QAC$^0$ circuits cannot compute PARITY, and require $\Omega(\exp(\sqrt{n}))$ gates to compute MAJORITY. (2) Depth-2 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions (e.g., PARITY) with non-negligible advantage, regardless of size. We develop new classical simulation techniques for QAC$^0$ to obtain our depth-3 bounds. In these results, we relax the output requirement of the quantum circuit to a single bit, making our depth $2$ approximation bound stronger than the previous best bound of Rosenthal (2021). This also enables us to draw natural comparisons with classical AC$^0$ circuits, which can compute PARITY exactly in depth $2$ (exp size). Our techniques further suggest that, for boolean total functions, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts. Our third result shows that depth $2$ QAC$^0$ circuits, regardless of size, cannot exactly synthesize an $n$-target nekomata state (a state whose synthesis is directly related to the computation of PARITY). This complements the depth $2$ exponential size upper bound of Rosenthal (2021) for approximating nekomatas (which is used as a sub-circuit in the only known constant depth PARITY upper bound). Finally, we argue that approximating PARITY in QAC0, with significantly better than 1/poly(n) advantage on average, is just as hard as computing it exactly. Thus, extending our techniques to higher depths would also rule out approximate circuits for PARITY and related problems</p>

            <p>Trapped-ion quantum computers based on segmented traps rely on shuttling operations to establish long-range connectivity between sub-registers. Qubit routing dynamically reconfigures qubit positions so that all qubits involved in a gate operation are co-located within the same segment, a task whose complexity increases with system size. To address this challenge, we propose a layout-independent compilation strategy based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we fine-tune pretrained LLMs to generate the required shuttling operations. We evaluate this approach on linear and branched one-dimensional architectures using quantum circuits of up to $16$ qubits. Our results show that the fine-tuned LLMs generate valid shuttling schedules and, in some cases, outperform previous shuttling compilers by requiring approximately $15\,\%$ less shuttle overhead. However, results degrade as the algorithms increase in width and depth. In future, we plan to improve LLM-based shuttle compilation by enhancing our training pipeline using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO).</p>

            <p>We introduce Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) as a finite, index-based algebraic framework for representing and manipulating quantum operators on Hilbert spaces of dimension $2^m$. In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits.</p>

We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter.

The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</p>

            <h2>Restoring Locality: The Heisenberg Picture as a Separable Description of Quantum Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sam Kuypers</p>
            <p>Local realism has been the subject of much discussion in modern physics, partly because our deepest theories of physics appear to contradict one another in regard to whether reality is local. According to general relativity, it is, as physical quantities (perceptible or not) in two spacelike separated regions cannot affect one another. Yet, in quantum theory, it has traditionally been thought that local realism cannot hold and that such effects do occur. This apparent discrepancy between the two theories is resolved by Everettian quantum theory, as first proven by Deutsch & Hayden (2000). In this paper, I will explain how local realism is respected in quantum theory and review the advances in our understanding of locality since Deutsch & Hayden's work, including the concept of local branching and the more general analysis by Raymond-Robichaud (2021)</p>

            <h2>Breaking the Orthogonality Barrier in Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenta Kasai</p>
            <p>Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded. In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the active part of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design circumvents conventional structural distance limitations induced by parent-matrix orthogonality, and enables the construction of quantum LDPC codes with large girth while avoiding latent low-weight logical operators. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.</p>

            <h2>Classical simulation of a quantum circuit with noisy magic inputs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiwon Heo, Sojeong Park, Changhun Oh</p>
            <p>Magic states are essential for universal quantum computation and are widely viewed as a key source of quantum advantage, yet in realistic devices they are inevitably noisy. In this work, we characterize how noise on injected magic resources changes the classical simulability of quantum circuits and when it induces a transition from classically intractable behavior to efficient classical simulation. We adopt a resource-centric noise model in which only the injected magic components are noisy, while the baseline states, operations, and measurements belong to an efficiently simulable family. Within this setting, we develop an approximate classical sampling algorithm with controlled error and prove explicit noise-dependent conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Our framework applies to both qubit circuits with Clifford baselines and fermionic circuits with matchgate baselines, covering representative noise channels such as dephasing and particle loss. We complement the analysis with numerical estimates of the simulation cost, providing concrete thresholds and runtime scaling across practically relevant parameter regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes N. Kriel, Emma C. King, Michael Kastner</p>
            <p>We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.</p>

Fermions are charged with respect to the field $A_{\sf{vac}}$, so lifting the Dirac equations from space-time ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ to phase space $T^*{\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ results in their solutions being localized in the space ${\mathbb R}^{p-1}$ or in space-time ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$.

First, we identify a smooth path of gapped symmetric Hamiltonians whose ground states transform inequivalently under the symmetry.

            <p>Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array, formed in a Si$_{0.972}$Ge$_{0.028}$ quantum well, manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1$\mu$m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baksa Kolok, György Frank, András Pályi</p>
            <p>Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. These quasiparticles are speculated to be the origin of chirality-induced spin selectivity and presumably can display exotic dynamic behaviors. However, direct experimental evidence of spin-phonon polarons has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests itself as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence or quantum sensing performance.</p>

We analyze their dependence on the system parameters, showing in particular how finite temperature and on-site energy asymmetry affect the entanglement and coherence properties of the system. Moreover, starting from a quantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of interactions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime, where thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann weight involving an effective temperature. We discuss the possibility of applying this effective description to other models in suitable regimes.</p>

            <p>Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance. Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate models that exploit potential quantum advantages.</p>

            <p>We investigate the formation of moire quasicrystal patterns in Bose gasses confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the total density wave amplitude exhibit the stage for the emergence of moire quasicrystal patterns, where the pattern formation is closely associated with the momenta of collective modes excited by the weak periodic drive. Through analyzing the radial and angular density wave amplitude, we find that these new collective modes are only coupled radially and cannot be decoupled eventually. The symmetry of quasicrystal patterns can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moire quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</p>

            <p>We use the transfer tensor method to analyze localization and transport in simple disordered systems, specifically the Anderson and Aubry-André-Harper models. Emphasis is placed on the memory effects that emerge when ensemble-averaging over disorder, even when individual trajectories are strictly Markovian. We find that transfer tensor memory effects arise to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called "outgoing-pseudoflux". This work establishes connections between theoretical research on dynamical maps and Markovianity and localization phenomena in physically realizable model systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate entanglement entropy between the pair of type II$_1$ algebras of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model given a chord state, its holographic interpretation as generalized horizon entropy; particularly in the (anti-)de Sitter ((A)dS) space limits of the bulk dual; and its connection with Krylov complexity. The density matrices in this formalism are operators in the algebras, which are specified by the choice of global state; and there exists a trace to evaluate their von Neumann entropy since the algebras are commutants of each other, which leads to a notion of algebraic entanglement entropy. We match it in triple-scaling limits to an area computed through a Ryu-Takayanagi formula in (A)dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at the asymptotic timelike or spacelike boundaries respectively; providing a first-principles example of holographic entanglement entropy for (A)dS$_2$ space. This result reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking and Gibbons-Hawking entropy formulas for specific entangling regions points, while it decreases for others. This construction does not display some of the puzzling features in dS holography. The entanglement entropy remains real-valued since the theory is unitary, and it depends on the Krylov spread complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state. At last, we discuss higher dimensional extensions.</p>

            <p>Strongly interacting many-body systems exhibit collective properties that emerge from complex correlations among microscopic degrees of freedom. These cooperative phenomena govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, with relevance ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum field theories describing fundamental aspects of our universe. Understanding such emergent dynamics from first principles remains one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation dynamics following quenches in 2D ferromagnetic quantum Ising systems implemented in an atomic Rydberg array. Our experiments reveal two distinct regimes: In the confined regime, we observe an energy-dependent cluster size, revealing large collective clusters exceeding ten spins. In contrast, the deconfined regime is characterized by kinetically constrained, avalanche-like nucleation dynamics involving the entire system. Our findings establish a new frontier for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays, enabling controlled exploration of non-equilibrium phenomena previously out of reach. Beyond advancing experimental capabilities, they provide fundamental insights into highly correlated processes with implications that reach from quantum magnetism and glassy dynamics to cosmological models of the early universe.</p>

            <p>A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</p>

Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds.

            <p>Creating precise timing devices at ultra-short time scales is not just an important technological challenge, but confronts us with foundational questions about timekeeping's ultimate precision limits. Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Elevator Codes: Concatenation for resource-efficient quantum memory under biased noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Shanahan, Diego Ruiz</p>
            <p>Biased-noise qubits, in which one type of error (e.g. $X$- and $Y$-type errors) is significantly suppressed relative to the other (e.g. $Z$-type errors), can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum error correction. Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $\eta \ge 7\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $\eta = 2 \times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir-Reza Negari, Subhayan Sahu, Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri, Timothy H. Hsieh</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the existence of an extended non-equilibrium critical phase, characterized by sub-exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), in the surface code subject to heralded random Pauli measurement channels. By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding.</p>

            <h2>Parent Hamiltonians for stabilizer quantum many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane Dooley</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have attracted considerable interest due to their role in weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems. We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>Charging a quantum battery from the Bloch sphere</h2>

            <p>We reconsider the quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics of the charging process of a simple, two-component quantum battery model made up of a charger qubit and a single--cell battery qubit. We allow for the initial quantum state of the charger to lie anywhere on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and find the generalized analytical expressions describing the stored energy, ergotropy and capacity of the battery, all of which depend upon the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner evocative of the quantum area theorem. The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations. Our theoretical groundwork may be useful for guiding forthcoming experiments in quantum energy science based upon coupled two-level systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures the sequential interactions between a thermal absorber and a long-lived coherent probe. The comb provides a causal, multi-time description of coherence transport, tracking how the probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations. Using a process-tensor formulation, we derive closed form expressions showing that interference between the two interaction windows generates a non-monotonic memory response that reflects a fundamental competition between the absorbers thermal population and its dynamical correlations. By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach is readily compatible with circuit-QED platforms and offers a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroo Azuma</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study the two-time Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities of a quantum optical model that appears in the Josephson-junction quantum bit (qubit) interacting with an external magnetic flux. This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger.</p>

            <p>We study the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA), which treat imaginarity as a resource in distributed scenarios. For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy. Our findings shed light on the role that off-resonant interactions have in the efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios.</p>

            <p>We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.</p>

            <p>Three-qubit gates are highly beneficial operations in quantum computing, enabling compact implementations of quantum algorithms and efficient generation of multipartite entangled states. However, realizing such gates with high fidelity remains challenging due to crosstalk, complex control requirements, and the overhead of parametric or tunable couplers. In this work, we propose and analyze the implementation of fast, high-fidelity three-qubit gates using giant atoms -- artificial atoms coupled to a waveguide at multiple spatially separated points. By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term quantum computers and quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Near-term quantum networks face a bottleneck due to low quantum communication rates. This degrades performance both by lowering operating speeds and increasing qubit storage time in noisy memories, making some quantum internet applications infeasible. One way to circumvent this bottleneck is multiplexing: combining multiple signals into a single signal to improve the overall rate. Standard multiplexing techniques are classical in that they do not make use of coherence between quantum channels nor account for decoherence rates that vary during a protocol's execution. In this paper, we first derive semiclassical limits to multiplexing for many-qubit protocols, and then introduce two techniques: single click quantum multiplexing and multi-server multiplexing. These can enable beyond-classical multiplexing advantages. We illustrate these techniques through three example applications: 1) entanglement generation between two asymetric quantum network nodes (i.e., repeaters or quantum servers with inequal memories), 2) remote state preparation between many end user devices and a single quantum node, and 3) remote state preparation between one end user device and many internetworked quantum nodes. By utilizing many noisy internetworked quantum devices instead of fewer low-noise devices, our multiplexing strategies enable new paths towards achieving high-speed many-qubit quantum network applications.</p>

            <p>This work presents the implementation of a fragment-based, quantum-centric supercomputing workflow for computing molecular electronic structure using quantum hardware. The workflow is applied to predict the relative energies of two conformers of the 300-atom Trp-cage miniprotein. The methodology employs wave function-based embedding (EWF) as the underlying fragmentation framework, in which all atoms in the system are explicitly included in the CI treatment. CI calculations for individual fragments are performed using either sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) for challenging fragments or full configuration interaction (FCI) for trivial fragments. To assess the accuracy of SQD for fragment CI calculations, EWF-(FCI,SQD) results are compared against EWF-MP2 and EWF-CCSD benchmarks. Overall, the results demonstrate that large-scale electronic configuration interaction (CI) simulations of protein systems containing hundreds or even thousands of atoms can be realized through the combined use of quantum and classical computing resources.</p>

            <p>Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved.

Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further suggests a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Meier, Yuri Minoguchi, Gianmichele Blasi, Géraldine Haack, Marcus Huber</p>
            <p>Creating precise timing devices at ultra-short time scales is not just an important technological challenge, but confronts us with foundational questions about timekeeping's ultimate precision limits. Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Elevator Codes: Concatenation for resource-efficient quantum memory under biased noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Shanahan, Diego Ruiz</p>
            <p>Biased-noise qubits, in which one type of error (e.g. $X$- and $Y$-type errors) is significantly suppressed relative to the other (e.g. $Z$-type errors), can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum error correction. Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $\eta \ge 7\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $\eta = 2 \times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.</p>

            <p>Wave packet revivals and fractional revivals are hallmark quantum interference phenomena that arise in systems with nonlinear energy spectra, and their signatures in expectation values of observables have been studied extensively in earlier work. In this article, we build on these studies and extend the analysis in two important directions. First, we investigate fractional revival dynamics in angular momentum observables, deriving explicit expressions for the time evolution of their moments and demonstrating that higher-order angular momentum moments provide clear and selective signatures of fractional revivals. Second, we examine classical analogs of quantum revival phenomena and elucidate structural similarities between quantum fractional revivals and recurrence behavior in representative classical systems. Using the Kerr-type nonlinear Hamiltonian as a paradigmatic model, we analyze the autocorrelation function, moment dynamics, and phase-space structures, supported by visualizations such as quantum carpets. Our results broaden the range of experimentally accessible diagnostics of fractional revivals and provide a unified perspective on revival phenomena across quantum and classical dynamical systems.</p>

We also find that an isotropic quantum emitter can be either reflective or transmissive to light depending on the waveguide polarisation at the emitter location, indeed in the zero loss limit such a system changes from 100% transmission to 100% reflection due to an infinitesimal polarisation rotation. An example case for a four level system is also considered, which is found to operate as a non-destructive parity measurement of the photon number.</p>

            <h2>Time-Dynamic Circuits for Fault-Tolerant Shift Automorphisms in Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Younghun Kim, Spiro Gicev, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman</p>
            <p>Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising approach for realizing low-overhead logical quantum memories. Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes. Furthermore, our work can lead to alternative syndrome extraction circuit designs, such as leakage removal protocols, providing a practical pathway to utilizing dynamic circuits that extend beyond surface codes towards qLDPC codes.</p>

            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing ground state energies of molecular systems. We implement VQE to calculate the potential energy surface of the hydrogen molecule (H$_2$) across 100 bond lengths using the PennyLane quantum computing framework on an HPC cluster featuring 4$\times$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80GB each). We present a comprehensive parallelization study with four phases: (1) Optimizer + JIT compilation achieving 4.13$\times$ speedup, (2) GPU device acceleration achieving 3.60$\times$ speedup at 4 qubits scaling to 80.5$\times$ at 26 qubits, (3) MPI parallelization achieving 28.5$\times$ speedup, and (4) Multi-GPU scaling achieving 3.98$\times$ speedup with 99.4% parallel efficiency across 4 H100 GPUs. The combined effect yields 117$\times$ total speedup for the H$_2$ potential energy surface (593.95s $\rightarrow$ 5.04s). We conduct a CPU vs GPU scaling study from 4--26 qubits, finding GPU advantage at all scales with speedups ranging from 10.5$\times$ to 80.5$\times$. Multi-GPU benchmarks demonstrate near-perfect scaling with 99.4% efficiency and establish that a single H100 can simulate up to 29 qubits before hitting memory limits. The optimized implementation reduces runtime from nearly 10 minutes to 5 seconds, enabling interactive quantum chemistry exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Kobayashi, Tatsuro Yuge</p>
            <p>We study the Fano effect in dissipative cavity quantum electrodynamics, which originates from the interference between the emitter's direct radiation and that mediated by a cavity mode. Starting from a two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir, we show that a quantum master equation previously derived within the Born-Markov approximation can be rederived by introducing a single auxiliary mode via pseudomode approach. We identify the corresponding spectral function of the system--environment interaction and demonstrate that it consists of a constant and a non-Lorentzian contribution forming the Fano profile. The constant term is shown to be essential for obtaining a Lindblad master equation and is directly related to the rate associated with this Fano interference. Furthermore, by applying Fano diagonalization to a common-environment setup including an explicit cavity mode, we independently derive the same spectral function in the strongest-interference regime. Our results establish a unified framework for describing the Fano effect in single-mode cavity QED systems and clarify its non-Markovian origin encoded in the spectral function.</p>

            <h2>Casimir interactions as a probe of broadband optical response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Calum F. Shelden, Jeremy N. Munday</p>
            <p>Casimir forces arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations and depend on the dielectric response of interacting materials across the entire frequency spectrum. Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response. Using supervised machine learning to invert Lifshitz theory, we determine the complex permittivity of a material over more than seven orders of magnitude in frequency from a single force-distance curve. We show that measurements at different separations selectively constrain distinct frequency ranges of the dielectric response, providing direct physical insight into how quantum fluctuations sample the electromagnetic spectrum. These results establish Casimir interactions as a physically constrained, broadband spectroscopic tool and open new opportunities for optical characterization in regimes inaccessible to conventional techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Fang, Jixuan Ruan, Sharanya Prabhu, Ang Li, Travis Humble, Dean Tullsen, Yufei Ding</p>
            <p>The transition to the fault-tolerant era exposes the limitations of homogeneous quantum systems, where no single qubit modality simultaneously offers optimal operation speed, connectivity, and scalability. In this work, we propose a strategic approach to Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures (HQA) that synthesizes the distinct advantages of the superconducting (SC) and neutral atom (NA) platforms. We explore two architectural role assignment strategies based on hardware characteristics: (1) We offload the latency-critical Magic State Factory (MSF) to fast SC devices while performing computation on scalable NA arrays, a design we term MagicAcc, which effectively mitigates the resource-preparation bottleneck. (2) We explore a Memory-Compute Separation (MCSep) paradigm that utilizes NA arrays for high-density qLDPC memory storage and SC devices for fast surface-code processing. Our evaluation, based on a comprehensive end-to-end cost model, demonstrates that principled heterogeneity yields significant performance gains. Specifically, our designs achieve $752\times$ speedup over NA-only baselines on average and reduce the physical qubit footprint by over $10\times$ compared to SC-only systems. These results chart a clear pathway for leveraging cross-modality interconnects to optimize the space-time efficiency of future fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mei-Qi Gao, Song-hai Li, Xun Li, Xingli Li, Jiong Cheng, Wenlin Li</p>
            <p>Recent studies have extensively explored chaotic dynamics in quantum optical systems through the mean-field approximation, which corresponds to an ideal, fluctuation-free scenario. However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations. These results provide a bidirectional validation of the quantum mechanical suppression of chaos.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maristella Crotti, Luca Razzoli, Luigi Giannelli, Giuseppe A. Falci, Giuliano Benenti</p>
            <p>We investigate the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime under environmental dissipation. The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions.</p>

            <p>Coupling mechanical motion to an optical resonator enables displacement measurements approaching the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, increasing the optomechanical coupling strength will inevitably lead to probing of the nonlinear response of the optical resonator. Thermal intermodulation noise (TIN) arising from the nonlinear mixing of thermomechanical motion can further increase the imprecision well above the SQL and has hitherto been canceled up to second order of nonlinearity via operation at the "magic detuning". In this work, we record the output of a membrane-in-the-middle microcavity system operating at room temperature and achieving high cooperativity, $C>n_\text{th}$, and apply a nonlinear transform that removes all orders of TIN, improving the mechanical signal-to-noise ratio by nearly 10 dB. Our results can be applied to experiments affected by third-order TIN, which we expect to be the dominating intrinsic source of noise in high-cooperativity room-temperature cavity optomechanical systems.</p>

            <p>Dicke states serve as a critical resource in quantum metrology, communication, and computation. However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the logarithmic-depth barrier by moving beyond the standard circuit model and leveraging global interactions (native to architectures such as neutral atoms and trapped ions). Specifically, utilizing unbounded CZ gates (i.e. within the QAC$^0$ circuit class), we offer circuits for exact computation of constant-weight Dicke states, using polynomial ancillae, and approximation of weight-1 Dicke states (i.e. $W$ states), using only constant ancillae. Granted additional access to the quantum FAN-OUT operation (i.e. upgrading to the QAC$_f^0$ circuit class), we also achieve exact preparation of arbitrary-weight Dicke states, with polynomial ancillae. These protocols distinguish the constant-depth capabilities of quantum architectures based on connectivity and offer a novel path toward resolving a long-standing quantum complexity conjecture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel E. Begg, Bishal K. Ghosh, Chong Zu, Chuanwei Zhang, Michael Kolodrubetz</p>
            <p>While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.</p>

The van Vleck expansion achieves superasymptotic accuracy up to an optimal orde; it ultimately breaks down due to resonant hybridization at a weak quasiperiodic potential, revealing that the observed localization is nonperturbative.</p>

            <p>Accurately capturing electron correlation in large-scale molecular systems remains one of the foremost challenges in quantum chemistry and a primary driver for the development of quantum algorithms. Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.</p>

            <p>Quantum chaotic systems exhibit certain universal statistical properties that closely resemble predictions from random matrix theory (RMT). With respect to observables, it has recently been conjectured that, when truncated to a sufficiently narrow energy window, their statistical properties can be described by an unitarily invariant ensemble, and testable criteria have been introduced, which are based on the scaling behavior of free cumulants. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture numerically in translationally invariant Heisenberg spin chains with spin quantum number $S =\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2}$. Combining a quantum-typicality-based numerical method with the exploitation of the system's symmetries, we study the spin current operator and find clear evidence of consistency with the proposed criteria in chaotic cases. Our findings further support the conjecture of the existence of RMT universality as manifest in the observable properties in quantum chaotic systems.</p>

The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed.

Our results show that direct EOFC spectroscopy mitigates transit-induced optical pumping distortion of the atomic lineshape, which is the dominant systematic temperature shift in alkali atom Doppler thermometry. Optical Bloch equation simulations of conventional and direct EOFC Doppler spectroscopy confirm that EOFC spectroscopy can use higher optical power to reduce statistical noise without optical pumping distortion. Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring.</p>

            <p>Cluster states and graph states in general offer a useful model of the stabilizer formalism and a path toward the development of measurement-based quantum computation. Their defining structure - the stabilizer group - encodes all possible correlations that can be observed during measurement. The measurement outcomes which are consistent with the stabilizer structure make error correction possible. Here, we leverage both properties to design feasible families of states that can be used as robust building blocks of quantum computation. This procedure reduces the effect of experimentally relevant noise models on the extraction of smaller entangled states from the larger noisy graph state. In particular, we study the extraction of Bell pairs from linearly extended graph states - this has the immediate consequence for state teleportation across the graph. We show that robust entanglement can be extracted by proper design of the linear graph with only a minimal overhead of the physical qubits. This scenario is relevant to systems in which the entanglement can be created between neighboring sites. The results shown in this work provide a mathematical framework for noise reduction in measurement-based quantum computation. With proper connectivity structures, the effect of noise can be minimized for a large class of realistic noise processes.</p>

            <p>The problem of determining the existence of a spectral gap in a lattice quantum spin system was previously shown to be undecidable for one [J. Bausch et al., "Undecidability of the spectral gap in one dimension", Physical Review X 10 (2020)] or more dimensions [T. S. Cubitt et al., "Undecidability of the spectral gap", Nature 528 (2015)]. In these works, families of nearest-neighbor interactions are constructed whose spectral gap depends on the outcome of a Turing machine Halting problem, therefore making it impossible for an algorithm to predict its existence. While these models are translationally invariant, they are not invariant under the other symmetries of the lattice, a property which is commonly found in physically relevant cases. This poses the question of whether the spectral gap problem could be decidable for Hamiltonians with stronger symmetry constraints. We give a negative answer to this question, in the case of models with 4-body (plaquette) interactions on the square lattice satisfying rotation, but not reflection, symmetry: rotational symmetry is not enough to make the problem decidable.</p>

Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus.

            <p>In classical systems, the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem establishes that resonant tori of integrable Hamiltonians are destroyed by any nonintegrable perturbation, whereas nonresonant tori are only deformed up to a finite value of the perturbation parameter. In this contribution, we identify a quantum analog of this differentiated sensitivity for one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians subject to periodic instantaneous kicks. After detecting quantum signatures of resonances in the participation ratio and in the quasiprobability phase-space distribution of Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we show that eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian exhibit greater sensitivity against the perturbation when they satisfy a resonant condition. The sensitivity is quantified through the fidelity between perturbed and unperturbed eigenstates. This differentiated sensitivity becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows. Our findings are supported by numerical results and insights from analytical calculations based on unitary perturbation theory. Although our analysis focuses on kicked models, the mechanism could be extended to more general periodic drivings, providing a preliminary step toward a quantum counterpart of the classical breaking of resonant tori.</p>

            <p>Quantum Mpemba effect describes an anomalous phenomenon of accelerated relaxation which is of fundamental interest in the field of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Conventional theories on this phenomenon strongly rely on the Born-Markovian approximation resulting in a Lindblad-type master equation whose evolution is governed by a Liouvillian superoperator. It has been demonstrated that exceptional points of the Liouvillian superoperator can induce the Mpemba effect in Markovian regimes. Moving beyond this Markovian limit, we here propose a mechanism for realizing the quantum Mpemba effect in a general non-Markovian relaxation process by means of non-Markovian exceptional points. We verify the feasibility of this mechanism within a dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator model, which is exactly solvable and experimentally practical. Providing new insight into the interesting non-equilibrium dynamics, our work paves a way to accelerate the transfer of energy and information in quantum systems.</p>
