            <h2>Intermediate Excited State Relaxation Dynamics of Boron-Vacancy Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Konrad, Mehran Kianinia, Lesley Spencer, Andreas Sperlich, Lukas Hein, Selin Steinicke, Igor Aharonovich, Vladimir Dyakonov</p>
            <p>The experimental identification of optically addressable spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride has opened new possibilities for quantum sensor technologies in two-dimensional materials and structures. Despite numerous fundamental and theoretical studies on the electronic structure of defects, the dynamics of the excited states are yet to be comprehensively investigated. The non-radiative relaxation pathways from the triplet excited states to the triplet ground states, particularly the one via a metastable intermediate state, remain largely presumed. A detailed identification, let alone a direct measurement of the rate constants, is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of the excited and intermediate states in the optical cycle under pulsed laser excitation in a broad temperature range. The focus is on the shelving intermediate state and resulting ground state spin polarization of an ensemble of optically pumped negatively charged boron vacancies. Our experiments show a relaxation time of 24 ns from the metastable state back to the ground state at room temperature. For low temperatures we find this time to approximately double - in accordance with a doubling of photoluminescence lifetime and intensity. Simulations show the evolution of the spin-populations in the five-level system and the polarization of the ground state depending on excitation rates. We thus optimize pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance sequences to account for the relaxation of the intermediate state. This yields significantly increased efficiency of the spin manipulation and hence, the sensitivity of the quantum sensor based on boron vacancies can be optimized considerably.</p>

            <h2>Boosting classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der Waals materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodan Lyu, Leevi Kallioniemi, Hongbing Cai, Liheng An, Ruihuan Duan, Shuin Jian Wu, Qinghai Tan, Chusheng Zhang, Ruihua He, Yansong Miao, Zheng Liu, Alexander Ling, Jesus Zúñiga Perez, Weibo Gao</p>
            <p>Understanding and controlling nonlinear processes is crucial for engineering light-matter interaction and generating non-classical light. A significant challenge in ultra-thin nonlinear materials is the marked diminution of the nonlinear conversion efficiency due to the reduced light-matter interaction length and, in many cases, the centrosymmetric crystalline structures. Here we relax these limitations and report a giant boost of classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der Waals materials. Specifically, with a metal-nonlinear material heterostructure we enhance classical second-harmonic generation in h-BN flakes by two-orders of magnitude. Moreover, we have engineered a metal-SiO2-nonlinear material heterostructure resulting in a remarkable two orders of magnitude augmentation of the quantum spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in NbOCl2 flakes. Notably, we demonstrate SPDC in a 16 nm-thick NbOCl2 flake integrated into the proposed structure. These findings simplify on-chip quantum state engineering and accelerate the use of van der Waals materials in nonlinear optoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing mechanical entanglement in molecular optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. B. Emale, C. Tchodimou, P. Djorwe, A.-H. Abdel-Aty, K.S. Nisar, S. G. Nana Engo</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme for enhancing bipartite quantum entanglement in a double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system incorporating an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Utilizing a set of linearized quantum Langevin equations and numerical simulations, we investigate the impact of the OPA on both optical-vibration and vibration-vibration entanglement. Our key findings reveal a counterintuitive trade-off: while the OPA significantly enhances vibration-vibration entanglement, a critical resource for quantum memories and transducers, it simultaneously suppresses optical-vibration entanglement. We demonstrate that maximal vibration-vibration entanglement is achieved when the molecular collective vibrational modes are symmetrically populated, providing a clear experimental guideline for optimizing entanglement sources. In particular, the vibration-vibration entanglement generated in our OPA-enhanced McOM system exhibits remarkable robustness to thermal noise, persisting at temperatures approaching \SI{e3}{\kelvin}, significantly exceeding conventional optomechanical systems, and highlighting the potential for room temperature quantum information processing. These results establish a promising theoretical foundation for OPA-enhanced McOM systems as a robust and scalable platform for quantum technologies, paving the way for future experimental implementations and advanced quantum information processing applications.</p>

            <h2>Genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality in the curved spacetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang-Wei Mi, Xiaofen Huang, Shao-Ming Fei, Tinggui Zhang</p>
            <p>The quantum Bell nonlocality plays a crucial role in quantum information processing. In this paper, we first obtain the quantitative analytical expression of the genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality of any 4-qubit quantum state. Then, we investigate and derive the genuine four-partite nonlocalities in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole and the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. In the Schwarzschild black hole, it is shown that the Hawking effect destroys the accessible genuine four-partite nonlocality while simultaneously having both detrimental and beneficial impacts on the inaccessible genuine four-partite nonlocality. Besides, we observe that the Hawking effect can generate the physically inaccessible genuine four-partite nonlocality for fermion fields in Schwarzschild black hole. This result shows that the genuine four-partite nonlocality can pass through the event horizon of black hole. Moreover, we also investigate the influence of the Hawking effect of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime on the genuine four-partite nonlocality of massless Dirac fields.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Features of the Thermal Two-Qubit Quantum Rabi Model in Ultra- and Deep-Strong Regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciro Micheletti Diniz, Gabriella G. Damas, Norton G. de Almeida, Celso J. Villas Boas, G. D. de Moraes Neto</p>
            <p>Quantum correlations and non-classical states are indispensable resources for advancing quantum technologies, and their resilience at finite temperatures is crucial for practical experimental implementations. The two-qubit quantum Rabi model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and has been extensively studied in cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. In this work, we investigate the persistence of quantum correlations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, we demonstrate the emergence of long-lived quantum correlations, even in the presence of thermal noise. Notably, we uncover striking phenomena arising from the interplay between detuning and deep strong-coupling: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit energy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is characterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, we show that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining quantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of quantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing quantum technologies operating under realistic, finite-temperature conditions.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xulong Wang, Guancong Ma</p>
            <p>The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other. However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes. Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in non-Hermitian phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Emission from Electronic Metastable Resonance States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Sivan, Milan Šindelka, Meir Orenstein, Nimrod Moiseyev</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that calculating the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable resonance states (states with finite lifetimes embedded in the continuum) requires considering transitions to all continuum states, not just to lower states. This holds even when the lifetimes of the metastable states are very long and might be effectively considered as bound states in the continuum. However, employing complex-scaling transformations, this computationally prohibitive task becomes feasible by utilizing methods originally designed for excited bound states for calculation of complex poles of the scattering matrix. As an illustrative example, these methods are applied to calculate the spontaneous emission decay rates of metastable resonance states in a double-barrier potential. The rapid numerical convergence of this approach highlights a new avenue for studying spontaneous emission from metastable states in real-life systems, particularly in many-electron systems, where calculation of the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable resonances (e.g., autoionization states) is computationally difficult, if not impossible, using the standard (Hermitian) formalism of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Entropic Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqiu Han, Xiaoyang Huang, Zohar Komargodski, Andrew Lucas, Fedor K. Popov</p>
            <p>Ordered phases of matter, such as solids, ferromagnets, superfluids, or quantum topological order, typically only exist at low temperatures. Despite this conventional wisdom, we present explicit local models in which all such phases persist to arbitrarily high temperature. This is possible since order in one degree of freedom can enable other degrees of freedom to strongly fluctuate, leading to "entropic order", whereby typical high energy states are ordered. Our construction, which utilizes interacting bosons, avoids existing no-go theorems on long-range order or entanglement at high temperature. We propose a simple model for high-temperature superconductivity using these general principles.</p>

            <h2>Glued tree lattices with only compact localized states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Osborne, Ciro Salcedo, Andrew A. Houck</p>
            <p>Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</p>

            <h2>Strongly coupled photonic molecules as doubly-coupled oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin C. Smith, Austin G. Nixon, David J. Masiello</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a first-principles theoretical model of strongly coupled photonic molecules composed of interacting dielectric cavities. We demonstrate the predictive power of this model, illustrating the ability to compute supermode eigenfrequencies, field profiles, and mode volumes, given only knowledge of the individual cavity mode profiles and dielectric background, without expensive electromagnetic simulations on the composite structure or numerical fitting. While our model affirms the phenomenological approach of modeling coupled cavity modes as simple coordinate-coupled oscillators in the weak coupling regime, we show that this intuition remarkably breaks down for strong coupling. Instead, we demonstrate that strongly coupled cavity modes are analogous to harmonic oscillators we term as doubly coupled, with interactions via electric and magnetic fields appearing as independent coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum couplings, respectively. We show that this distinction is not merely cosmetic, but gives rise to observable properties while providing deep insights into the physical mechanism behind previously observed phenomena, such as coupling induced frequency shifts. Finally, we illustrate that the complex interplay of these dual couplings suggests the possibility to realize exotic phenomena that typically only occur in the ultrastrong coupling regime, here predicted to emerge for comparably modest mode splittings within a regime we term pseudo-ultrastrong coupling.</p>

            <h2>The limits of knowledge in classical physics resemble the quantum uncertainty relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Theurel</p>
            <p>Building upon a recent analysis of the measurement process in Hamiltonian mechanics, this article investigates the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics -- the landscape of accessible probability distributions over phase space. I prove a thermodynamic limitation on the information that can be obtained about a classical system by means of observations: A direct analogue of the Robertson-Schrödinger quantum uncertainty relation controls the acquisition of information at the classical microscale. Central to this theorem is the notion of the "quality" of a measuring probe; a temperature-dependent strictly positive quantity that serves as a figure of merit of the probe, and that plays the role of $1/\hbar$ in the classical uncertainty relation. This study sets the stage for a new area of research into resource theories of classical measurement, in which high-quality measurements and high-information states of knowledge are the limited resources.</p>

            <h2>Quantum states with a positive partial transpose are useful for metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Géza Tóth, Tamás Vértesi</p>
            <p>We show that multipartite quantum states that have a positive partial transpose with respect to all bipartitions of the particles can outperform separable states in linear interferometers. We introduce a powerful iterative method to find such states. We present some examples for multipartite states and examine the scaling of the precision with the particle number. Some bipartite examples are also shown that possess an entanglement very robust to noise. We also discuss the relation of metrological usefulness to Bell inequality violation. We find that quantum states that do not violate any Bell inequality can outperform separable states metrologically. We present such states with a positive partial transpose, as well as with a non-positive positive partial transpose.</p>

            <h2>Qunity: A Unified Language for Quantum and Classical Computing (Extended Version)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Finn Voichick, Liyi Li, Robert Rand, Michael Hicks</p>
            <p>We introduce Qunity, a new quantum programming language designed to treat quantum computing as a natural generalization of classical computing. Qunity presents a unified syntax where familiar programming constructs can have both quantum and classical effects. For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked BQP subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of "garbage" outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity's syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms. We also detail how Qunity can be compiled into a low-level qubit circuit language like OpenQASM, proving the realizability of our design.</p>

            <h2>Constraints on Velocity and Spin Dependent Exotic Interaction at the Millimeter Scale with a Diamagnetic-levitated Force Sensor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenan Tian, Yuanji Sheng, Rui Li, Lei Wang, Peiran Yin, Shaochun Lin, Dingjiang Long, Chang-Kui Duan, Xi Kong, Pu Huang, Jiangfeng Du</p>
            <p>Light bosons, beyond the standard model and as prominent candidates for dark matter, can mediate velocity and spin dependent exotic interaction between electron spins and nucleons. At short ranges, it remains an open challenge to test this exotic interaction with high precision. Here, we present a method based on diamagnetic-levitated force sensor to detect the exotic interaction at the millimeter scale. Improved constraints for the coupling $g_A^e g_V^N$ are established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 mm to 1.5 mm. And the constraint $|g_A^e g_V^N| \leq 4.39 \times10^{-26}$ at $\lambda$ = 0.5 mm at the $95 \%$ confidence level, significantly surpasses previous results by more than three orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction. This system provides a platform for the exploration of dark matter.</p>

            <h2>ATP: Adaptive Threshold Pruning for Efficient Data Encoding in Quantum Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Afane, Gabrielle Ebbrecht, Ying Wang, Juntao Chen, Junaid Farooq</p>
            <p>Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer promising capabilities for complex data tasks, but are often constrained by limited qubit resources and high entanglement, which can hinder scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Threshold Pruning (ATP), an encoding method that reduces entanglement and optimizes data complexity for efficient computations in QNNs. ATP dynamically prunes non-essential features in the data based on adaptive thresholds, effectively reducing quantum circuit requirements while preserving high performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that ATP reduces entanglement entropy and improves adversarial robustness when combined with adversarial training methods like FGSM. Our results highlight ATPs ability to balance computational efficiency and model resilience, achieving significant performance improvements with fewer resources, which will help make QNNs more feasible in practical, resource-constrained settings.</p>

            <h2>Taking the temperature of quantum many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phillip C. Burke, Shane Dooley</p>
            <p>A quantum many-body scar is an eigenstate of a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian that exhibits two seemingly incongruous properties: its energy eigenvalue corresponds to a high temperature, yet its entanglement structure resembles that of low-temperature eigenstates, such as ground states. Traditionally, a temperature is assigned to an energy \emph{eigenvalue} through the textbook canonical temperature-energy relationship. However, in this work, we use the \emph{eigenstate subsystem temperature} -- a recently developed quantity that assigns a temperature to an energy eigenstate, based on the structure of its reduced density matrix. For a thermal state, the eigenstate subsystem temperature is approximately equal to its canonical temperature. Given that quantum many-body scars have a ground-state-like entanglement structure, it is not immediately clear that their eigenstate subsystem temperature would be close to their canonical temperature. Surprisingly, we find that this is the case: the quantum many-body scars have approximate ``knowledge'' of their position in the spectrum encoded within their state structure.</p>

            <h2>Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.</p>

            <h2>Theory-Independent Context Incompatibility: Quantification and Experimental Demonstration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariana Storrer, Patrick Lima, Ana C. S. Costa, Sebastião Pádua, Renato M. Angelo</p>
            <p>The concept of compatibility originally emerged as a synonym for the commutativity of observables and later evolved into the notion of measurement compatibility. In any case, however, it has remained predominantly algebraic in nature, tied to the formalism of quantum mechanics. Recently, still within the quantum domain, the concept of context incompatibility has been proposed as a resource for detecting eavesdropping in quantum communication channels. Here, we propose a significant generalization of this concept by introducing the notion of theory-independent context compatibility, a concept that is trivially satisfied by classical statistical theory but is found in conflict with quantum mechanics. Moreover, we propose a figure of merit capable of quantifying the degree of violation of theory-independent context incompatibility, and we experimentally demonstrate, using a quantum optics platform, that quantum systems can exhibit pronounced degrees of violation. Besides yielding a concept that extends to generic probabilistic theories and retrieving the notion of measurement incompatibility in the quantum domain, our results offer a promising perspective on evaluating the role of incompatibility in the manifestation of non-local correlations.</p>

            <p>A major challenge in quantum key distribution (QKD) with spatial modes lies in efficiently generating, manipulating, and detecting high-dimensional quantum states. Here, we present a hybrid QKD protocol that integrates entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure approaches, utilizing position and momentum correlations of photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion. Through projective measurements on one photon, the sender remotely prepares spatial modes at the receiver's end, simplifying state preparation. Detection is enhanced using advanced event-based single-photon cameras. Our scheme supports QKD in a 545-dimensional Hilbert space-the highest reported for spatial encoding-achieving 5.07 bits per coincidence in an optimized 90-mode configuration.

            <h2>Quantum error correction for long chains of trapped ions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Ye, Nicolas Delfosse</p>
            <p>We propose a model for quantum computing with long chains of trapped ions and we design quantum error correction schemes for this model. The main components of a quantum error correction scheme are the quantum code and a quantum circuit called the syndrome extraction circuit, which is executed to perform error correction with this code. In this work, we design syndrome extraction circuits tailored to our ion chain model, a syndrome extraction tuning protocol to optimize these circuits, and we construct new quantum codes that outperform the state-of-the-art for chains of about $50$ qubits. To establish a baseline under the ion chain model, we simulate the performance of surface codes and bivariate bicycle (BB) codes equipped with our optimized syndrome extraction circuits. Then, we propose a new variant of BB codes defined by weight-five measurements, that we refer to as BB5 codes, and we identify BB5 codes that achieve a better minimum distance than any BB codes with the same number of logical qubits and data qubits, such as $[[30, 4, 5]]$ and $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 codes. For a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, the $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code achieves a logical error rate per logical qubit of $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$, which is four times smaller than the best BB code in our baseline family. It also achieves the same logical error rate per logical qubit as the distance-7 surface code but using four times fewer physical qubits per logical qubit.</p>

            <h2>Towards robust variational quantum simulation of Lindblad dynamics via stochastic Magnus expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Cheng Huang, Hao-En Li, Yi-Cheng Wang, Guang-Ze Zhang, Jun Li, Han-Shi Hu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a novel and general framework for the variational quantum simulation of Lindblad equations. Building on the close relationship between nonlinearly unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in terms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples, including the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) with damping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model (RPM). The precision of the simulation can be systematically improved, and its reliability is confirmed even in the highly oscillatory regime. These methods are expected to extend their applicability beyond the particular systems analyzed in this study.</p>

            <p>Constructing an efficient and robust quantum memory is central to the challenge of engineering feasible quantum computer architectures. Quantum error correction codes can solve this problem in theory, but without careful design it can introduce daunting requirements that call for machines many orders of magnitude larger than what is available today. Bringing these requirements down can often be achieved by tailoring the codes to mitigate the specific forms of noise known to be present. Using a Quantinuum H1 quantum computer, we report on a robust quantum memory design using a concatenated code, with the low-level code designed to mitigate the dominant source of memory error, and a higher-level error correction scheme to enable robust computation. The resulting encoding scheme, known as a decoherence-free subspace quantum error correction code, is characterized for long probe times, and shown to extend the memory time by over an order of magnitude compared to physical qubits.</p>

            <h2>Fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise using Bacon-Shor codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long D. H. My, Akshaya Jayashankar, Prabha Mandayam, Hui Khoon Ng</p>
            <p>Designing efficient fault tolerance schemes is crucial for building useful quantum computers. Most standard schemes assume no knowledge of the underlying device noise and rely on general-purpose quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes capable of handling arbitrary errors. Biased-noise alternatives focus on only correcting a subset of some generic error basis (e.g., Pauli error basis), and lower resource needs by channeling the redundancy to dealing only with that subset. Yet, the most resource-efficient codes are expected to be those that directly target the specific noise process that afflicts the quantum device, rather than using a generic error-basis description. However, the question of whether such noise-adapted QEC protocols are amenable to fault-tolerant implementations remains largely unexplored. Here, we design a fault tolerance scheme based on the Bacon-Shor codes which can protect against amplitude-damping noise in the device. We construct a universal set of logical gadgets tolerant to multiple damping errors and estimate the fault tolerance threshold of our scheme. Our work thus establishes the possibility of achieving fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise using noise-adapted quantum codes, while highlighting some of the unique challenges that arise in this context.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing Non-Markovian Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sohail Reddy</p>
            <p>Characterizing non-Markovian quantum dynamics is essential for accurately modeling open quantum systems, particularly in near-term quantum technologies. In this work, we develop a structure-preserving approach to characterizing non-Markovian evolution using the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation, considering both linear and nonlinear formulations. To parameterize the master equation, we explore two distinct techniques: the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion, which provides an optimal basis representation of the dynamics, and neural networks, which offer a data-driven approach to learning system-environment interactions. We demonstrate our methodology using experimental data from a superconducting qubit at the Quantum Device Integration Testbed (QuDIT) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Our results show that while neural networks can capture complex dependencies, the KL expansion yields the most accurate predictions of the qubit's non-Markovian dynamics, highlighting its effectiveness in structure-preserving quantum system characterization. These findings provide valuable insights into efficient modeling strategies for open quantum systems, with implications for quantum control and error mitigation in near-term quantum processors.</p>

            <p>A promising platform for quantum information research relies on cavity coupled atomic spin-waves, enabling efficient operations such as quantum memories, quantum light generation and entanglement distribution. In this work, we study the strong coupling between non-classical collective spin excitations generated by Raman scattering in a cold $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic ensemble, and a single cavity mode. We report on an intracavity spin wave to single photon conversion efficiency of up to $\chi=0.75 \pm 0.02$ in the quantum domain, as evidenced by a violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Our work establishes a relationship between the retrieval of an atomic spin wave in the non-classical regime and the vacuum-Rabi splitting. We show that this relationship emerges within the efficiency spectrum, and we finally provide the optimal operational conditions to achieve the maximum intrinsic retrieval efficiency. Our data is well reproduced by simulations based on optical Bloch equations. This work deepens the understanding of cavity-enhanced spin wave readout and its potential applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum memories are essential for photonic quantum technologies, enabling long-distance quantum communication and serving as delay units in quantum computing. Hot atomic vapors using electromagnetically induced transparency provide a simple platform with second-long photon storage capabilities. Light-guiding structures enhance performance, but current hollow-core fiber waveguides face significant limitations in filling time, physical size, fabrication versatility, and large-scale integration potential. In this work, we demonstrate the storage of attenuated coherent light pulses in a cesium (Cs) quantum memory based on a 3D-nanoprinted hollow-core waveguide, known as a light cage (LC), with several hundred nanoseconds of storage times. Leveraging the versatile fabrication process, we successfully integrated multiple LC memories onto a single chip within a Cs vapor cell, achieving consistent performance across all devices. We conducted a detailed investigation into storage efficiency, analyzing memory lifetime and bandwidth. These results represent a significant advancement toward spatially multiplexed quantum memories and have the potential to elevate memory integration to unprecedented levels. We anticipate applications in parallel single-photon synchronization for quantum repeater nodes and photonic quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>Attosecond science relies on driving electrons after photoemission with the strong optical field of a laser pulse, representing an intense classical coherent state of light. Bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) is a quantum state of light intense enough to drive strong-field physics. However, its mean optical electric field is zero, suggesting that, in a semiclassical view, electrons should not experience strong driving. The question arises if and how this quantum state of light can generate attosecond science signatures in strong-field photoemission. Here we show that the key signatures of strong-field physics - the high energy plateau and the 10-$U_\mathrm{p}$-cut-off - also appear under BSV driving of a needle tip, but only when we post-select electron energy spectra on the individual photon number of each BSV pulse. When averaging over many BSV shots, we observe broad energy spectra featuring no plateau. This suggests that BSV-driven electrons behave as if driven by an ensemble of coherent states of light. Our findings bridge strong-field physics and quantum optics, offering insights into BSV and other quantum light states. Our work paves the way for electron quantum state engineering and the use of strongly driven electrons as quantum light sensors.</p>

            <p>Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junsen Wang, Xiangxiang Sun, Wei Zheng</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc M Dignam, Marco Liscidini</p>
            <p>We present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating the squeezing and antisqueezing spectrum in a channel waveguide side-coupled to a lossy ring resonator. Our approach first uses the semi-analytic evolution of the density matrix inside the ring up to the time where the squeezing is maximized. Then noting that a conservative approximate result for the squeezing can be obtained by ignoring the effect of the pump at later times, we calculate the free evolution of the field operators in the channel waveguide at all later times. We then calculate the quadrature squeezing spectrum in the waveguide, assuming that the measurement starts at the time when the squeezing in the ring is maximized. Using these results, we determine the optimum values for the pump pulse duration and amplitude and the ring-channel coupling for the pump and signal. We find that squeezing above 10 dB can be easily achieved in the channel for antisqueezing levels of less than 22 dB.</p>

            <h2>Exponential quantum speedups in quantum chemistry with linear depth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oskar Leimkuhler, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term quantum chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term quantum hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.</p>

            <h2>Dispersive regime of multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ayyash, Sahel Ashhab</p>
            <p>The dispersive regime of $n$-photon qubit-oscillator interactions is analyzed using Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an $n$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an $(n-1)$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional $2n$-photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing their desired nonlinear effects.</p>

Using these codes, our investigation aims to suppress memory loss errors that commonly affect systems such as atoms and microwave cavities, in contrast to dephasing errors in single-spin memories. We further discuss a physical implementation of such a quantum repeater comprising a microwave cavity and a superconducting transmon, capable of state engineering with high fidelities ($>97\%$) and logical Bell state measurements for successful entanglement swapping. As an alternative approach, we also discuss a realization in the all-optical domain.</p>

            <p>The Transformer model, renowned for its powerful attention mechanism, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various artificial intelligence tasks but faces challenges such as high computational cost and memory usage. Researchers are exploring quantum computing to enhance the Transformer's design, though it still shows limited success with classical data. With a growing focus on leveraging quantum machine learning for quantum data, particularly in quantum chemistry, we propose the Molecular Quantum Transformer (MQT) for modeling interactions in molecular quantum systems. By utilizing quantum circuits to implement the attention mechanism on the molecular configurations, MQT can efficiently calculate ground-state energies for all configurations. Numerical demonstrations show that in calculating ground-state energies for H_2, LiH, BeH_2, and H_4, MQT outperforms the classical Transformer, highlighting the promise of quantum effects in Transformer structures. Furthermore, its pretraining capability on diverse molecular data facilitates the efficient learning of new molecules, extending its applicability to complex molecular systems with minimal additional effort. Our method offers an alternative to existing quantum algorithms for estimating ground-state energies, opening new avenues in quantum chemistry and materials science.</p>

To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.</p>

In particular, the embedding techniques based on Hamiltonian simulation techniques enable the loading of matrices into quantum computers. A representative example of these methods is the Lloyd-Mohseni-Rebentrost protocol, which efficiently implements matrix exponentiation when multiple copies of a quantum state are available. However, this is a quite ideal set up, and in a realistic scenario, the copies are limited and the non-cloning theorem prevents from producing more exact copies in order to increase the accuracy of the protocol. Here, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation by introducing imperfect quantum copies, which significantly improve the performance of the LMR when the eigenvectors are known.</p>

            <h2>General protocols for the efficient distillation of indistinguishable photons</h2>

            <p>We introduce state-of-the-art protocols to distill indistinguishable photons, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, while using a modest amount of resources scaling only linearly in $n$. Our resource requirements are both significantly lower and have fewer hardware requirements than previous works, making large-scale distillation experimentally feasible for the first time. This efficient reduction of distinguishability error rates has direct applications to fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computation, potentially leading to improved thresholds for photon loss errors and allowing smaller code distances, thus reducing overall resource costs. Our protocols are based on Fourier transforms on finite abelian groups, special cases of which include the discrete Fourier transform and Hadamard matrices. This general perspective allows us to unify previous results on distillation protocols and introduce a large family of efficient schemes. We utilize the rich mathematical structure of Fourier transforms, including symmetries and related suppression laws, to quantify the performance of these distillation protocols both analytically and numerically. Finally, our work resolves an open question concerning suppression laws for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform: the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law if and only if $n$ is a prime power.</p>

            <p>Continuously monitoring a quantum system can strongly affect its properties and even suppress its coherent evolution via the Quantum Zeno effect. Well understood for few body quantum systems, the role of quantum measurements on entangled many-body states is still largely unexplored. Here we focus on one of the simplest entangled many-body state, arising via the Kondo effect in a strongly interacting quantum dot coupled to a metallic bath, and investigate the effect of continuous monitoring of the dot total charge. We show that the decay rate of an initially polarized spin displays a crossover from Kondo screening, with a decay rate controlled by interactions, to Quantum Zeno effect, with a decay rate which decreases with bare dissipation as the monitoring rate is increased. Remarkably we show that the long-lived Kondo state is robust to weak dissipation, as further confirmed by the dot spectral function which features a clear Kondo peak at finite dissipation, even in a regime where charge fluctuations and the associated Hubbard bands have been quenched by the monitoring protocol. We derive an effective model for the long-time dynamics which is described, at weak dissipation, by a non-Hermitian Kondo model with complex-valued spin exchange which is known to host exotic low-energy physics and a dissipative phase transition between Kondo and non-Kondo steady-state. Finally, as the dephasing is increased heating due to doublon production takes over and control the spin decay.</p>

We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).</p>

We assess the accuracy of the proposed method by reproducing known analytical results and demonstrate its capability to evaluate entanglement among $M$ parties for any given conventional or unconventional partitions of one- and two-dimensional spin systems, both near and at a quantum critical point. Our results establish the versatility of the variational approach in capturing different types of entanglement in various quantum systems, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. Our approach offers a powerful methodology for advancing research in quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and quantum field theory.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroo Azuma, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto</p>
            <p>We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we show that multiphoton JCHM reveals quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI), superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phases. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. If this conserved quantity diverges to infinity, this system is in the BEC phase. Exploring this system we observe the MI, BEC, and superfluid phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs although the two-photon JCHM MI phases are restricted to the small conserved quantity subspace. Contrastingly, only the superfluid and BEC phases arise in the three- and four-photon JCHMs (the MI phase is not observed).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Bo Hou, Rui-Zhe You, Di-Jia Zhang, Pengbo Li, Changchun Zhong</p>
            <p>Quantum transduction is a key technology for connecting different quantum technologies across varied frequencies. However, it remains a major challenge to overcome the high threshold for achieving positive capacity of traditional quantum transduction channels. Recently, an entanglement-assisted transducer was proposed based on a cavity-optic system [Opt. Quantum 2, 475 (2024)], where a modified bosonic loss channel was obtained, and the transduction efficiency can be enhanced by properly tuning the squeezing parameters. In this paper, we further identify three types of quantum channels enabled by this design, offering additional options for implementing the proposed transduction schemes. Compared to the transducers without entanglement assistance, the scheme also shows a great enhancement in the conversion bandwidth for achieving high quantum capacity, further increasing its value in practical applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters of single indistinguishable photons play a key role in quantum technologies. Among condensed matter systems, colloidal perovskite quantum dots have emerged as promising candidates, exhibiting high-purity single photon emission at room temperature and two-photon interference visibilities up to 0.5 at cryogenic temperatures. Achieving deterministic coupling of individual perovskite quantum dots to photonic structures is now a critical step towards harnessing cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) effects, such as the Purcell effect, to enhance single photon emission rate and indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic and reversible coupling of individual CsPbBr$_{3}$ perovskite quantum dots to a tunable, high-quality factor, low mode volume fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity at 10~\si{\kelvin}. By spatially and spectrally tuning the cavity mode in resonance with the quantum dot emission, we observe up to a twofold increase in single photon emission rates. We build on the original multiplet excitonic fine structure to assess the vacuum Rabi coupling strength ($g \simeq$ 40~\si{\micro eV}) from the shaping of the spectral profile of the emission upon increasing the electromagnetic confinement. This approach also made it possible to delineate the contributions of spectral diffusion and pure dephasing to the total linewidth of emission, paving the way to a fully optimized control of the emission properties of cavity coupled perovskite quantum dots.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guochun Du, Elena Jordan, Tanja E. Mehlstaeubler</p>
            <p>The integration of photonic components into surface ion traps provides a scalable approach for trapped-ion quantum computing, sensing, and metrology, enabling compact systems with enhanced stability and precision. However, the introduction of optical apertures in the trap electrodes can distort the trapping electric field. This can lead to excess micromotion (EMM) and ion displacement which degrade the performance of quantum logic operations and optical clocks. In this work, we systematically investigate the electric field distortion in a surface ion trap with integrated waveguides and grating couplers using Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We analyze methods to reduce these distortions by exploiting symmetries and transparent conductive oxide materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akib Karim, Shaobo Zhang, Muhammad Usman</p>
            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for preparing ground states in the current era of noisy devices. The classical component of the algorithm requires a large number of measurements on intermediate parameter values that are typically discarded. However, intermediate steps across many calculations can contain valuable information about the relationship between the quantum circuit parameters, resultant measurements, and noise specific to the device. In this work, we use supervised machine learning on the intermediate parameter and measurement data to predict optimal final parameters. Our technique optimises parameters leading to chemically accurate ground state energies much faster than conventional techniques. It requires significantly fewer iterations and simultaneously shows resilience to coherent errors if trained on noisy devices. We demonstrate this technique on IBM quantum devices by predicting ground state energies of H$_2$ for one and two qubits; H$_3$ for three qubits; and HeH$^+$ for four qubits where it finds optimal angles using only modeled data for training.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Zhang, Fu-Le Hao, Shi-Pu Gu, Xing-Fu Wang, Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng</p>
            <p>Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a typical multipartite cryptographic primitive, which is an important part of quantum communication network. Existing QSS protocols generally require basis selection and matching, which would increase the quantum resource consumption and classical communication round, and also face weak random security vulnerabilities. We propose an efficient hyperentanglement-based QSS protocol without the basis selection, in which the dealer and partners share a polarization-momentum hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and encode keys in the polarization degree of freedom (DOF). The dealer decodes the transmitted keys relying on the nonlocal hyperentanglement-assisted polarization GHZ state analysis. Our QSS protocol is unconditionally secure in theory. We develop simulation method to estimate its performance in practical environment. Compared with the QSS based on the GHZ state, our protocol has several advantages. First, it does not require basis selection and can completely distinguish eight polarization GHZ states, which can improve the utilization rate of entanglement resources to 100$\%$ and increase the key generation rate by an order of magnitude. Second, it only requires one round of classical communication, and thus can reduce key generation time by 69.4$\%$. Third, it can eliminate the weak random security vulnerabilities associated with the basis selection. Finally, our protocol only uses linear optical elements, which makes it practically feasible. Our QSS protocol has potential application in future quantum communication network.</p>

            <h2>Transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in monitored quantum dynamics with homogeneous unitary gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>We explore the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in systems evolved by quantum measurements and spatially homogeneous unitary gates. In models with temporally random and Floquet unitary gates, we find that the Lyapunov exponents typically converge to values independent of measurement outcomes and that spectral transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement transitions of ground states occur at the same measurement thresholds. Our results indicate that (i) randomness due to quantum measurements is enough, or equivalently, randomness of unitary gates is not essential, for the typical convergence of the Lyapunov spectrum and that (ii) the correspondence between the spectral transition and entanglement transition is ubiquitous in a wide range of systems. We also discuss why the typical convergence occurs, in light of the uniqueness and positive definiteness of stationary states in the completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamics averaged over random measurement outcomes.</p>

            <p>While quantum computers have the potential to perform a wide range of practically important tasks beyond the capabilities of classical computers, realizing this potential remains a challenge. One such task is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy. Certified randomness has many applications but is fundamentally impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations: a client generates quantum "challenge" circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute, and verifies the server's results. We analyze the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of $1.1\times10^{18}$ floating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify $71,313$ bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of today's quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Large-scale operations in quantum networks require efficient sorting of desired paths between nodes. In this article, we consider entanglement routing, which involves establishing an entanglement link between specific nodes in a large network of bosonic nodes. The networks are continuous-variable graph states built from finite squeezing and passive linear optics, shaped by complex network structures that mimic real-world networks. We construct a bipartite routing protocol with the specific goal of establishing a teleportation channel between two clients via passive optics operations locally operated by two different providers sharing the network. We provide criteria for extracting the aforementioned channel and, through the use of a derandomised evolutionary algorithm, extend the existing framework to study complex graph topologies.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Incompatible Observables with Quantum Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muchun Yang, Yibin Huang, D. L. Zhou</p>
            <p>The Heisenberg uncertainty principle imposes a fundamental restriction in quantum mechanics, stipulating that measuring one observable completely erases the information on its conjugate one, thereby preventing simultaneous measurements of incompatible observables. Quantum neural networks (QNNs) is one of the most significant applications on near-term devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we demonstrate that by implementing a multiple-output QNN that emulates a unital quantum channel, one can measure the expectation values of many incompatible observables simultaneously by Pauli-$Z$ measurements on distinct output qubits. We prove the existence of such quantum channel, derive analytical scaling constraints of the measured expectation values, and validate this framework by numerical simulations of observables learning tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals that it requires fewer copies of state when measuring some incompatible observables by the multiple-output QNNs, which demonstrates a resource efficiency advantage compared to separately applying projective measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joona V. Pankkonen, Lauri Ylinen, Matti Raasakka, Ilkka Tittonen</p>
            <p>Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are an essential tool in applying noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers to practical problems. VQCs are used as a central component in many algorithms, for example, in quantum machine learning, optimization, and quantum chemistry. Several methods have been developed to optimize VQCs. In this work, we enhance the performance of the well-known Rotosolve method, a gradient-free optimization algorithm specifically designed for VQCs. We develop two hybrid algorithms that combine an improved version of Rotosolve with the free quaternion selection (FQS) algorithm, which is the main focus of this study. Through numerical simulations, we observe that these hybrid algorithms achieve higher accuracy and better average performance across different ansatz circuit sizes and cost functions. For shallow variational circuits, we identify a trade-off between the expressivity of the variational ansatz and the speed of convergence to the optimum: a more expressive ansatz ultimately reaches a closer approximation to the true minimum, but at the cost of requiring more circuit evaluations for convergence. By combining the less expressive but fast-converging Rotosolve with the more expressive FQS, we construct hybrid algorithms that benefit from the rapid initial convergence of Rotosolve while leveraging the superior expressivity of FQS. As a result, these hybrid approaches outperform either method used independently.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum-classical approaches offer potential solutions to quantum chemistry problems, yet they often manifest as constrained optimization problems. Here, we explore the interconnection between constrained optimization and generalized eigenvalue problems through the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) excitation generators. Inspired by the generator coordinate method, we employ these UCC excitation generators to construct non-orthogonal, overcomplete many-body bases, projecting the system Hamiltonian into an effective Hamiltonian, which bypasses issues such as barren plateaus that heuristic numerical minimizers often encountered in standard variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Diverging from conventional quantum subspace expansion methods, we introduce an adaptive scheme that robustly constructs the many-body basis sets from a pool of the UCC excitation generators. This scheme supports the development of a hierarchical ADAPT quantum-classical strategy, enabling a balanced interplay between subspace expansion and ansatz optimization to address complex, strongly correlated quantum chemical systems cost-effectively, setting the stage for more advanced quantum simulations in chemistry.</p>

            <p>Finding a quantum battery model that demonstrates a quantum advantage while remaining feasible for experimental production is a considerable challenge. Here, a superconducting quantum battery (SQB) model that exhibits such an advantage is introduced. The model consists of two coupled superconducting qubits that interact during the unitary charging process while remaining in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. First, the model is described, evidence of the quantum advantage is provided, and then the fabrication process of the battery is discussed using superconducting qubits. Analytical expressions for the ergotropy, instantaneous power, and capacity of the SQB, as well as their connection to quantum coherence are derived. It is demonstrated that leveraging the collective effects of Josephson energies and the coupling energy between qubits allows for optimization, resulting in improved energy redistribution and a significant enhancement in charging efficiency. This work highlights the complexities of tuning system parameters, which increase the potential for work extraction from the SQB, providing a deeper understanding of the charging mechanisms involved. These findings can be applied to superconducting quantum circuit battery architectures, underscoring the feasibility of efficient energy storage in these systems. These results pave the way for proposals of new superconducting devices, emphasizing their potential for efficient energy storage.</p>

We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion.

            <p>The self-attention mechanism has revolutionized classical machine learning, yet its quantum counterpart remains underexplored in fully harnessing the representational power of quantum states. Current quantum self-attention models exhibit a critical limitation by neglecting the indispensable phase information inherent in quantum systems when compressing attention weights into real-valued overlaps. To address this fundamental gap, we propose the Quantum Complex-Valued Self-Attention Model (QCSAM), the first framework that explicitly leverages complex-valued similarities between quantum states to capture both amplitude and phase relationships. Simultaneously, we enhance the standard Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCUs) method by introducing a Complex LCUs (CLCUs) framework that natively supports complex-valued coefficients. This framework enables the weighting of corresponding quantum values using fixed quantum complex self-attention weights, while also supporting trainable complex-valued parameters for value aggregation and quantum multi-head attention. Experimental evaluations on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrate our model's superiority over recent quantum self-attention architectures including QKSAN, QSAN, and GQHAN, with multi-head configurations showing consistent advantages over single-head variants. We systematically evaluate model scalability through qubit configurations ranging from 3 to 8 qubits and multi-class classification tasks spanning 2 to 4 categories. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we establish the critical advantage of complex-valued quantum attention weights over real-valued alternatives.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emission of a qubit weakly coupled to a one-band coupled-cavity array where, due to an engineered gradient in the cavity frequencies, photons are effectively accelerated by a synthetic force F. For strong F, a reversible emission described by an effective Jaynes-Cummings model occurs, causing a chiral time-periodic excitation of an extensive region of the array, either to the right or to the left of the qubit depending on its frequency. For weak values of F instead, a complex non-Markovian decay with revivals shows up. This is reminiscent of dynamics induced by mirrors in standard waveguides, despite the absence of actual mirrors, and can be attributed to the finite width of the energy band which confines the motion of the emitted photon. In a suitable regime, the decay is well described by a delay differential equation formally analogous to the one governing the decay of an atom in a multi-mode cavity where the cavity length and time taken by a photon to travel between the two mirrors are now embodied by the amplitude and period of Bloch oscillations, respectively.</p>

            <p>Achieving unit fidelity in quantum state preparation is often impossible in the presence of environmental decoherence. While continuous monitoring and feedback control can improve fidelity, perfect state preparation remains elusive in many scenarios. Inspired by quantum speed limits, we derive an ultimate bound on the steady-state average fidelity achievable via continuous monitoring and feedback control. This bound depends only on the unconditional Lindblad dynamics, the maximum control Hamiltonian strength, and the target state. We also adapt the bound to the case of Markovian feedback strategies. We then focus on preparing Dicke states in an atomic ensemble subject to collective damping and dispersive coupling. By imposing additional constraints on control Hamiltonians and monitoring strategies, we derive tighter fidelity bounds. Finally, we propose specific control strategies and validate them using reinforcement learning. Benchmarking their performance against our theoretical bounds highlights the relevance and usefulness of these bounds in characterizing quantum feedback control strategies.</p>

            <p>Quantum devices can process data in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. To leverage this potential, many algorithms require the aid of a quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), i.e. a module capable of efficiently loading datasets (both classical and quantum) onto the quantum processor. However, a realization of this fundamental building block is still outstanding, since existing proposals require prohibitively many resources for reliable implementations, or are not compatible with current architectures. Moreover, present approaches cannot be scaled-up, as they do not allow for efficient quantum error-correction. Here we develop a QRAM design, that enables fast and robust QRAM calls, naturally allows for fault-tolerant and error-corrected operation, and can be integrated on present hardware. Our proposal employs a special quantum resource state that is consumed during the QRAM call: we discuss how it can be assembled and processed efficiently in a dedicated module, and give detailed blueprints for modern neutral-atom processors. Our work places a long missing, fundamental component of quantum computers within reach of currently available technology; this opens the door to algorithms featuring practical quantum advantage, including search or oracular problems, quantum chemistry and machine learning.</p>

            <p>We investigate a generalized quantum Rabi model (QRM) with two- and four-photon terms with respect to applications for non-linear critical quantum metrology. In the introduced model, the spectral collapse occurring in the standard two-photon QRM is stabilized by the presence of the quartic potential. The collapse is then transformed into a quantum phase transition, which occurs in the low-frequency limit of the light mode, whose remnant at finite ratio between qubit and mode frequencies can be applied to critically enhanced quantum metrology. We find that the four-photon term entails a much higher measurement precision compared to the standard two-photon QRM. The mechanism behind the higher precision can be traced to the different behavior of the ground state wave function as the system is tuned through the transition. As the standard two-photon QRM, despite the absence of the spectral collapse, our model allows for a finite preparation time for the probe state (PTPS).</p>

We demonstrate the formalism for locally constant positive curved surfaces, where we derive a new surface Green function that allows exact computation of the collective superradiant and subradiant states.

            <p>The manipulation of visible and near-infrared light at the single-photon level plays a key role in quantum communication systems where information is encoded into photonic degrees of freedom. In practical implementations, it is important to achieve this manipulation with high speeds, low loss, and low noise. In this work, we propose the use of terahertz~(THz) electric fields as a pump source for electro-optic modulation of single photons in bulk media. We demonstrate spectral modulations of single photons in the form of frequency translation and bandwidth manipulations as the terahertz field imparts linear and quadratic phases on the photons at various time delays within 1~ps. Our results show frequency translations exceeding 500~GHz at multi-THz modulation speeds and loss levels of $\approx$1~dB, complementing the current state-of-the-art electro-optic modulation techniques limited to speeds up to 100~GHz. The proposed approach leverages recent developments in terahertz generation techniques, introducing new avenues to manipulate non-classical light in an unexplored regime for quantum photonics.</p>

            <p>The remote entanglement of two atomic quantum memories through photonic interactions is accompanied by atomic momentum recoil. When the interactions occur at different times, such as from the random emission over the lifetime of the atomic excited state, the difference in recoil timing can expose ``which-path'' information and ultimately lead to decoherence. Time-bin encoded photonic qubits can be particularly sensitive to asynchronous recoil timing. In this paper we study the limits of entanglement fidelity in atomic systems due to recoil and other timing imbalances and show how these effects can be suppressed or even eliminated through proper experimental design.</p>

Featuring a compact and stable double-pass geometry using a corner-cube retroreflector, the source has a detected pair rate of 2.5 M pairs/s/mW with a Bell state fidelity of 94.1% +/- 2.1%. The quality and demonstrated performance of the source are suitable for deployment in entanglement-based quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>A Matrix Quantum Kinetic Treatment of Impact Ionization in Avalanche Photodiodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheikh Z. Ahmed, Shafat Shahnewaz, Samiran Ganguly, Joe C Campbell, Avik W. Ghosh</p>
            <p>Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs.</p>

            <p>The Entropic Uncertainty Relations (EUR) result from inequalities that are intrinsic to the Hilbert space and its dual with no direct connection to the Canonical Commutation Relations. Bialynicky-Mielcisnky obtained them in \cite{bialynicki1975uncertainty} attending Hilbert spaces with a Lebesgue measure. The analysis of these EUR in the context of singular Hilbert spaces has not been addressed. Singular Hilbert spaces are widely used in scenarios where some discretization of the space (or spacetime) is considered, e.g., loop quantum gravity, loop quantum cosmology and polymer quantum mechanics. In this work, we present an overview of the essential literature background and the road map we plan to follow to obtain the EUR in polymer quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mainak Dutta, Partha Nandi, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi</p>
            <p>We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sachin Kumar, Amit Kumar, S M Yusuf</p>
            <p>Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</p>

            <p>Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.</p>

Focusing on the 1D scenario of a string of particles, we develop an optimal protocol for quantum edge detection, efficiently computing its success probability through Schur-Weyl duality and semidefinite programming techniques. We analyze the behavior of the success probability as a function of the string length and local dimension, with emphasis in the limit of long strings. We present a protocol based on square root measurement, which proves asymptotically optimal. Additionally, we explore a mixed quantum change point detection scenario where the state of particles transitions from known to unknown, which may find practical applications in detecting malfunctions in quantum devices</p>

            <h2>Efficient and controlled symmetric and asymmetric Bell-state transfers in a dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model</h2>

            <p>Realizing efficient and controlled state transfer is necessary for implementing a wide range of classical and quantum information protocols. Recent studies have demonstrated that both asymmetric and symmetric state transfer can be achieved by encircling an exceptional point (EP) in non-Hermitian (NH) systems. However, the application of this phenomenon has been restricted to scenarios where an EP exists in single-qubit systems and is associated with a specific type of dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate efficient and controlled symmetric and asymmetric Bell-state transfers by modulating system parameters within a Jaynes-Cummings model while accounting for atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay. The effective suppression of nonadiabatic transitions enables a symmetric exchange of Bell states irrespective of the encircling direction. Furthermore, we report a counterintuitive finding: the presence of an EP is not indispensable for implementing asymmetric state transfers in NH systems. We achieve perfect asymmetric Bell-state transfers even in the absence of an EP, by dynamically orbiting around an approximate EP. Our work presents an approach to effectively and reliably manipulate entangled states with both symmetric and asymmetric characteristics, through the dissipation engineering in NH systems.</p>

            <p>The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</p>

            <p>Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.</p>

            <p>Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling.

            <p>Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Ren, Yuexun Huang, Zhiding Liang, Antonio Barbalace</p>
            <p>Quantum graph states are critical resources for various quantum algorithms, and also determine essential interconnections in distributed quantum computing. There are two schemes for generating graph states probabilistic scheme and deterministic scheme. While the all-photonic probabilistic scheme has garnered significant attention, the emitter-photonic deterministic scheme has been proved to be more scalable and feasible across several hardware platforms. This paper studies the GraphState-to-Circuit compilation problem in the context of the deterministic scheme. Previous research has primarily focused on optimizing individual circuit parameters, often neglecting the characteristics of quantum hardware, which results in impractical implementations. Additionally, existing algorithms lack scalability for larger graph sizes. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel compilation framework that partitions the target graph state into subgraphs, compiles them individually, and subsequently combines and schedules the circuits to maximize emitter resource utilization. Furthermore, we incorporate local complementation to transform graph states and minimize entanglement overhead. Evaluation of our framework on various graph types demonstrates significant reductions in CNOT gates and circuit duration, up to 52% and 56%. Moreover, it enhances the suppression of photon loss, achieving improvements of up to x1.9.</p>

The probe laser absorption at 780 nm is monitored in the presence of the two control lasers at 421 nm and 1003 nm. In comparison to the previously studied inverted $\Xi$ system, this system has a good signal-to-noise ratio even at room temperature with similar linewidth (around $10$~MHz). We also observe Autler-Towns splitting of the EIT due to the high power of probe and blue control lasers. For completeness and comparison, we also study the EIT in an inverted $\Xi$ system using $5S_{1/2}\rightarrow6P_{1/2}\rightarrow 69D_{3/2}$ transitions.</p>

            <p>Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) elevates the secure key rate from a linear to a square-root dependence on channel loss while preserving measurement-device-independent security. This protocol is uniquely positioned to enable global-scale quantum networks, even under extreme channel loss. While fiber-based TF-QKD implementations have advanced rapidly since its proposal, free-space realizations have remained elusive due to atmospheric turbulence-induced phase distortions. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of free-space TF-QKD over 14.2 km urban atmospheric channels, surpassing the effective atmospheric thickness -- a critical threshold for satellite compatibility. We achieve a secret key rate exceeding the repeaterless capacity bound, a milestone for practical quantum communication. Our approach eliminates the need for an auxiliary channel to stabilize a closed interferometer, instead leveraging open-channel time and phase control of optical pulses. This work represents a pivotal advance toward satellite-based global quantum networks, combining high-speed key distribution with inherent resistance to real-world channel fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly-polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. We verify our predicted complementary response in rubidium vapour cell experiments and through density matrix calculations. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic polarimetry for quantum metrological electric field characterization.</p>

            <p>In order to solve problems of practical importance, quantum computers will likely need to incorporate quantum error correction, where a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits. The large physical-qubit overhead typically associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches. Here, using a microfabricated superconducting quantum circuit, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance $d=5$. The bosonic cat qubits are passively protected against bit flips using a stabilizing circuit. Cat-qubit phase-flip errors are corrected by the repetition code which uses ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement. We realize a noise-biased CX gate which ensures bit-flip error suppression is maintained during error correction. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below threshold, with logical phase-flip error decreasing with code distance from $d=3$ to $d=5$. Concurrently, the logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat-qubit mean photon number. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average $1.75(2)\%$ for the distance-3 code sections, and $1.65(3)\%$ for the longer distance-5 code, demonstrating the effectiveness of bit-flip error suppression throughout the error correction cycle. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings allows us to use a hardware-efficient outer error correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes are a compelling paradigm for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are infamously known for their high demand on hardware, their extremely low key generation rates and their lack of security resulting from a need for trusted nodes which is implied by the absence of quantum repeaters. While they theoretically offer unlimited security, they are therefore practically limited in several regards. In this work we focus on the lack of options to guarantee an end-to-end security service with the currently available technology and infrastructure and propose a novel protocol. We find that one of the stumbling stones on the path towards an end-to-end security service guaranteed by quantum key distribution may be removed by using this protocol. Our proposal combines several parallel instances of twinfield QKD followed by classical postprocessing and communication to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret key. This hybrid approach improves the key rate and range w.r.t. to previous QKD approaches at a contained cost in security. We show that a coalition of intermediary nodes between Alice and Bob is needed to break the new scheme, sharply outperforming the trusted node approach in terms of security. Furthermore, the protocols do not require complex quantum measurements on Alice and Bob's sides, thus being truly end-to-end.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uluk Rasulov, Ilya Kuprov</p>
            <p>Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual jumble of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, amplifiers, and filters can and would distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next, and across the sample. Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering (RAW-GRAPE) framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions within the GRAPE optimisation loop, does not require filter function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles. The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Parameter Estimation for Detectors in Constantly Accelerated Motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Wang, Jialin Zhang, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum parameter estimation by analyzing the dynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the state parameters of accelerated detectors undergoing four different acceleration scenarios: linear, cusped, catenary, and circular motions. Our results show that QFI for the acceleration parameter converges to a nonnegative asymptotic value over long evolution times, with this value strongly dependent on the specific acceleration scenario. In contrast, QFI for the weight parameter degrades to zero over time. Notably, for sufficiently large accelerations, optimal precision in estimating the acceleration parameter can be achieved within a finite evolution time rather than requiring an infinitely long measurement duration. Comparing different scenarios, we find that for small accelerations relative to the detector's energy gap, linear motion provides the most accurate estimation of the weight parameter, introducing the least noise among all scenarios. However, for large accelerations, circular motion becomes the optimal scenario for estimating the weight parameter. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the estimation of the acceleration parameter, where circular motion is optimal both for small accelerations and for large accelerations over extremely long evolution times. These distinctions in QFI may provide a new tool for identifying the specific acceleration scenario of an accelerated detector.</p>

            <h2>Correlation versus dissipation in a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Masaya Nakagawa, Norio Kawakami</p>
            <p>We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</p>

            <h2>Emission photon statistics in collectively interacting dipole atom arrays in the low-intensity limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepak A. Suresh, F. Robicheaux</p>
            <p>We investigate the photon statistics of light emitted from a system of collectively interacting dipoles in the low-intensity regime, incorporating double-excitation states to capture beyond-single-excitation effects. By analyzing the eigenstates of the double-excitation manifold, we establish their connection to the accessible single-excitation eigenmodes and investigate the role of decay rates in shaping the initial-time photon correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau = 0)$ under different detection schemes. By interfering two beams of light that selectively address orthogonal eigenmodes, the photon emission statistics can be arbitrarily controlled. This can act as a tunable nonlinearity that enables both the enhancement and suppression of photon correlations, extending the operational intensity range for single-photon applications.</p>

            <h2>Recoil-induced errors and their correction in photon-mediated entanglement between atom qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Apolín, David P. Nadlinger</p>
            <p>Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of atom-field interaction inside a nonlinear Kerr-like medium filled optical cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naveen Kumar, Arpita Chatterjee</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of two two-level atoms interacting with a two-mode field inside an optical cavity, in presence of a nonlinear Kerr-like medium as well as the Stark shift. We derive the exact analytical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation that provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the system's quantum properties. To characterize the nonclassical features of the radiation field, we examine photon number distribution, second-order correlation function $g^2(0)$, squeezing properties, and Mandel's $Q_M$ parameter. These properties reveal significant insights into the quantum statistical behaviour of the field and its deviation from classicality under different interaction regimes. In addition, we quantify the atom-atom entanglement using linear entropy which captures the mixedness of the atomic subsystem and elucidates the interplay between atom-atom interactions. The results highlight the crucial role of nonlinear interactions and the Stark shift in shaping the quantum correlations and nonclassical phenomena of the system.</p>

            <h2>Controllable Single Photon Scattering via Coupling of Driven $Λ$ System with Topological Waveguide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gunjan Yadav, Madan Mohan Mahana, Tarak Nath Dey</p>
            <p>We investigate the coherent single photon scattering process in a topological waveguide coupled with a driven $\Lambda$ system. We derive an analytical expression for transmittance by using the scattering formalism for three different sublattice sites (A, B, and AB), which couples to the $\Lambda$ system. We have demonstrated that the system's response is topology-independent for A and B sublattice-site coupling and becomes topology-dependent for AB sublattice-site coupling. In a weak control field regime, the system behaves as a perfect mirror in all of these configurations. Upon the control field strength enhancement, the transmission spectrum evolves from Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) to Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) in A and B sublattice-site coupling. The manipulation of transmission from opaque to transparent holds the key mechanism of a single photon switch. Further, the topology-dependent AB sublattice configuration allows the sharper Fano line shape that is absent in topology-independent A and B sublattice configurations. This characteristic of the Fano line can be used as a tunable single-photon switch and for sensing external perturbations. Furthermore, our study paves the way for the robustness and tunability of systems with applications in quantum technologies such as quantum switches, sensors, and communication devices.</p>

            <h2>Dual-type dual-element atom arrays for quantum information processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanchuan Zhang, Jeth Arunseangroj, Wenchao Xu</p>
            <p>Neutral-atom arrays are a leading platform for quantum technologies, offering a promising route toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing. We propose a novel quantum processing architecture based on dual-type, dual-element atom arrays, where individually trapped atoms serve as data qubits, and small atomic ensembles enable ancillary operations. By leveraging the selective initialization, coherent control, and collective optical response of atomic ensembles, we demonstrate ensemble-assisted quantum operations that enable reconfigurable, high-speed control of individual data qubits and rapid mid-circuit readout, including both projective single-qubit and joint multi-qubit measurements. The hybrid approach of this architecture combines the long coherence times of single-atom qubits with the enhanced controllability of atomic ensembles, achieving high-fidelity state manipulation and detection with minimal crosstalk. Numerical simulations indicate that our scheme supports individually addressable single- and multi-qubit operations with fidelities of 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively, as well as fast single- and multi-qubit state readout with fidelities exceeding 99% within tens of microseconds. These capabilities open new pathways toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling repetitive error syndrome detection and efficient generation of long-range entangled many-body states, thereby expanding the quantum information toolbox beyond existing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Near-field dynamical Casimir effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renwen Yu, Shanhui Fan</p>
            <p>We propose the dynamical Casimir effect in a time-modulated near-field system at finite temperatures. The system consists of two bodies made of polaritonic materials, that are brought in close proximity to each other, and the modulation frequency is approximately twice the relevant resonance frequencies of the system. We develop a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics formalism to explore the produced Casimir flux, associated with the degenerate as well as non-degenerate two-polariton emission processes. We have identified flux contributions from both quantum and thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures, with a dominant quantum contribution even at room temperature under the presence of a strong near-field effect. We have found that the Casimir flux can be generated with a smaller modulation frequency through higher-order dynamical Casimir effect. We have conducted a nonclassicality test for the total radiative flux at finite temperatures, and shown that nonclassical states of emitted photons can be obtained for a high temperature up to $\sim 250\,$K. Our findings open an avenue for the exploration of dynamical Casimir effect beyond cryogenic temperatures, and may be useful for creating tunable nanoscale nonclassical thermal states.</p>

            <p>The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>A dual-operation mode SNSPD is proposed. In the conventional Geiger mode, the sensor operates at temperatures well below the critical temperature, Tc, working as an event counter without sensitivity to the number of photons impinging the sensor. In the calorimetric mode, the detector is operated at temperatures just below TC and displays calorimetric sensitivity in the range of 15 to 250 absorbed-photon energy equivalent for a photon beam with a wavelength of 515 nm. In this energy sensitive mode, photon absorption causes Joule heating of the SNSPD that becomes partially resistive without the presence of latching. Depending on the application, by tuning the sample temperature and bias current using the same readout system, the SNSPD can readily switch between the two modes. In the calorimetric mode, SNSPD recovery times shorter than the ones in the Geiger mode are observed, reaching values as low as 560 ps. Dual-mode SNSPDs may provide significant advancements in spectroscopy and calorimetry, where precise timing, photon counting and energy resolution are required.</p>

            <p>We study the control problem of regulating the purity of a quantum harmonic oscillator in a Gaussian state via weak measurements. Specifically, we assume time-invariant Hamiltonian dynamics and that control is exerted via the back-action induced from monitoring the oscillator's position and momentum observables; the manipulation of the detector measurement strengths regulates the purity of the target Gaussian quantum state. After briefly drawing connections between Gaussian quantum dynamics and stochastic control, we focus on the effect of inefficient detectors and derive closed-form expressions for the transient and steady-state dynamics of the state covariance. We highlight the degradation of attainable purity that is due to inefficient detectors, as compared to that dictated by the Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty relation. Our results suggest that quantum correlations can enhance the purity at steady-state. The quantum harmonic oscillator represents a basic system where analytic formulae may provide insights into the role of inefficient measurements in quantum control; the gained insights are pertinent to measurement-based quantum engines and cooling experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Saugbjerg Lange, Thomas Hansen, Lars Bojer Madsen</p>
            <p>The strong-field induced generation of nonclassical states of light is not only a subject of fundamental research but also has potential usage in quantum information science and technology. The emerging field of strong-field quantum optics has developed ways of generating nonclassical states of light from the process of high-harmonic generation (HHG) at much wider frequency ranges and intensities than is typical for quantum optics. So far, however, no clear nonclassical signal at a distinct and unambiguous frequency has been predicted. Here, we study the response from an exciton in a Mott-insulating system, using the extended Hubbard model. We find that the exciton plays a key role in the nonclassical response and generates squeezing at the exciton energy. We relate this nonclassical response to the nonvanishing time correlations of the current operator in the system. Our work defines a direction for experimental work to search for squeezed light from HHG in a spectrally confined region defined by the exciton energy.</p>

            <p>Recent years have witnessed a surge of experimental and theoretical interest in controlling the properties of matter, such as its chemical reactivity, by confining it in optical cavities, where the enhancement of the light-matter coupling strength leads to the creation of hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. However, ab initio calculations that account for the quantum nature of both the electromagnetic field and matter are challenging and have only started to be developed in recent years. We introduce a deep learning variational quantum Monte Carlo method to solve the electronic and photonic Schrödinger equation of molecules trapped in optical cavities. We extend typical electronic neural network wavefunction ansatzes to describe joint fermionic and bosonic systems, i.e. electron-photon systems, in a quantum Monte Carlo framework. We apply our method to hydrogen molecules in a cavity, computing both ground and excited states. We assess their energy, dipole moment, charge density shift due to the cavity, the state of the photonic field, and the entanglement developed between the electrons and photons. When possible, we compare our results with more conventional quantum chemistry methods proposed in the literature, finding good qualitative agreement, thus extending the range of scientific problems that can be tackled using machine learning techniques.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology offers the potential to surpass its classical counterpart, pushing the boundaries of measurement precision toward the ultimate Heisenberg limit. This enhanced precision is normally attained by utilizing large squeezed states or multi-particle entangled quantum states, both of which are often challenging to implement and prone to decoherence in real quantum devices. In this work, we present a versatile and on-demand protocol for deterministic parameter estimation that leverages two efficient state-transfer operations on a single bosonic mode. Specifically, we demonstrate this protocol in the context of phase estimation using the superposition of coherent states in the bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low average photon numbers of only up to 1.76, we achieve quantum-enhanced precision approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB. Importantly, we show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further enhanced on the fly by tailoring the input states, with different superposition weights, based on specific system constraints. The realization of this versatile and efficient scheme affords a promising path towards practical quantum-enhanced sensing, not only for bosonic cQED hardware but also readily extensible to other continuous-variable platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</p>

            <p>Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation promises new discoveries in physics, yet on most platforms its progress is limited by device connectivity constraints. Although SWAP gates can be inserted, their use increases circuit depth, which cannot be tolerated on current quantum computers and increases computational cost on fault-tolerant devices. Therefore, minimizing SWAP overhead is crucial, which, however, leads to a computational problem that is itself intractable. We establish a framework for analyzing spatiotemporally periodic circuits, which naturally occur in the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems and lattice gauge theories. We introduce and implement a method that leverages this framework to efficiently minimize SWAP overhead. It has a significant scaling advantage, outperforming leading general-purpose approaches by several orders of magnitude even for moderate system sizes. Remarkably, we find solutions with no SWAP overhead, opening the door for current quantum computers to explore geometrically frustrated magnetism.</p>

            <p>Electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a promising system for micro- and nano-scale magnetic sensing, due to their operation under ambient conditions, ease of placement in close proximity to sensing targets, and biological compatibility. At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits but can also potentially enhance sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room temperature quantum sensor. Our approach utilizes time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering in a two-dimensional ensemble of NV centers. Strikingly, we observe that the optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opening the door towards entanglement-enhanced practical quantum sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme B. Xavier, Jan-Åke Larsson, Paolo Villoresi, Giuseppe Vallone, Adán Cabello</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.</p>

            <p>Optically linked solid-state quantum memories such as color centers in diamond are a promising platform for distributed quantum information processing and networking. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have emerged as a crucial enabling technology for these systems, integrating quantum memories with efficient electrical and optical interfaces in a compact and scalable platform. Packaging these hybrid chips into deployable modules while maintaining low optical loss and resiliency to temperature cycling is a central challenge to their practical use. We demonstrate a packaging method for PICs using surface grating couplers and angle-polished fiber arrays that is robust to temperature cycling, offers scalable channel count, applies to a wide variety of PIC platforms and wavelengths, and offers pathways to automated high-throughput packaging. Using this method, we show optically and electrically packaged quantum memory modules integrating all required qubit controls on chip, operating at millikelvin temperatures with < 3dB losses achievable from fiber to quantum memory.</p>

            <h2>Distribution and Purification of Entanglement States in Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojie Fan, Yukun Yang, Himanshu Gupta, C.R. Ramakrishnan</p>
            <p>We consider problems of distributing high-fidelity entangled states across nodes of a quantum network. We consider a repeater-based network architecture with entanglement swapping (fusion) operations for generating long-distance entanglements, and purification operations that produce high-fidelity states from several lower-fidelity states. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, while there have been several works on fidelity-aware routing and incorporating purification into routing for generating EPs, this paper presents the first algorithms for optimal solutions to the high-fidelity EP distribution problem. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm for generating the optimal tree of operations to produce a high-fidelity EP, and an LP-based algorithm for generating an optimal collection of trees. Second, following the EP algorithms, this paper presents the first algorithms for the high-fidelity GHZ-state distribution problem and characterizes its optimality. We evaluate our techniques via simulations over NetSquid, a quantum network simulator.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Sturm, Adriana Pálffy</p>
            <p>The role of polarization in the topology of quantum emitter chains is investigated theoretically, whereby "polarization" refers to the transition dipole moments of the emitters. We show that, if the chain is zigzag-shaped, different topological phases can be realized by adjusting the polarization direction. It turns out that long-range dipole-dipole couplings weaken the bulk-boundary correspondence, but on the other hand give rise to higher-order topological phases with four observable edge modes. We also demonstrate how the polarization orientation can be used to define an additional dimension and simulate a synthetic Chern insulator. Our findings open up a way to actively switch between various topological phases within a single arrangement of quantum emitters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Liang Dong, Peng-Bo Li, Zongping Gong, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>Dissipative light-matter coupling plays a vital role in non-Hermitian physics, but it remains largely unexplored in waveguide QED systems. In this work, we find that by employing pseudo-Hermitian symmetry rather than anti-PT symmetry, the concept of dissipative coupling could be generalized and applied to the field of waveguide QED. This leads to a series of intriguing results, such as spontaneous breaking of pseudo-Hermitian symmetry across the exceptional points (EPs), level attraction between the bound states, and critical transition across the EPs for the population of quantum emitters in the bound state. Thanks to the tunability of photonic bands in crystal waveguides, we also demonstrate that dissipative light-matter coupling leads to the emergence of nonstandard third-order exceptional points with chiral spatial profiles in a topological waveguide QED system. This work provides a promising paradigm for studying non-Hermitian quantum phenomena in waveguide QED systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon B. Jäger</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of polarizable particles coupled to a lossy cavity mode that are transversally driven by a laser. Our analysis is performed in the regime where the cavity linewidth exceeds the recoil frequency by several orders of magnitude. Using a two-stage cooling protocol we show that the particles' kinetic energy can be reduced down to the recoil energy. This cooling protocol relies in its first stage on a high laser power such that the particles cool into a strongly self-organized pattern. This can be seen as a strongly magnetized state. In a second stage we adiabatically ramp down the laser intensity such that the particles' kinetic energy is transferred to their potential energy and the particles are ``demagnetized''. In this second stage we optimize the ramping speed which needs to be fast enough to avoid unwanted heating and slow enough such that the dynamics remains to good approximation adiabatic.</p>

            <p>In this work, we utilize a two-level atom and a ${\Lambda}$-type atom to link two identical waveguides, subsequently extending the model to a giant-atom configuration. Our analytical solutions and numerical simulations demonstrate that this setup can achieve single-photon isolation and nonreciprocal frequency conversion by tuning the atom-waveguide coupling strengths $g_i$, respectively. We also examine single-photon scattering in the giant-atom model within both the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The results reveal that ultranarrow scattering windows are induced by the phases ${\phi}_1$ and ${\phi}_2$ under specific conditions, making them well-suited for precise frequency conversion and sensing. Additionally, in the non-Markovian regime, the spectra exhibit irregular polygonal shapes, offering enhanced opportunities for exploring nonreciprocal frequency conversion in the off-resonant regime. Our work provides a new perspective on achieving optical nonreciprocity at the single-photon level in atom-waveguide systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Buchholz, Jonas M. Kübler, Bernhard Schölkopf</p>
            <p>Multi-armed bandits are one of the theoretical pillars of reinforcement learning. Recently, the investigation of quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems was started, and it was found that a quadratic speed-up (in query complexity) is possible when the arms and the randomness of the rewards of the arms can be queried in superposition. Here we introduce further bandit models where we only have limited access to the randomness of the rewards, but we can still query the arms in superposition. We show that then the query complexity is the same as for classical algorithms. This generalizes the prior result that no speed-up is possible for unstructured search when the oracle has positive failure probability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tulja Varun Kondra, Ray Ganardi, Alexander Streltsov</p>
            <p>In the classical regime, thermodynamic state transformations are governed by the free energy. This is also called as the second law of thermodynamics. Previous works showed that, access to a catalytic system allows us to restore the second law in the quantum regime when we ignore coherence. However, in the quantum regime, coherence and free energy are two independent resources. Therefore, coherence places additional non-trivial restrictions on the the state transformations, that remains elusive. In order to close this gap, we isolate and study the nature of coherence, i.e., we assume access to a source of free energy. We show that allowing catalysis along with a source of free energy allows us to amplify any quantum coherence present in the quantum state arbitrarily. Additionally, any correlations between the system and the catalyst can be suppressed arbitrarily. Therefore, our results provide a key step in formulating a fully general law of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Preconditioned Block Encodings for Quantum Linear Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leigh Lapworth, Christoph Sünderhauf</p>
            <p>Quantum linear system solvers like the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) require a block encoding of the system matrix $A$ within a unitary operator $U_A$. Unfortunately, block encoding often results in significant subnormalisation and increase in the matrix's effective condition number $\kappa$, affecting the efficiency of solvers. Matrix preconditioning is a well-established classical technique to reduce $\kappa$ by multiplying $A$ by a preconditioner $P$. Here, we study quantum preconditioning for block encodings. We consider four preconditioners and two encoding approaches: (a) separately encoding $A$ and its preconditioner $P$, followed by quantum multiplication, and (b) classically multiplying $A$ and $P$ before encoding the product in $U_{PA}$. Their impact on subnormalisation factors and condition number $\kappa$ are analysed using practical matrices from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Our results show that (a) quantum multiplication introduces excessive subnormalisation factors, negating improvements in $\kappa$. We introduce preamplified quantum multiplication to reduce subnormalisation, which is of independent interest. Conversely, we see that (b) encoding of the classical product can significantly improve the effective condition number using the Sparse Approximate Inverse preconditioner with infill. Further, we introduce a new matrix filtering technique that reduces the circuit depth without adversely affecting the matrix solution. We apply these methods to reduce the number of QSVT phase factors by a factor of 25 for an example CFD matrix of size 1024x1024.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of the quantum analog of entanglement between two electric circuits equivalent to two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Becca VanDrunen, Juanjuan Ren, Sebastian Franke, Stephen Hughes</p>
            <p>We present a general theory of gain-modified emission dynamics between two quantum emitters (two level systems) in a linear gain medium, demonstrating how gain modifies the usual radiative decay rates and inter-emitter coupling and decay rates, that are well known from purely lossy systems. We derive a Born-Markov master equation that shows explicitly how gain modifies the usual rates appearing for two emitters in a loss only medium, and introduces new gain terms. We then present Bloch equations in the bare state basis as well as a dressed-state basis (using superradiant and subradiant states). As an application of the theory, we show calculations for a fully three-dimensional metal dimer in a gain-compensated medium, containing two quantum emitters, and show explicit solutions in terms of the quasinormal modes, which easily allows one to obtain all the relevant decay rates. We study the modified decay dynamics, gain excited pumping, as well as the entanglement entropy and spectral emission. We also demonstrate how a breakdown of the weak excitation approximation in the presence of gain requires a careful treatment beyond a linear response, which yields non-trivial incoherent coupling terms that typically are not included in dipole-dipole coupling models or heuristic gain pumping models.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic Dicke model reveals the important role that counter-rotating wave terms play in the coupling between light and two level atoms. It is intriguing to generate the model to the strongly correlated many body case, where the competition between atomic interaction and light-atom coupling will induce exotic phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a periodically driving method for engineering an anisotropic Dicke model with strong dipole-dipole interaction between atoms based on Rydberg atom arrays in cavity. By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed. Our engineered model provides an extensive foundation for subsequet research of quantum simulation, many-body physics and even information processing.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons -- hybrid states of photons and excitons -- offer unique avenues for controlling electronic, optical, and chemical properties of materials. However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems. Here, we present an ab initio Green's function formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) wherein exciton-polaritons naturally emerge through an attractive, dynamical electron-hole exchange interaction. In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrico Di Benedetto, Alejandro Gonzalez-Tudela, Francesco Ciccarello</p>
            <p>Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel quantum algorithm that is able to classify a hierarchy of classes of imbalanced Boolean functions. The fundamental characteristic of imbalanced Boolean functions is that the proportion of elements in their domain that take the value $0$ is not equal to the proportion of elements that take the value $1$. For every positive integer $n$, the hierarchy contains a class of Boolean functions defined based on their behavioral pattern. The common trait of all the functions belonging to the same class is that they possess the same imbalance ratio. Our algorithm achieves classification in a straightforward manner as the final measurement reveals the unknown function with probability $1$. Let us also note that the proposed algorithm is an optimal oracular algorithm because it can classify the aforementioned functions with a single query to the oracle. At the same time we explain in detail the methodology we followed to design this algorithm in the hope that it will prove general and fruitful, given that it can be easily modified and extended to address other classes of imbalanced Boolean functions that exhibit different behavioral patterns.</p>

            <p>Over the last decades, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has risen as a promising solution for secure communications. However, like all cryptographic protocols, QKD implementations can open security vulnerabilities. Until now, the study of physical vulnerabilities in QKD setups has primarily focused on the optical channel. In classical cryptoanalysis, power and electromagnetic side-channel analysis are powerful techniques used to access unwanted information about the encryption key in symmetric-key algorithms. In QKD they have rarely been used, since they require an eavesdropper to have access to Alice or Bob's setups. However, security proofs of QKD protocols generally assume that these setups are secure, making it crucial to understand the necessary security measures to ensure this protection. In this work, we propose and implement a power side-channel analysis to a QKD system, by exploiting the power consumption of the electronic driver controlling the electro-optical components of the QKD transmitter. QKD modules typically require very precise electronic drivers, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Here, we show that the FPGA's power consumption can leak information about the QKD operation, and consequently the transmitted key. The analysis was performed on the QKD transmitter at the University of Padua. Our results are consistent and show critical information leakage, having reached a maximum accuracy of 73.35% in predicting transmitted qubits at a 100 MHz repetition frequency.</p>

Through an unsupervised learning and mutual information analysis on the classical dataset of measurement outcomes, we find that the information loss in the system, reflected by the increased entanglement, is compensated by an emergent structure in this classical dataset. Our findings highlight the crucial role of measurements and corresponding classical outcomes in capturing prethermal nonergodicity, offering a promising perspective for applications to other monitored quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that machine learning provides a powerful tool for discovering new approximate quantum error-correcting (AQEC) codes beyond conventional algebraic frameworks. Building upon results from hybrid quantum-classical learning, we construct two novel types of noise-strength-adapted (NSA) AQEC codes, namely a self-complementary code and a pair-complementary code, which can outperform conventional codes for amplitude damping (AD) noise. The 4-qubit self-complementary NSA code outperforms its non-NSA counterpart in fidelity and Knill-Laflamme condition violation. The pair-complementary code, which has no known non-NSA analog, achieves even better performance with higher-order loss suppression and better fidelity. We further generalize both approaches to families of NSA AD codes of arbitrary system size, as well as an NSA variant of the 0-2-4 binomial code for single-photon loss. Our results demonstrate that adaptation to noise strength can lead to significant improvements in error correction capability, and highlight how machine learning can help discover new valuable codes that may be missed through conventional algebraic approaches.</p>

            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich phase diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.</p>

            <h2>High-Efficiency, Low-Loss Floquet-mode Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier Characterization and Measurement</h2>

            <p>Advancing error-corrected quantum computing and fundamental science necessitates quantum-limited amplifiers with near-ideal quantum efficiency and multiplexing capability. However, existing solutions achieve one at the expense of the other. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first Floquet-mode traveling-wave parametric amplifier (Floquet TWPA). Fabricated in a superconducting-qubit process, our Floquet TWPA achieves minimal dissipation, quantum-limited noise performance, and broadband operation. Our device exhibits $>20$-dB amplification over a $3$-GHz instantaneous bandwidth, $<\!0.5$-dB average in-band insertion loss, and the highest-reported intrinsic quantum efficiency for a TWPA of $92.1\pm7.6\%$, relative to an ideal phase-preserving amplifier. When measuring a superconducting qubit, our Floquet TWPA enables a system measurement efficiency of $65.1\pm5.8\%$, the highest-reported in a superconducting qubit readout experiment utilizing phase-preserving amplifiers to the best of our knowledge. These general-purpose Floquet TWPAs are suitable for fast, high-fidelity multiplexed readout in large-scale quantum systems and future monolithic integration with quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iren Simko, Norah M. Hoffmann</p>
            <p>Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</p>

            <p>On-demand single-photon sources operating at telecom wavelengths are crucial for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate high-purity, indistinguishable single-photon generation in the telecom O-band from an InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot. We measured a single-photon purity of $g^2(0)=0.006(3)$ under aboveband excitation. Furthermore, we characterize two-photon interference via Hong-Ou-Mandel measurements and achieve a photon indistinguishability of $94.6\,\%$ with a temporal postselection of 100 ps time window and $5.58\,\%$ without temporal postselection. We measure a first-lens source efficiency of $\sim28\,\%$. These results highlight the potential of nanowire quantum dots as a promising source of telecom single photons for photonic quantum applications, offering deterministic positioning, efficient photon extraction, and scalable production.</p>

            <p>We consider a periodic quantum clock based on cooperative resonance fluorescence at zero temperature. In the quantum case, this system has an exact steady state and the limit cycle appears in conditional quantum dynamics under homodyne detection. We show that the intrinsic quantum phase diffusion on the limit cycle leads to fluctuations in the period. By simulating the stochastic master equation for homodyne detection, we extract the statistical properties of the clock period. We show that the precision of the clock satisfies the quantum-thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty relations. As energy dissipation increases, the clock quality improves, fully validating, in a quantum stochastic system, the link between energy dissipation and clock precision.</p>

            <h2>Tunable N-level EIT: Deterministic Generation of Optical States with Negative Wigner Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sutapa Ghosh, Alexey Gorlach, Chen Mechel, Maria V. Chekhova, Ido Kaminer, Gadi Eisenstein</p>
            <p>Strong optical nonlinearities are key to a range of technologies, particularly in the generation of photonic quantum states. The strongest nonlinearity in hot atomic vapors originates from electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which, while effective, often lacks tunability and suffers from significant losses due to atomic absorption. We propose and demonstrate an N-level EIT scheme, created by an optical frequency comb that excites a warm rubidium vapor. The massive number of comb lines simultaneously drive numerous transitions that interfere constructively to induce a giant and highly tunable cross-Kerr optical nonlinearity. The obtained third-order nonlinearity values range from $1.2 \times 10^{-7}$ to $7.7 \times 10^{-7}$ $m^2 V^{-2}$. Above and beyond that, the collective N-level interference can be optimized by phase shaping the comb lines using a spectral phase mask. Each nonlinearity value can then be tuned over a wide range, from 40\% to 250\% of the initial strength. We utilize the nonlinearity to demonstrate squeezing by self polarization rotation of CW signals that co-propagate with the pump and are tuned to one of the EIT transparent regions. Homodyne measurements reveal a quadrature squeezing level of 3.5 dB at a detuning of 640 MHz. When tuned closer to an atomic resonance, the nonlinearity is significantly enhanced while maintaining low losses, resulting in the generation of non-Gaussian cubic phase states. These states exhibit negative regions in their Wigner functions, a hallmark of quantum behavior. Consequently, N-level EIT enables the direct generation of photonic quantum states without requiring postselection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Cupo, Shuanglong Liu, Silas Hoffman, X.-G. Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng</p>
            <p>We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total spin of the metal center. By focusing on an $S = 1$ electronic spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate significant continuous tunability of the low-lying energy levels. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, all three energy levels retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field so that any pair of renormalized energy levels forms a clock transition qubit. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further physical insights are obtained from an effective Hamiltonian, derived analytically from second order van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgio Panichi, Sebastiano Corli, Enrico Prati</p>
            <p>Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QPINNs) integrate quantum computing and machine learning to impose physical biases on the output of a quantum neural network, aiming to either solve or discover differential equations. The approach has recently been implemented on both the gate model and continuous variable quantum computing architecture, where it has been demonstrated capable of solving ordinary differential equations. Here, we aim to extend the method to effectively address a wider range of equations, such as the Poisson equation and the heat equation. To achieve this goal, we introduce an architecture specifically designed to compute second-order (and higher-order) derivatives without relying on nested automatic differentiation methods. This approach mitigates the unwanted side effects associated with nested gradients in simulations, paving the way for more efficient and accurate implementations. By leveraging such an approach, the quantum circuit addresses partial differential equations -- a challenge not yet tackled using this approach on continuous-variable quantum computers. As a proof-of-concept, we solve a one-dimensional instance of the heat equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling PDEs. Such a framework paves the way for further developments in continuous-variable quantum computing and underscores its potential contributions to advancing quantum machine learning.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits have been used in the most advanced demonstrations of quantum information processing, and they can be manufactured at-scale using proven semiconductor techniques. This makes them one of the leading technologies in the race to demonstrate useful quantum computers. Since their initial demonstration, advances in design, fabrication, and materials have extended the timescales over which fragile quantum information can be stored and manipulated on superconducting qubits. Ubiquitous atomic-scale material defects have been identified as a primary cause of qubit energy-loss and decoherence. Here we study transmon qubits that exhibit energy relaxation times exceeding 2.5 ms. Even at these long timescales, our qubit energy loss is dominated by two level systems (TLS). We observe large variations in these energy-loss times that would make it extremely difficult to accurately evaluate and compare qubit fabrication processes and to perform studies that require precise measurements of energy loss. To address this issue, we present a technique for characterizing qubit quality factor. In this method, we apply a slowly varying electric field to TLS near the qubit to stabilize the measured energy relaxation time, enabling us to replace hundreds of hours of measurements with ones that span several minutes.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional integration technologies such as flip-chip bonding are a key prerequisite to realize large-scale superconducting quantum processors. Modular architectures, in which circuit elements are spread over multiple chips, can further improve scalability and performance by enabling the integration of elements with different substrates or fabrication processes, by increasing the fabrication yield of completed devices, and by physically separating the qubits onto distinct modules to avoid correlated errors mediated by a common substrate. We present a design for a multi-chip module comprising one carrier chip and four qubit modules. Measuring two of the qubits, we analyze the readout performance, finding a mean three-level state-assignment error of $9 \times 10^{-3}$ in 200 ns. We calibrate single-qubit gates and measure a mean simultaneous randomized benchmarking error of $6 \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with the coherence times of the qubits. Using a wiring-efficient static inter-module coupler featuring galvanic inter-chip transitions, we demonstrate a controlled-Z two-qubit gate in 100 ns with an error of $7 \times 10^{-3}$ extracted from interleaved randomized benchmarking. Three-dimensional integration, as presented here, will continue to contribute to improving the performance of gates and readout as well as increasing the qubit count in future superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Noisy dynamics of Gaussian entanglement: a transient bound entangled phase before separability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gurvir Singh, Saptarshi Roy, Arvind</p>
            <p>We discover a new class of Gaussian bound entangled states of four-mode continuous-variable systems. These states appear as a transient phase when certain NPT-entangled Gaussian states are evolved under a noisy environment. A thermal bath comprising of harmonic oscillators is allowed to interact with one or modes of the system and a wide variety of initial Gaussian entangled (NPT as well as PPT) states are studied. The robustness of entanglement is defined as the time duration for which the entanglement of the initial state is preserved under the noisy dynamics. We access the separability by utilizing standard semi-definite programming techniques. While most states lose their entanglement after a certain time across all bi-partitions, an exception is observed for a three-parameter family of states which we call the generalized four-mode squeezed vacuum (gFMSV) states, which transitions to a bound entangled state, and remains so for a finite window of time. This dynamical onset of bound entanglement in continuous-variable systems is the central observation of our work. We carry out the analysis for Haar-random four-mode states (both pure and mixed) to scan the state space for transient bound entangled phase</p>

Our results demonstrate that SPACS-based postselected weak measurements can outperform conventional measurement schemes in terms of precision. Additionally, we explicitly introduced an alternative weak measurement method commonly applied in dispersive light-atom interactions. Our work offers a new way for addressing fundamental issues in quantum precision measurement based on photon statistics, and it provides a method for extracting the phase and phase shifts of radiation fields through the weak values of system observables.</p>

Star-topology offers effective all-to-all connectivity in comparison to the square-grid topology and thus enables more hardware efficient implementation of some QEC codes. We encode two logical qubits in a star-topology superconducting QPU using the [[4,2,2]] code and characterize the logical states with the classical shadow framework. Logical life-time and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96 % for every cardinal logical state, find logical life-times above the best physical element, and logical error-per-cycle values ranging from from 0.25(2) % to 0.91(3) %.

            <h2>Efficient noise tailoring and detection of hypergraph states using Clifford circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guedong Park, Jinzhao Sun, Hyunseok Jeong</p>
            <p>Hypergraph states are important magic resources for realizing universal quantum computation and diverse non-local physical phenomena. However, noise detection for such states is challenging due to their large dimension and entanglement. This work proposes an efficient Clifford circuit-based scheme for tailoring and detecting noise in third-ordered hypergraph states generated by CCZ, CZ, and Z gates. The core part of our scheme is converting the noisy input state into a diagonal form and obtaining the convolution equation of noise rate via Clifford circuits. The depth of the Clifford circuit can be reduced to a constant, depending on the structure of the hypergraph state. After that, we decode it using the fast Hadamard-Walsh transform or some approximation method. The approximation with respect to the $l_2$-norm can be done efficiently by the number of qubits while keeping sufficient precision. Furthermore, the sparse noise assumption, which frequently holds in current experimental setups, enables $ l_1$ approximation. Compared with state verification methods, our method allows us to attain richer information on noise rates and apply various noise-adapted error correction and mitigation methods. Moreover, it bridges the connection between the convolution equation's nonlinearity and the Clifford hierarchy of the hypergraph state inputs. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the nature of highly entangled systems and drive the interests of the research venues concerning magic state implementation.</p>

            <p>$\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used in fields ranging from chemistry, material science to neuroscience. Nanoscale NMR spectroscopy using Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a promising platform due to an unprecedented sensitivity down to the single spin level. At the nanoscale, high nuclear spin polarization through spin fluctuations (statistical polarization) far outweighs thermal polarization. However, until now efficient NMR detection using coherent averaging techniques could not be applied to the detection of statistical polarization, leading to long measurement times. Here we present two protocols to enable coherent averaging of statistical oscillating signals through rectification. We demonstrate these protocols on an artificial radiofrequency signal detected with a single NV center at 2.7 T. Through this, the signal-to-noise scaling with number of measurements $N$ is improved from $N^{0.5}$ to $N^1$, improving the measurement time significantly. The relevance of rectification for the detection of statistical polarization using NV ensembles is outlined, paving the way for efficient nanoscale NMR spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ovidiu Cristinel Stoica</p>
            <p>Both empirical and theoretical objective science can only access relations, revealing nothing about the intrinsic nature of the entities "in relation". We typically refer to these entities as "matter", assuming their nature is irrelevant and that relational structures alone explain all phenomena, including consciousness. This would imply that consciousness arises not from matter itself but solely from its structural configurations. Consequently, if two worlds possess isomorphic structures and obey identical dynamical laws, isomorphic systems within these worlds should be equally sentient or insentient. I demonstrate that if this premise held true, the memories within an observer's brain would bear no correlation to the external world. Yet since we do acquire knowledge of the external world, structure alone must be insufficient: there exists something beyond relations, the intrinsic essence of the "stuff in relation". This essence imbues the observer's structure with sentience, metaphorically "breathing fire" into it. In turn, the observer confers physical meaning upon the world's structures. Remarkably, this conclusion emerges directly from physics and mathematics. Without acknowledging this intrinsic element, we would be incapable not only of subjective experience but also of acquiring any objective knowledge about the physical world.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jen-Tsung Hsiang, Bei-Lok Hu</p>
            <p>We continue our investigation of multi-partite open quantum systems comprising layers of structure using the atom-field-medium interactions as a familiarly important example. Same as in Paper I~\cite{HH24} we consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by the presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the graded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian nature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin equation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix elements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the $N$ system-atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is particularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a Gaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. As an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one system atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space, measured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one somewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The special feature refers to the non-monotonic behavior of the purity function when the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving the Robertson-Schrödinger function and displaying a similar qualitative behavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction scheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for the idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional treatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian open systems.</p>

            <p>Symmetry inherent in quantum states has been widely used to reduce the effect of noise in quantum error correction and a quantum error mitigation technique known as symmetry verification. However, these symmetry-based techniques exploit symmetry in quantum states rather than quantum channels, limiting their application to cases where the entire circuit shares the same symmetry. In this work, we propose symmetric channel verification (SCV), a channel purification protocol that leverages the symmetry inherent in quantum channels. By introducing different phases to each symmetric subspace and employing a quantum phase estimation-like circuit, SCV can detect and correct symmetry-breaking noise in quantum channels. We further propose a hardware-efficient implementation of SCV at the virtual level, which requires only a single-qubit ancilla and is robust against the noise in the ancilla qubit. Our protocol is applied to various Hamiltonian simulation circuits and phase estimation circuits, resulting in a significant reduction of errors. Furthermore, in setups where only Clifford unitaries can be used for noise purification, which is relevant in the early fault-tolerant regime, we show that SCV under Pauli symmetry represents the optimal purification method.</p>

            <p>Graph partitioning techniques enhance the efficiency of solving large-scale linear systems in the context of Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Even for systems of linear equations that are highly sparse, their direct solution via factorization methods, such as LU or Cholesky decomposition, is computationally expensive due to the introduction of non-zero elements, or ``fill-in.'' We introduce a quantum approach to the graph partitioning problem based on the variational quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm (VarQITE), allowing to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of reordering of sparse matrices to minimize the fill-in. We develop a hybrid quantum/classical pipeline to accelerate Finite Element solvers by integrating the VarQITE algorithm into the production workflow of Ansys' industrial software LS-DYNA. This allows to study multiple different types of FEA problems, ranging from mechanical engineering to computational fluid dynamics. We prove out that VarQITE positively impacts LS-DYNA workflows by measuring the wall-clock time to solution of FEA problems when compared against the classical heuristic graph partitioning solver in LS-DYNA. The selected instances cover a range of FEA problems, including simulation of blood pumps, roof crushing of cars, and vibration analysis of cars. We report performance results for our hybrid quantum-accelerated workflow on FEA meshes of up to 5.9M vertices and 55 million edges. We find that the wall clock time of the heuristics solutions used in the industry-grade solver is improved by up to 12\%. We also execute the VarQITE algorithm on quantum hardware (IonQ Aria and IonQ Forte) and find that the results are comparable to noiseless and noisy simulations. Finally, we introduce a hybrid technique for post-processing the found solutions with classical refinement heuristics such as Fiduccia-Mattheyses.</p>

            <p>Non-asymptotic quantum Shannon theory analyses how to transmit quantum information across a quantum channel as efficiently as possible within a specified error tolerance, given access to a finite, fixed, number of channel uses. In a recent work, we derived computable lower bounds on the non-asymptotic capacities of memoryless bosonic Gaussian channels. In this work, we extend these results to the non-Markovian bosonic Gaussian channel introduced in F. A. Mele, G. D. Palma, M. Fanizza, V. Giovannetti, and L. Lami IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 70(12), 8844-8869 (2024), which describes non-Markovian effects in optical fibres and is a non-Markovian generalisation of the pure loss channel. This allows us to determine how many uses of a non-Markovian optical fibre are sufficient in order to transmit $k$ qubits, distil $k$ ebits, or generate $k$ secret-key bits up to a given error tolerance $\varepsilon$. To perform our analysis, we prove novel properties of singular values of Toeplitz matrices, providing an error bound on the convergence rate of the celebrated Avram-Parter's theorem, which we regard as a new tool of independent interest for the field of quantum information theory and matrix analysis.</p>

            <p>We experimentally optimize the frequency of flux-tunable couplers in a superconducting quantum processor to minimize the impact of spectator transmons during quantum operations (single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates and readout) on other transmons. We adapt a popular transmon-like tunable-coupling element, achieving high-fidelity, low-leakage controlled-$Z$ gates with unipolar, fast-adiabatic pulsing only on the coupler. We demonstrate the ability of the tunable coupler to null residual $ZZ$ coupling as well as exchange couplings in the one- and two-excitation manifolds. However, the nulling of these coherent interactions is not simultaneous, prompting the exploration of tradeoffs. We present experiments pinpointing spectator effects on specific quantum operations. We also study the combined effect on the three types of operations using repeated quantum parity measurements.</p>

            <p>Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used: with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (3 {\mu}m gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lingnan Shen, Mao Lin, Cedric Yen-Yu Lin, Di Xiao, Ting Cao</p>
            <p>Strongly correlated topological phases of matter are central to modern condensed matter physics and quantum information technology but often challenging to probe and control in material systems. The experimental difficulty of accessing these phases has motivated the use of engineered quantum platforms for simulation and manipulation of exotic topological states. Among these, the Laughlin state stands as a cornerstone for topological matter, embodying fractionalization, anyonic excitations, and incompressibility. Although its bosonic analogs have been realized on programmable quantum simulators, a genuine fermionic Laughlin state has yet to be demonstrated on a quantum processor. Here, we realize the {\nu} = 1/3 fermionic Laughlin state on IonQ's Aria-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using an efficient and scalable Hamiltonian variational ansatz with 369 two-qubit gates on a 16-qubit circuit. Employing symmetry-verification error mitigation, we extract key observables that characterize the Laughlin state, including correlation hole and chiral edge modes, with strong agreement to exact diagonalization benchmarks. This work establishes a scalable quantum framework to simulate material-intrinsic topological orders and provides a starting point to explore its dynamics and excitations on digital quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Study of Magnetic Field Resilient High Impedance High-Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Camille Roy, Simone Frasca, Pasquale Scarlino</p>
            <p>Superconducting resonators with high-kinetic inductance play a central role in hybrid quantum circuits, enabling strong coupling with quantum systems with small electric dipole moment and improved parametric amplification. However, optimizing these resonators simultaneously for high internal quality factors ($Q_i$) and resilience to strong magnetic fields remains challenging. In this study, we systematically compare superconducting resonators fabricated from niobium nitride (NbN) and granular aluminum (grAl) thin films, each having similar kinetic inductance values ($L_k \sim 100$ pH/sq). At zero magnetic field, resonators made from grAl exhibit higher $Q_i$ compared to their NbN counterparts. However, under applied magnetic fields, NbN resonators demonstrate significantly better resilience. Moreover, NbN resonators exhibit an unexpected increase in $Q_i$ at intermediate in-plane magnetic fields ($B_{\parallel} \sim 1$ T), which we attribute to an enhanced frequency detuning that reduce coupling to two-level system defects. In contrast, grAl resonators show a distinct critical field above which $Q_i$ rapidly decreases, strongly depending on resonator cross-section respect to the applied field direction. Characterization of the nonlinear properties at zero magnetic field reveals that the self-Kerr coefficient in grAl resonators is more than an order of magnitude higher than in NbN resonators, making grAl particularly attractive for applications requiring pronounced nonlinear interactions. Our findings illustrate a clear trade-off between the two materials: NbN offers superior magnetic-field resilience beneficial for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics applications, while grAl is more advantageous in low-field regimes demanding high impedance and strong nonlinearity.</p>

            <p>Achieving and controlling non-reciprocity in engineered photonic structures is of fundamental interest in science and engineering. Here, we introduce a tunable, non-Hermitian, nonlinear microwave dimer designed to precisely implement phase-non-reciprocal hopping dynamics between two spatially separated cavities at room temperature. Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. L. Dao</p>
            <p>In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} can outperform the popular \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to \texttt{EfficientSU2} in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regimes of the bosonic model, both \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground states, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} circuits with small a number of parameters, attained a comparable albeit not as good performance as the much deeper \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahana Aziz, André H. A. Malavazi, Pedro R. Dieguez</p>
            <p>In this proceeding, we revisit the discussion presented in Ref. [Commun Phys 7, 373 (2024)], which examines the behavior of a quantum switch involving two arbitrary quantum operations when the control is exposed to environmental effects. Our study extends this analysis by focusing on the evolution of entanglement in the target system within the quantum switch framework, taking into account the influence of environmental conditions and control post-selection. We find that entanglement evolution is highly sensitive to these factors. While entanglement sudden death occurs under definite causal order, indefinite causal order can reverse this loss. We observe entanglement revival in high-temperature regimes and a sudden reappearance of entanglement under weak monitoring conditions at low temperatures. These findings provide insights into the resilience of the quantum switch in the presence of environmental disturbances and highlight its potential for applications where preserving entanglement is essential.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Péter E. Frenkel, Milán Mosonyi, Péter Vrana, Mihály Weiner</p>
            <p>The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szilágyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>We propose a superconducting quantum circuit whose low-energy degrees of freedom are described by the sine-Gordon (SG) quantum field theory. For suitably chosen parameters, the circuit hosts a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase protected by a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The ground state of the system is twofold degenerate and exhibits local spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry close to the edges of the circuit, leading to spontaneous localized edge supercurrents. The ground states host Majorana zero modes (MZM) at the edges of the circuit. On top of each of the two ground states, the system exhibits localized bound states at both edges, which are topologically protected against small disorder in the bulk. The spectrum of these boundary excitations should be observable in a circuit-QED experiment with feasible parameter choices.</p>

            <p>Direct dipole coupling between a two-level system and a bosonic mode describes the interactions present in a wide range of physical platforms. In this work, we study a coupling that is mixed between two pairs of quadratures of a bosonic mode and a spin. In this setting, we can suppress the dispersive shift while retaining a nonzero Kerr shift, which remarkably results in a cubic relationship between shot noise dephasing and thermal photons in the oscillator. We demonstrate this configuration with a simple toy model, quantify the expected improvements to photon shot-noise dephasing of the spin, and describe an approach to fast qubit readout via the Kerr shift. Further, we show how such a regime is achievable in superconducting circuits because magnetic and electric couplings can be of comparable strength, using two examples: the Cooper pair transistor and the fluxonium molecule.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aman Gupta, Daniel Prasanth, Venkat Chandra Gunja</p>
            <p>The future of quantum computing architecture is most likely the one in which a large number of clients are either fully classical or have a very limited quantum capability while a very small number of servers having the capability to perform quantum computations and most quantum computational tasks are delegated to these quantum servers. In this architecture, it becomes very crucial that a classical/semi-classical client is able to keep the delegated data/ computation secure against eavesdroppers as well as the server itself, known as the blindness feature. In 2009, A. Broadbent et. al proposed a universal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocol based on measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) that enables a semi-classical client to delegate universal quantum computation to a quantum server, interactively and fetch the results while the computation itself remains blind to the server. In this work, we propose an implementation (with examples) of UBQC in the current quantum computing architecture, a fully classical client, a quantum server (IBM Quantum) and the computation does not proceed interactively (projective measurement basis is not decided by previous measurement outcome). We combined UBQC with the 8-state remote state preparation (RSP) protocol, to blindly prepare the initial cluster state, which is an initial resource state in UBQC protocol, to allow a completely classical client to perform delegated blind quantum computation. Such an implementation has already been shown to be secure in a game-based security setting, which is the weakest security model.</p>

            <p>We show that Heisenberg exchange interactions between the neighboring spins comprising an ensemble spin qubit (E-qubit) can act as an intrinsic error mitigator, increasing gate fidelity even at high temperatures. As an example, the fidelity of a {\pi} gate applied to E-qubits above 1 K was studied by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange strength to show an exchange coupled E-qubit exhibits higher fidelity than a single-spin based qubit. We also investigate the coherence properties of E-qubits and find that the coherence time of an E-qubit extends linearly with the number of spins in the ensemble. This suggests that exchange interactions effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise, achieving a coherence time greater than 1 ms at 1 K with an ensemble of only seven spins. Additionally, the ferromagnetic isotropic exchange prevents fidelity loss induced by spatial field gradients/inhomogeneity in Zeeman and/or control fields. Therefore, exchange-coupled spin qubits could enable fault-tolerant quantum operations and long-coherence times at elevated temperatures (>1 K).</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</p>

            <p>A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</p>

            <p>Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.</p>

The spin of the conduction electrons generated in altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-momentum couplings, is quadratic in the current magnitude, varies as the second angular harmonic under variation of the current direction and does not require broken inversion symmetry. The effect is thus distinct from conventional current induced spin polarization phenomena which are linear in the current, vary as a first angular harmonic under variation of current direction and require broken inversion symmetry. The current-induced spin orientation in altermagnets is obtained using the kinetic theory for distribution functions in the spin-splitted subbands. It is shown that an application of external magnetic field significantly enhances the electron spin.</p>

            <p>The gatemon qubits, made of transparent super-semi Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such "gateless gatemon" qubits can be driven with Rabi frequencies more than 100 MHz, enabling gate operations much faster than what is possible with traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our gateless gatemons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent super-semi junctions bring to quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.</p>

            <h2>Efficient optimization and conceptual barriers in variational finite Projected Entangled-Pair States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Alcalde Puente, Erik Lennart Weerda, Konrad Schröder, Matteo Rizzi</p>
            <p>Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</p>

            <p>Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.</p>

            <h2>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $Ω$-spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yosuke Kubota</p>
            <p>We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p>Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</p>

Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$).

            <p>We explore the effects of gravitational waves (GWs) on hydrogen's radio spectral lines, focusing on the ground-state hyperfine transition and radiative transitions in highly excited Rydberg states. To analyze GW impacts on hyperfine structure, we derive Maxwell's equations in a gravitational-wave background using linearized gravity and the $3+1$ formalism. Our findings reveal that GWs induce energy shifts in hyperfine magnetic substates, modifying the 21 cm line. However, these energy shifts fall well below the detection limits of current radio astronomical instruments. For transitions in highly excited states, which produce radio recombination lines (RRL), the influence of GW manifests itself as spectral broadening, with the fractional linewidth for $\mathrm{H}n\alpha$ scaling as $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 \sim n^7\omega^2_{\mathrm{gw}}h(t)$. This suggests that RRLs could serve as probes for ultra-high-frequency GWs, particularly given that Rydberg atoms in the interstellar medium can reach quantum numbers above $n=100$. As an example of possibly detectable high frequency GW source, We investigate GWs emitted during the inspiral of planetary-mass primordial black hole binaries, where GW-induced broadening in RRLs could exceed natural broadening effects. Additionally, we examine the influence of the recently detected stochastic gravitational-wave background on hydrogen spectral lines.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

Our applications include (i) certifying whether auxiliary qubits can be safely disposed of, (ii) determining if a system is separable across a given bipartition, (iii) checking the transversality of a gate with respect to a given stabilizer code, and (iv) computing post-measurement states for computational basis measurements. Further, this logic is extended to accommodate universal quantum computing by deriving Hoare triples for the $T$-gate, multiply-controlled unitaries such as the Toffoli gate, and some gate injection circuits that use associated magic states. A number of interesting results emerge from this logic, including a lower bound on the number of $T$ gates necessary to perform a multiply-controlled $Z$ gate.</p>

            <p>A popular machine-learning model for regression tasks, including stock-market prediction, weather forecasting and real-estate pricing, is the classical support vector regression (SVR). However, a practically realisable quantum SVR remains to be formulated. We devise annealing-based algorithms, namely simulated and quantum-classical hybrid, for training two SVR models and compare their empirical performances against the SVR implementation of Python's scikit-learn package for facial-landmark detection (FLD), a particular use case for SVR. Our method is to derive a quadratic-unconstrained-binary formulation for the optimisation problem used for training a SVR model and solve this problem using annealing. Using D-Wave's hybrid solver, we construct a quantum-assisted SVR model, thereby demonstrating a slight advantage over classical models regarding FLD accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that annealing-based SVR models predict landmarks with lower variances compared to the SVR models trained by gradient-based methods. Our work is a proof-of-concept example for applying quantum-assisted SVR to a supervised-learning task with a small training dataset.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Wilson, Giulio Chiribella, Aleks Kissinger</p>
            <p>We provide a new characterisation of quantum supermaps in terms of an axiom that refers only to sequential and parallel composition. Consequently, we generalize quantum supermaps to arbitrary monoidal categories and operational probabilistic theories. We do so by providing a simple definition of locally-applicable transformation on a monoidal category. The definition can be rephrased in the language of category theory using the principle of naturality, and can be given an intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of which all proofs are presented. In our main technical contribution, we use this diagrammatic representation to show that locally-applicable transformations on quantum channels are in one-to-one correspondence with deterministic quantum supermaps. This alternative characterization of quantum supermaps is proven to work for more general multiple-input supermaps such as the quantum switch and on arbitrary normal convex spaces of quantum channels such as those defined by satisfaction of signaling constraints.</p>

            <p>The Bell theorem is explored in terms of a trade-off relation between underlying assumptions within the hidden variable model framework. In this paper, recognizing the incorporation of hidden variables as one of the fundamental assumptions, we propose a measure termed `hidden information' taking account of their distribution. This measure quantifies the number of hidden variables that essentially contribute to the empirical statistics. For factorizable models, hidden variable models that satisfy `locality' without adhering to the measurement independence criterion, we derive novel relaxed Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequalities. These inequalities elucidate trade-off relations between measurement dependence and hidden information in the CHSH scenario. It is also revealed that the relation gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the measures to be realized by a factorizable model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew L. Goh, Martin Larocca, Lukasz Cincio, M. Cerezo, Frédéric Sauvage</p>
            <p>The classical simulation of quantum dynamics plays an important role in our understanding of quantum complexity, and in the development of quantum technologies. Efficient techniques such as those based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem for Clifford circuits, tensor networks for low entanglement-generating circuits, or Wick's theorem for fermionic Gaussian states, have become central tools in quantum computing. In this work, we contribute to this body of knowledge by presenting a framework for classical simulations, dubbed "$\mathfrak{g}$-sim", which is based on the underlying Lie algebraic structure of the dynamical process. When the dimension of the algebra grows at most polynomially in the system size, there exists observables for which the simulation is efficient. Indeed, we show that $\mathfrak{g}$-sim enables new regimes for classical simulations, is able to deal with certain forms of noise in the evolution, as well as can be used to tackle several paradigmatic variational and non-variational quantum computing tasks. For the former, we perform Lie-algebraic simulations to train and optimize parametrized quantum circuits (thus effectively showing that some variational models can be dequantized), design enhanced parameter initialization strategies, solve tasks of quantum circuit synthesis, and train a quantum-phase classifier. For the latter, we report large-scale noiseless and noisy simulations on benchmark problems. By comparing the limitations of $\mathfrak{g}$-sim and certain Wick's theorem-based simulations, we find that the two methods become inefficient for different types of states or observables, hinting at the existence of distinct, non-equivalent, resources for classical simulation.</p>

            <h2>Solvable entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits with generalized space-time duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuan Liu, Wen Wei Ho</p>
            <p>We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$ dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of tri-unitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual-unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.</p>

            <p>We study the stroboscopic non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of periodically kicked Hamiltonians involving homogeneous central-spin interactions. The system exhibits a strong fragmentation of Hilbert space into four-dimensional Floquet-Krylov subspaces, which oscillate between two disjointed two-dimensional subspaces and thus break the discrete time-translation symmetry of the system. Our analytical and numerical analyses reveal that fully polarized states of the satellite spins exhibit fragmentations that are stable against perturbations and have high overlap with Floquet eigenstates of atypically low bipartite entanglement entropy (scar states). Motivated by the breaking of discrete time translation symmetry by Floquet-Krylov subspaces, we introduce a novel type of time crystal that we call a ``subspace time crystal''. We present evidence of robust time-crystalline behavior in the form of a period doubling of the total magnetization of fully polarized satellite spin states that persists over long time scales. We compute non-equilibrium phase diagrams with respect to a magnetic field, coupling terms, and pulse error for various interaction types, including Heisenberg, Ising, XXZ, and XX. We also discuss possible experimental realizations of scar time crystals in color center, quantum dot, and rare-earth ion platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Badhani, Sibasish Ghosh</p>
            <p>This work outlines a consistent method of identifying subsystems in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, independent of the underlying inner-product structure. Such Hilbert spaces arise in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric quantum mechanics, where a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is made self-adjoint by changing the inner product using the so-called ``metric operator". This is the framework of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. For composite quantum systems in this framework, defining subsystems is generally considered feasible only when the metric operator is chosen to have a tensor product form so that a partial trace operation can be well defined. In this work, we use arguments from algebraic quantum mechanics to show that the subsystems can be well-defined in every metric space - irrespective of whether or not the metric is of tensor product form. This is done by identifying subsystems with a decomposition of the underlying C*-algebra into commuting subalgebras. Although the choice of the metric is known to have no effect on the system's statistics, we show that different choices of the metric can lead to inequivalent subsystem decompositions. Each of the subsystems can be tomographically constructed and these subsystems satisfy the no-signalling principle. With these results, we put all the choices of the metric operator on an equal footing for composite systems.</p>

We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</p>

The condition is also shown to imply exponential decay of the state's mutual information between disjoint regions, and hence exponential clustering of local observables. The applicability of the general results is demonstrated on the quantum Ising model in transverse field. Combined with available model-specific information on spin-spin correlations, we establish an area-law type bound on the entanglement in the model's subcritical ground states, valid in all dimensions and up to the model's quantum phase transition.</p>

We demonstrate, however, that a weak pointer is at the same time an inaccurate one, and the information about the path taken by the system in each individual trial is inevitably lost. We show also that a similar problem occurs if a classical system is monitored by an inaccurate quantum meter. In both cases one can still determine some characteristic of the corresponding statistical ensemble, a relation between path probabilities in the classical case, and a relation between the probability amplitudes if a quantum system is involved.</p>

            <p>Simulation of physical systems is one of the most promising use cases of future digital quantum computers. In this work we systematically analyze the quantum circuit complexities of block encoding the discretized elliptic operators that arise extensively in numerical simulations for partial differential equations, including high-dimensional instances for many-body simulations. When restricted to rectangular domains with separable boundary conditions, we provide explicit circuits to block encode the many-body Laplacian with separable periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions, using standard discretization techniques from low-order finite difference methods. To obtain high-precision, we introduce a scheme based on periodic extensions to solve Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems using a high-order finite difference method, with only a constant increase in total circuit depth and subnormalization factor. We then present a scheme to implement block encodings of differential operators acting on more arbitrary domains, inspired by Cartesian immersed boundary methods. We then block encode the many-body convective operator, which describes interacting particles experiencing a force generated by a pair-wise potential given as an inverse power law of the interparticle distance. This work provides concrete recipes that are readily translated into quantum circuits, with depth logarithmic in the total Hilbert space dimension, that block encode operators arising broadly in applications involving the quantum simulation of quantum and classical many-body mechanics.</p>

We employ this formalism to rigorously derive radiative pumping and vibrational relaxation rates. We show that radiative pumping is the emission from incoherent excitons and divide its rate into transmitted and re-absorbed components. On the other hand, the vibrational relaxation rate in the weak linear vibronic coupling regime is composed of a $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ contribution already accounted for by radiative pumping, and a $\mathcal{O}(1/N^2)$ contribution from a second-order process in the \textit{single}-molecule light-matter coupling that we call polariton-assisted Raman scattering. This scattering is enhanced when the difference between fluorescence and lower polariton frequencies matches a Raman-active excitation.</p>

Specifically, under Markovian processes, ergotropy, a measure of the extractable work from a system under unitary evolution monotonically decreases. However, in non-Markovian dynamics, ergotropy fluctuates, leading to a backflow effect that highlights memory-induced resource recovery. Our findings suggest that this ergotropy backflow could serve as an operationally meaningful indicator of non-Markovianity, offering new perspectives on the interplay between memory effects and thermodynamic behavior in open quantum systems. This study enhances the theoretical framework for understanding energy dynamics under ergodic channels and highlights new avenues for exploring the implications of memory effects in quantum batteries.</p>

            <h2>The x+y Floquet code: A simple example for topological quantum computation in the path integral approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Bauer</p>
            <p>The path-integral approach to topological quantum error correction provides a unified way to construct and analyze fault-tolerant circuits in spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate its utility and versatility at hand of a simple example: We construct a new fault-tolerant circuit for the toric-code phase by traversing its path integral on a $(x,y,z)$ cubic lattice in the $x+y$ direction. The circuit acts on qubits on a square lattice, and alternates between horizontal nearest-neighbor $CX$ gates and vertical nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ and $XX$ measurements. We show how to incorporate boundaries and corners into the fault-tolerant circuit and how to perform topologically protected logic gates. As a specific example, we consider performing a fault-tolerant logical $ZZ$ measurement via lattice surgery of two spatial rectangular blocks of our fault-tolerant circuit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trinidad B. Lantaño, Luciano Petruzziello, Susana F. Huelga, Martin B. Plenio</p>
            <p>Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction in the Newtonian limit. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering the general relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</p>

            <h2>Analog Quantum Simulation of Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics in Molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jong-Kwon Ha, Ryan J. MacDonell</p>
            <p>Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for quantum dynamics simulations. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. We present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinchi Huang, Hirofumi Nishi, Taichi Kosugi, Yoshifumi Kawada, Yu-ichiro Matsushita</p>
            <p>Simulating differential equations on classical computers becomes an intractable problem if the grid size is extremely large. Quantum computers are believed to achieve a possibly exponential speedup in the matrix operation. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving the advection-diffusion-reaction equation by employing a novel approximate probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) operator. First, the effectiveness of the proposed approximate PITE operator is justified by the theoretical evaluation of the error. Next, we construct the explicit quantum circuit to realize the imaginary-time evolution of the Hamiltonian coming from the advection-diffusion equation, whose gate complexity is logarithmic regarding the size of the discretized Hamiltonian matrix. Compared to the existing algorithms for the quantum linear system problem, our algorithm achieves an exponential speedup regarding the matrix size at the cost of a worse dependence on the error bound. Moreover, numerical simulations using gate-based quantum emulator for 1D/2D examples are also provided to verify our algorithm. Finally, we extend our algorithm to the coupled system of advection-diffusion equations to show the prospects for practical applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Mehta, Anne Müller</p>
            <p>In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, a user that holds a ciphertext and a function key can learn the result of applying the function to the plaintext message. Security requires that the user does not learn anything beyond the function evaluation. We extend this notion to the quantum setting by providing definitions and a construction for a quantum functional encryption (QFE) scheme which allows for the evaluation of polynomialy-sized circuits on arbitrary quantum messages. Our construction is built upon quantum garbled circuits [BY22]. We also investigate the relationship of QFE to the seemingly unrelated notion of unclonable encryption (UE) and find that any QFE scheme universally achieves the property of unclonable functional encryption (UFE). In particular we assume the existence of an unclonable encryption scheme with quantum decryption keys which was recently constructed by [AKY24]. Our UFE guarantees that two parties cannot simultaneously recover the correct function outputs using two independently sampled function secret keys. As an application we give the first construction for public-key UE with variable decryption keys. Lastly, we establish a connection between quantum indistinguishability obfuscation (qiO) and quantum functional encryption (QFE); Showing that any multi-input indistinguishability-secure quantum functional encryption scheme unconditionally implies the existence of qiO.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhang Loran, Ali Mostafazadeh</p>
            <p>The transfer matrix of scattering theory in one dimension can be expressed in terms of the time-evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. In particular, it admits a Dyson series expansion which turns out to facilitate the construction of the low-frequency series expansion of the scattering data. In two and three dimensions, there is a similar formulation of stationary scattering where the scattering properties of the scatterer are extracted from the evolution operator for a corresponding effective quantum system. We explore the utility of this approach to scattering theory in the study of the scattering of low-frequency time-harmonic scalar waves, $e^{-i\omega t}\psi(\mathbf{r})$, with $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfying the Helmholtz equation, $[\nabla^2+k^2\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)]\psi(\mathbf{r})=0$, $\omega$ and $k$ being respectively the angular frequency and wavenumber of the incident wave, and $\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)$ denoting the relative permittivity of the carrier medium which in general takes complex values. We obtain explicit formulas for low-frequency scattering amplitude, examine their effectiveness in the study of a class of exactly solvable scattering problems, and outline their application in devising a low-frequency cloaking scheme.</p>

            <p>Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum technologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of such light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this direction. Specifically, it has been shown how the use of fully quantized approaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high harmonic generation, can lead to the generation of high photon-number non-classical and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the fundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and discuss the recent developments and future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong light fields with the potential application in ultrafast and quantum information science. These findings represent an important step in the development of novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy methods, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light and those of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Permutation puzzles, such as the Rubik's Cube and the 15 puzzle, are enjoyed by the general public and mathematicians alike. Here we introduce quantum versions of permutation puzzles where the pieces of the puzzles are replaced with indistinguishable quantum particles. The moves in the puzzle are achieved by swapping or permuting the particles. We show that simply permuting the particles can be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle, even though the identical particles are entangled. However, we obtain a genuine quantum puzzle by adding a quantum move: the square root of SWAP. The resulting puzzle cannot be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle. We focus predominately on the quantization of the $2\times 2$ slide puzzle and briefly treat the $2\times 2 \times 1$ Rubik's Cube.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate three schemes for implementing Controlled-Z (CZ) gates between individual ytterbium (Yb) rare-earth ions doped into yttrium orthovanadate (YVO$_4$ or YVO). Specifically, we investigate the CZ gates based on magnetic dipolar interactions between Yb ions, photon scattering off a cavity, and a photon interference-based protocol, with and without an optical cavity. We introduce a theoretical framework for precise computations of state and gate infidelities, accounting for noise effects. We then compute the state fidelity for each scheme to evaluate the feasibility of their experimental implementation. Based on these results, we compare the performance of the two-qubit gate schemes and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. We conclude that the probabilistic photon interference-based scheme offers the best fidelity scaling with cooperativity and is superior with the current technology of Yb values, while photon scattering is nearly deterministic but slower with less favourable fidelity scaling as a function of cooperativity. The cavityless magnetic dipolar scheme provides a fast, deterministic gate with decent fidelities if close ion localization can be realized. While focusing on $^{171}\text{Yb}^{3+}: \text{YVO}$ system as a case study, the theoretical tools and approaches developed in this work are broadly applicable to other spin qubit systems.</p>

This work introduces and proves, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the Petz in terms of entanglement fidelity. In some special cases, the violation of this condition can be easily characterized by a simple commutator that can be efficiently computed.

            <p>With the demonstrated ability to perform calculations in seconds that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years, quantum computers namely hold the promise of radically advancing sustainable IT. However, quantum computers face challenges due to the inherent noise in physical qubits, necessitating error correction for reliable operation in solving industrial-scale problems, which will require more computation time, energy, and electronic components than initial laboratory-scale experiments. Yet, while researchers have modeled and analyzed the environmental impacts of classical computers using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the environmental performance of quantum computing remains unknown to date. This study contributes to filling this critical gap in two ways: (1) by establishing an environmental profile for quantum computers based on superconducting qubits; and (2) by comparing it to a functionally equivalent profile of a state-of-the-art supercomputer. With the comparison based on the problem size, the paper shows how the usage time can drive an environmental advantage for quantum computers under specific scaling conditions and quantum error correcting codes. The results emphasize that quantum error correction hardware has a substantial environmental impact due to the numerous electronic components needed to achieve 100 logical qubits. This paper can serve as a basis for designing more environmentally friendly quantum computers and for establishing their environmental profiles, as well as those of the human activities that will use them.</p>

            <p>Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schrödinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.</p>

            <p>Impurity-bound excitons in II-VI direct-bandgap semiconductors are promising optically active solid-state spin qubits that combine exceptional optical quantum efficiency with an ultra-low spin noise environment. Previous studies on single impurities relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving of quantum emitters to precisely control optical transitions and maintain coherence of the emission. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission of quantum light from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. The resonantly driven emitter exhibits bright quantum light emission that preserves the phase of the resonant drive, validated through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation enables us to directly measure the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, which indicates high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically-driven ionization process that we attribute to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We show that incoherent, low-power laser pumping efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns, recovering the resonance fluorescence emission from the bound exciton. These results pave the way for coherent optical and spin control of the single impurity states through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Understanding the Page curve and resolving the black hole information puzzle in terms of the entanglement dynamics of black holes has been a key question in fundamental physics. In principle, the current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Our findings indicate that while both entanglement entropy measurement protocols accurately estimate the Rényi entropy in numerical simulation, the randomized measurement protocol has a particular advantage over the swap-based many-body interference protocol in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques, we establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entanglement entropy of complex quantum systems and can probe black hole dynamics within simplified toy qubit models.</p>

            <p>With the growth of quantum platforms for gate-based quantum computation, compilation holds a crucial factor in deciding the success of the implementation. There has been rich research and development in compilation techniques for the superconducting-qubit regime. In contrast, the trapped-ion architectures, currently leading in robust quantum computations due to their reliable operations, do not have many competitive compilation strategies. This work presents a novel unifying abstraction, called the position graph, for different types of hardware architectures. Using this abstraction, we model trapped-ion Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures and enable high-quality, scalable superconducting compilation methods. In particular, we devise a scheduling algorithm called SHuttling-Aware PERmutative heuristic search algorithm (SHAPER) to tackle the complex constraints and dynamics of trapped-ion QCCD with the cooperation of state-of-the-art permutation-aware mapping. This approach generates native, executable circuits and ion instructions on the hardware that adheres to the physical constraints of shuttling-based quantum computers. Using the position graph abstraction, we evaluate our algorithm on theorized and actual architectures. Our algorithm can successfully compile programs for these architectures where other state-of-the-art algorithms fail. In the cases when other algorithms complete, our algorithm produces a schedule that is $14\%$ faster on average, up to $69\%$ in the best case.\\ {\bf Reproducibility:} source code and computational results are available at $[$will be added upon acceptance$]$</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose and analyze optimization strategies for the VQE algorithm that combine various methods, including molecular point group symmetries (symmetry adaptation), compact excitation circuits (qubit-excitation-based), different types of excitation sets, and qubit tapering. These strategies allow for a significant reduction in computational requirements while ensuring convergence to the correct energies. First, we apply these combinations to small molecules, such as LiH and BeH2, to evaluate their compatibility, accuracy, and potential applicability to larger problems. We then simulate the methylamine molecule within its restricted active space using the best-performing optimization strategies. Finally, we complete our analysis by estimating the resources required for full active-space simulations of the methylamine and formic acid molecules. Our best-performing optimization strategy reduces the number of two-qubit operations for simulating the methylamine molecule from 600,000 (in the STO-3G basis with a naive Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz) to approximately 12,000, using 26 qubits. Thus, the proposed combination of optimization methods can reduce the number of two-qubit operations by nearly two orders of magnitude. Although, we present alternative approaches that are of interest in the context of the further optimization in the number of two-qubit operation, we note that these approaches do not perform well enough in terms of the convergence to required energies. While these challenges persist, our resource analysis represents a valuable step towards the practical use of quantum computers and the development of better methods for optimizing computing resources.</p>

            <p>Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</p>

            <h2>Critical dynamics and its interferometry in the one-dimensional p-wave-paired Aubry-André-Harper model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Han Zhang, Han-Chuan Kou, Peng Li</p>
            <p>In this work, we focus on the critical dynamics of the one-dimensional quasiperiodic p-wave-paired Aubry-André-Harper model, which exhibits a transition point between the gapped critical and the gapless localized phases. First, we disclose that the dynamical exponent features two distinct plateaus in the gapless localized phase. Besides the plateau with dynamical exponent $z=1.388$ near the transition point, there is a second one with $z=1$ away from the transition point. Then we demonstrate that these two plateaus intrinsically affect the critical dynamics with moderate quench rate by employing both one-way and round-trip quench protocols. In the one-way quench protocol, we clarify that the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) regime consists of two sub-regimes with different KZ exponents, which is a direct consequence of the two-plateau structure of the dynamical exponent. We also diagnose the KZ, pre-saturated, and saturated regimes by varying the quench rate from slow to fast limits. While, in the round-trip quench protocol, we confirm the interference effect of two critical dynamics and show a narrow neck in the oscillatory density of defects. It turns out that the position of the neck depends on the ratio of to-and-fro quench rates and the p-wave superconductivity pairing amplitude. We show how the position of the neck can be used to quantitatively determine the turning point of the two KZ sub-regimes.</p>

            <p>A novel hybrid quantum-classical approach has been developed to efficiently address the multireference quantum chemistry problem. The Handover Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HiVQE) is designed to accurately estimate ground-state wavefunctions by leveraging both quantum and classical computing resources. In this framework, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardwares efficiently explore electron configurations, while classical computers compute the corresponding wavefunction without the effect of noise of NISQ computer, ensuring both accuracy and computational efficiency. By generating compact yet chemically accurate wavefunctions, HiVQE advances quantum chemistry simulations and facilitates the discovery of novel materials. This approach demonstrates significant potential for overcoming the limitations of classical methods in strongly correlated electronic systems.</p>

            <h2>The Art of Avoiding Constraints: A Penalty-free Approach to Constrained Combinatorial Optimization with QAOA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prashanti Priya Angara, Danylo Lykov, Ulrike Stege, Yuri Alexeev, Hausi Müller</p>
            <p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed to determine optimum and near optimum solutions of quadratic (and higher order) unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO or HUBO) problems, which in turn accurately model unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems. While the solution space of an unconstrained combinatorial optimization problem consists of all possible combinations of the objective function's decision variables, for a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the solution space consists only of solutions that satisfy the problem constraints. While solving such a QUBO problem optimally results in an optimal solution to the underlying constrained problem, setting the right penalty parameters is crucial. Moreover, finding suitable penalties that ensure near-optimal solutions is also challenging. In this article, we introduce our innovative profit-relaxation framework to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. Our effective hybrid approach transforms a selected constrained combinatorial optimization problem into an unconstrained profit problem, such that the solution spaces of the two problems are interrelated with respect to their solution qualities. This allows us to determine optimal and near-optimal solutions for the constrained problem. We use three NP-hard problems -- Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Independent Set, and Maximum Clique -- to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation of our profit-relaxation framework on two different platforms: Xanadu PennyLane and Argonne QTensor Quantum Circuit Simulator.</p>

            <h2>Sagnac interferometer-based noise-free superresolution using phase-controlled quantum erasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byoung S. Ham</p>
            <p>Interferometer-based precision measurements have been intensively studied for sensing and metrology over the past half century. In classical optics, the resolution and phase sensitivity of an optical signal are confined by diffraction limit and shot-noise limit (SNL), respectively. Highly entangled photon pairs, i.e., N00N states have been adapted to overcome SNL in quantum sensing over the last two decades. Recently, coherent light-excited quantum sensing has also been proposed and demonstrated for macroscopic quantum sensing to overcome the limited N scalability in N00N-based quantum sensing. Here, a Sagnac interferometer-based superresolution is proposed to solve environmental noises inevitable in an interferometer. Furthermore, a spatial light modulator takes over the role of phase-controlled quantum erasers to solve the linear optics-based complexity issue in the coherently-excited superresolution. Thus, the proposed Sagnac superresolution can beat the state-of-the-art ring laser gyroscope applied for inertial navigation and geodesy.</p>

            <p>Modeling composite systems of spins or electrons coupled to bosonic modes is of significant interest for many fields of applied quantum physics and chemistry. A quantum simulation can allow for the solution of quantum problems beyond classical numerical methods. However, implementing this on existing noisy quantum computers can be challenging due to the mapping between qubits and bosonic degrees of freedom, often requiring a large number of qubits or deep quantum circuits. In this work, we discuss quantum algorithms to solve composite systems by augmenting conventional superconducting qubits with microwave resonators used as computational elements. This enables direct representation of bosonic modes by resonators. We derive efficient algorithms for typical models and propose a device connectivity that allows for feasible scaling of simulations with linear overhead. We also show how the dissipation of resonators can be a useful parameter for modeling continuous bosonic baths. Experimental results demonstrating these methods were obtained on the IQM Resonance cloud platform, based on high-fidelity gates and tunable couplers. These results present the first digital quantum simulation including a computational resonator on a commercial quantum platform.</p>

            <h2>A non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics with local modulus symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Zhou</p>
            <p>We have constructed a non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics based on local modulus symmetry. The resulting connection in the covariant derivative is identified as the escape velocity of the gravitational field. A new real and positive function called the quantum metric function is attached to the complex conjugate of the wave function to satisfy the local modulus symmetry requirement. In an expanding universe, these theoretical features produce new effects that deviate from predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. The quantum metric function yields negligible change for microscopic objects but produces quantum pointer states for macroscopic objects, thus providing a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The time-reversal symmetry is broken in the new quantum kinematics, which has implications for the second law of thermodynamics. The modification of Newtonian gravity is negligible in smaller bound systems but can become significant at the galactic scales. Its potential association with the mass discrepancy problem in the galactic systems is discussed.</p>

Both in Floquet systems and in the related problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then classify noninteracting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy equivalence.</p>

            <p>Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. These are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories, but we argue that they offer a simpler and more practical approach. Our main examples of involutive Markov categories have pre-C*-algebras, including infinite-dimensional ones, as objects, together with completely positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. In this context, we prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.</p>

            <p>Micro-Ring Resonators (MRRs) allow us to access the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect at a variety of tunable parameter combinations along exact analytic solutions. This higher-dimensional space of parameters for which the HOM effect occurs constitutes what is known as a Hong-Ou-Mandel manifold (HOMM). Using a parallel series of non-identical MRRs and changing relative round-trip phase shifts between MRRs allows for the manipulation of the wavelength locations of the HOM effect. Through clever design and fabrication, we can mold the HOMM to place multiple HOM effects, or lack thereof, precisely at desired locations in wavelength. In this paper we discuss how to adjust non-identical MRR parameters to change the resulting HOMM. We also promote example designs that exhibit advantageous HOMM structures, and highlight some of the diverse possibilities that can be accessed with different circuit design. Our main examples are: 1) a wavelength division multiplexer example that matches the HOM effect locations with the already established channels to integrate with a classical communication network and 2) a HOM-based entanglement switch that allows for the rapid switching between 2-photon NOON state outputs and completely separable single photon outputs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Yuki Haruna, Yusuke Nishida, Yoshiro Takahashi</p>
            <p>A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</p>

We aim to challenge the concept of a single "quantum divide" by offering a comprehensive view. We propose four divides: in science, technologies, between countries, and within societies. The "Quantum Divide in Science" highlights gaps among scientists and access inequalities in research communities. The second divide, "Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency," looks at technology adoption processes. The "Quantum Divide between Countries" examines adoption reasons and outcomes across countries with varying development levels. Lastly, the "Quantum Divide within Societies" addresses societal implications, one of the most discussed in literature. We propose directions to navigate these divides, noting their interconnectedness and impact on innovation ecosystems. This study guides those interested in the quantum divide, navigation strategies, and QT's influence on scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.</p>

            <h2>Global anomalies of Green's function zeros</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su, Ivar Martin</p>
            <p>Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories that supposedly describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy. We view the nonlocal effective theories including the simplest Lagrangian and its two-pole variant associated with a gapless Dirac zero as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomaly, we discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on possible phases, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</p>

            <p>Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</p>

            <p>Deep sub-diffraction exoplanet discovery currently lies beyond the reach of state-of-the-art direct imaging coronagraphs, which typically have an inner working angle larger than the diffraction scale. We present an experimental demonstration of a direct imaging coronagraph design capable of achieving the quantum limits of exoplanet detection and localization below the Rayleigh diffraction limit. Our benchtop implementation performs a forward and inverse pass through a free-space programmable spatial mode sorter configured to isolate photons in a point spread function (PSF)-adapted mode basis. During the forward pass, the fundamental mode is rejected, effectively eliminating light from an on-axis point-like star. On the inverse pass, the remaining modes are coherently recombined to form an image of a faint companion. Our experimental system is shown localizing an artificial exoplanet at sub-diffraction distances from its host star under a 1000:1 star-planet contrast.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Carlos Pelayo, George Bougas, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Simeon I. Mistakidis</p>
            <p>We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the crossover region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</p>

Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -> 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -> 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehua Tian, Xiaobao Liu, Jieci Wang, Jiliang Jing</p>
            <p>We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex May, Sabrina Pasterski, Chris Waddell, Michelle Xu</p>
            <p>In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we use cryptographic tools related to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Bao, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Zhihan Liu</p>
            <p>By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</p>

            <p>We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d > 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is more precisely a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known solutions, particularly the extensive work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of nonequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by maximal equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If K is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of K, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sepide Mohamadi, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.</p>

            <h2>$\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</p>

            <h2>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Sinha, Trideb Shit, Avinash Tetarwal, Diptiman Sen, Sebabrata Mukherjee</p>
            <p>The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic intra-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</p>

            <p>We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation within a specified class. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. We illustrate our presentation with three- and four-dimensional spin chains of difference form with local interactions. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.</p>

            <h2>Quantum geometry and adiabaticity in molecules and in condensed matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele Resta</p>
            <p>The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.</p>

            <p>In superconducting quantum devices, Purcell filters protect qubit information from decaying into external lines by reducing external coupling at qubit frequencies while maintaining it at readout frequencies. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a novel Purcell filter design that places the readout resonator frequencies in a "linewidth plateau" below the filter's first resonant mode. This approach, based on direct admittance engineering, can simultaneously achieve strong qubit protection and nearly constant external coupling across a wide readout bandwidth, addressing the traditional tradeoff between these properties. We first present a lumped-element analysis of our filters. We then experimentally demonstrate a compact on-chip linewidth-plateau filter, coupled to four resonators across its approximately 1 GHz readout band. We compare the measured linewidths to numerical predictions, and show how the filter protects a frequency-tunable transmon qubit from external decay. We envision that our flexible design paradigm will aid in efforts to create multiplexed readout architectures for superconducting quantum circuits, with well-controlled external couplings.</p>

            <p>A promising quantum computing architecture comprises modules of superconducting quantum processors linked by optical channels via quantum transducers. To map transducer device performance to system-level channel performance, our model uses Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate 2-to-1 and 3-to-1 entanglement distillation protocols. We show that the Extreme Photon Loss distillation protocol is particularly high performing and that, even without distillation, present-day transducers are at the threshold of enabling Bell pair distribution with fidelities of 50%. If the next generation of transducers can improve by 3 orders of magnitude in both added noise and efficiency, and increase repetition rates by 50x, then they would allow for remote two-qubit gates achieving 99.7% fidelities at 100 kHz rates. These results set targets for transducers to be ready for deployment into scaled superconducting quantum computers.</p>

            <p>In this work we introduce a superconducting quantum processor architecture that uses a transmission-line resonator to implement effective all-to-all connectivity between six transmon qubits. This architecture can be used as a test-bed for algorithms that benefit from high connectivity. We show that the central resonator can be used as a computational element, which offers the flexibility to encode a qubit for quantum computation or to utilize its bosonic modes which further enables quantum simulation of bosonic systems. To operate the quantum processing unit (QPU), we develop and benchmark the qubit-resonator conditional Z gate and the qubit-resonator MOVE operation. The latter allows for transferring a quantum state between one of the peripheral qubits and the computational resonator. We benchmark the QPU performance and achieve a genuinely multi-qubit entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state over all six qubits with a readout-error mitigated fidelity of $0.86$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Asaoka, Yasunari Suzuki, Yuuki Tokunaga</p>
            <p>Exploring an efficient and scalable architecture of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is vital for demonstrating useful quantum computing. Here, we propose and evaluate a scalable and practical architecture with a cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED) network. Our architecture takes advantage of the stability of neutral atoms and the flexibility of a CQED network. We show a concrete framework for implementing surface codes and numerically analyze the logical error rate and threshold values beyond the simplified circuit-level noise model on several network structures. Although the requirement of CQED parameters is demanding given the current performance of experimental systems, we show that an error-decoding algorithm tailored to our proposed architecture, where the loss information of ancillary photons is utilized, greatly improves the error threshold. For example, the internal cooperativity, a good figure of merit of the cavity performance for quantum computing, required for FTQC is relaxed to 1/5 compared to the normal error-decoding for the surface code. Since our proposal and results can be extended to other LDPC codes straightforwardly, our approach will lead to achieve more reliable FTQC using CQED.</p>

            <p>We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of spin models.</p>

            <p>Pre-fault tolerant quantum computers have already demonstrated the ability to estimate observable values accurately, at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. This has been enabled by error mitigation techniques that often rely on a representative model on the device noise. However, learning and maintaining these models is complicated by fluctuations in the noise over unpredictable time scales, for instance, arising from resonant interactions between superconducting qubits and defect two-level systems (TLS). Such interactions affect the stability and uniformity of device performance as a whole, but also affect the noise model accuracy, leading to incorrect observable estimation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that tuning of the qubit-TLS interactions helps reduce noise instabilities and consequently enables more reliable error-mitigation performance. These experiments provide a controlled platform for studying the performance of error mitigation in the presence of quasi-static noise. We anticipate that the capabilities introduced here will be crucial for the exploration of quantum applications on solid-state processors at non-trivial scales.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting correlations from BTZ black hole coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaofang Liu, Wentao Liu, Zhilong Liu, Jieci Wang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.</p>

            <h2>On the generalized eigenvalue problem in subspace-based excited state methods for quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prince Frederick Kwao, Srivathsan Poyyapakkam Sundar, Brajesh Gupt, Ayush Asthana</p>
            <p>Solving challenging problems in quantum chemistry is one of the leading promised applications of quantum computers. Within the quantum algorithms proposed for problems in excited state quantum chemistry, subspace-based quantum algorithms, including quantum subspace expansion (QSE), quantum equation of motion (qEOM) and quantum self-consistent equation-of-motion (q-sc-EOM), are promising for pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices. The working equation of QSE and qEOM requires solving a generalized eigenvalue equation with associated matrix elements measured on a quantum computer. Our quantitative analysis of the QSE method shows that the errors in eigenvalues increase drastically with an increase in the condition number of the overlap matrix when a generalized eigenvalue equation is solved in the presence of statistical sampling errors. This makes such methods unstable to errors that are unavoidable when using quantum computers. Further, at very high condition numbers of overlap matrix, the QSE's working equation could not be solved without any additional steps in the presence of sampling errors as it becomes ill-conditioned. It was possible to use the thresholding technique in this case to solve the equation, but the solutions achieved had missing excited states, which may be a problem for future chemical studies. We also show that excited-state methods that have an eigenvalue equation as the working equation, such as q-sc-EOM, do not have such problems and could be suitable candidates for excited-state quantum chemistry calculations using quantum computers.</p>

            <p>The term "light dragging" describes how the trajectory of light changes as it travels through a moving medium. This phenomenon facilitates the precise detection of incredibly slow speeds of light, which is widely used in quantum gate operations, state transfer, and quantum memory implementations, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have proposed the existence of a light-dragging effect in a magnomechanical system (MMS). The origin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive interactions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index profile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong dependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within the magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by adjusting the probe's detuning. The ability to control and manipulate the light drag through the MMS could be helpful in designing novel devices with improved functionality at the microscopic scale.</p>

The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes.

            <p>The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</p>

Thermal noise can arise from two sources: the first being when the oscillator starts in a thermal state, and the second when a continuous thermal bath is in contact with the oscillator. We find that for the appropriate oscillator quality factor $Q$, violation always exists for any value of magnetic coupling $\lambda$ and thermal occupancy $\bar n$. Cooling the oscillator to its ground state provides an $O(\bar n)$ improvement in the EW violation than starting in a thermal state. However, this still requires at least 10$^{5}$ measurements to be determined. We then consider how to use magnetic interactions to realize this idea.</p>

            <h2>Quantum switches for single-photon routing and entanglement generation in waveguide-based networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Cumbrado, Ricardo Puebla</p>
            <p>The interconnection of quantum nodes holds great promise for scaling up quantum computing units and enabling information processing across long-distance quantum registers. Such quantum networks can be realized using superconducting qubits linked by waveguides, which facilitate fast and robust on-demand quantum information exchange via traveling single photons. In this article, we propose leveraging additional qubit degrees of freedom as quantum switches that coherently condition the system dynamics. These switches are implemented using a qubit dispersively coupled to transfer resonators, which mediate interactions between node qubits and quantum links. Through wavepacket shaping techniques, we demonstrate that when the switch is closed, full excitation transfer occurs as a propagating photon, whereas an open switch allows only partial transfer without distorting the shape of the emitted photon. Based on this switch mechanism, we present deterministic protocols for generating entangled states via single-photon routing across the network, such as Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states. The feasibility of our approach is validated through numerical simulations of a three-node network, incorporating decoherence and photon loss effects. Our results indicate that high-fidelity entangled states can be realized employing the proposed quantum switches in current state-of-the-art platforms.</p>

We provide a few different approaches to derive the analytical solution valid for any time during the evolution and for any number of spins. These approaches range from solving a set of coupled rate equations, to observing exceptional points stemming from non-Hermitian evolution, to the use of combinatorics and probabilistic methods, and finally to utilizing techniques based on the quantum jump unraveling of the master equation. The solution is expressed as a residue sum stemming from a contour integral in the complex plane and suggests the possibility of fully analytical solutions for a wider range of quantum open system dynamics problems.</p>

Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinfull model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</p>

We assume that each giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via two coupling points and hence there exist four and sixteen coupling configurations for the single-giant-atom case and two-giant-atom separate coupling case, respectively. By solving the single-photon scattering problem in the real space, we obtain the exact expressions of the single-photon scattering amplitudes. It is found that a single photon in the SSH waveguide can be completely reflected or transmitted by choosing proper coupling configurations, coupling-point distances, atomic resonance frequency, and dimerization parameter. In addition, under proper parameter conditions, the scattering spectra are periodically modulated by the coupling-point distances. We also find that the collective behavior of the two giant atoms can be adjusted by quantum interference effect and topological effect and that the single-photon scattering spectra can exhibit the Lorentzian, super-Gaussian, electromagnetically induced transparencylike, and asymmetric Fano line shapes for some coupling configurations. This work will inspire the development of controllable single-photon devices based on the giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Averaging for High-Fidelity Quantum Logic Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell</p>
            <p>We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling Mølmer-Sørensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Quantum systems of atoms with highly singular interaction potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.I. Yukalov, E.P. Yukalova</p>
            <p>Quantum statistical systems, composed of atoms or molecules interacting with each other through highly singular non-integrable potentials, are considered. The treatment of such systems cannot start with the standard approximations such as Hartree, Hartree-Fock or Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov approximations because of non-integrability of the interaction potentials leading to divergences. It is shown that the iterative procedure for Green functions can be rearranged so that the starting approximation takes into account regularizing atomic correlations. Then all the following approximation orders contain only the regularized interaction potential producing no divergences. The method of constructing the regularizing correlation function is suggested, based on the solution of the scattering equation in the form of asymptotic series at short distance, which can be extrapolated to arbitrary spatial variables by means of self-similar approximation theory. Regularizing correlation functions for several kinds of atomic systems are exemplified.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of the optical pumping process in Nitrogen-Vacancy centers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Medina, Sérgio R. Muniz, Elisa I. Goettems, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto</p>
            <p>The optical pumping process is a fundamental tool for quantum protocols using the electronic and nuclear spins in the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers platform. In this work, we explore the process of electronic spin polarization through optical pumping from a thermodynamic perspective. We identify the sources of work and heat and show that the heat current is direct related to the experimentally accessible fluorescence of the NV center. We also show that the polarization of the electronic spin depends on the amount of work that is provided to the system by the laser pump. Moreover, we study the von Neumann entropy change in the process. We demonstrate that the entropy can be separated into two contributions: one due to the heat produced and the other due to the work provided, which is a consequence of the non-unitary nature of the pumping process. Finally, we show that increasing the power of the laser results in the increasing of the entropy of the final state, which hinders the polarization efficiency.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the interaction dynamics of a four-level tripod-type atomic system coupled to a q-deformed binomial field state within a Kerr-medium. The interaction model incorporates time-dependent coupling parameter and detuning parameter, providing a more adaptable framework for describing atom-field interactions. Special focus is placed on examining how the q-deformation, time-dependent coupling parameter, detuning parameter and Kerr nonlinearity affect the system's fidelity properties and linear entropy dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the effects of the considered parameters have a significant impact on atom-field entanglement and fidelity. These findings offer valuable insights into controlled quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum information processing and nonlinear quantum optics.</p>

This device comprises a chain of asymmetric kinetic inductance grids designed to deliver efficient three-wave mixing nonlinearity. We demonstrate high efficient coherent conversion among broadly distributed modes, and the mode frequency is continuously tunable by controlling the external magnetic field strength, making it ideally suited for quantum computing and communication applications requiring flexible and efficient frequency conversion.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth ions in bulk crystals are excellent solid-state quantum systems in quantum information science, owing to the exceptional optical and spin coherence properties. However, the weak fluorescence of single rare-earth ions present a significant challenge for scalability, necessitating the integration into micro-cavities. Thin films serve as a promising material platform for the integration, yet the fabrication without compromising the properties of the materials and rare-earth ions remains challenging. In this work, we fabricate micrometer-thin yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) films from bulk crystals using ion implantation techniques. The resulting films preserve the single-crystalline structure of the original bulk crystal. Notably, the embedded rare-earth ions are photo-stable and exhibit bulk-like spin coherence properties. Our results demonstrate the compatibility of bulk-like spin properties with the thin-film fabrication technique, facilitating the efficient integration of rare-earth ions into on-chip photonic devices and advancing the applications of rare-earth ions systems in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Two-party entanglement distribution in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Na Li, Yang Zhao, Wen-Long Ma, Z. D. Wang, Yan-Kui Bai</p>
            <p>Entanglement distribution is a fundamental property in quantum many-body physics, but the effect of long-range interactions on the distribution has not been fully understood. Here, we study long-range two-party entanglement (TPE) and explore its distribution properties in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions(ELRIs and PLRIs). In the thermodynamic limit case with the ELRIs, the TPE quantified by two-qubit concurrence decays exponentially along with two-site distance and the long-range concurrences can indicate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. We present a fine-grained entanglement distribution relations among the entanglement truncation length, total concurrences and two-tangles in the infinite spin chains. Moreover, in the finite XXZ chain with the more common PLRIs, the TPE decays algebraically along with the two-spin distance, and the total concurrence can exhibit a piecewise function with respect to total two-tangles. These new presented TPE distribution relations can be regarded as the generalization of Koashi-Bužek-and-Imoto bound for the long-range quantum models, and have potential applications in quantum information processing.</p>

Our approach integrates the qubit-ADAPT method with unrestricted orbital optimization in an active space framework. To accurately measure the necessary spin one-electron reduced density matrices on current hardware, we employ a combination of error mitigation, error suppression, and post-selection, including our in-house developed ansatz-based readout and gate error mitigation. The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step towards leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multi-method error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</p>

            <h2>Eigen-SNAP gate for photonic qubits in a cavity-transmon system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus Meschede, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.</p>

            <p>On-chip micro-cavities with embedded quantum emitters provide an excellent platform for high-performance quantum technologies. A major difficulty for such devices is overcoming the detrimental effects of fluctuations in the device dimensions caused by the limitations of the fabrication processes. We present a fully tunable system based on a 1D photonic-crystal cavity with an embedded quantum dot, which enables tuning of both the quantum dot emission energy and the cavity mode wavelength. A micro-electromechanical cantilever is used to tune the cavity mode wavelength via index modulation and the quantum-confined Stark effect is used to tune the quantum dot emission energy, mitigating the effect of fabrication imperfections. To demonstrate the operation of the device, a maximum, voltage-controllable cavity tuning range of $\Delta \lambda = 1.8$ nm is observed. This signal is measured at the end of a bus waveguide which side-couples to the cavity, enabling the coupling of multiple cavities to a common waveguide, a key requirement for scale-up in these systems. Additionally, a quantum dot is tuned into resonance with the cavity mode, exhibiting an enhanced emission rate with a resolution limited Purcell factor of $F_P = 3.5$.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</p>

            <h2>Exponentially accurate open quantum simulation via randomized dissipation with minimal ancilla</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jumpei Kato, Kaito Wada, Kosuke Ito, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding complex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum algorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short circuit depth in terms of accuracy $\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all possible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space complexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important challenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general Lindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable estimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a minimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor expansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit compilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump operator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 + \lceil \log M \rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at most $M$ Pauli strings. Furthermore, the gate complexity depends on neither the number of terms in Hamiltonian nor the number of jump operators, owing to the random compilation. This work represents a significant step towards making open quantum system simulations more feasible on early fault-tolerant quantum computing devices.</p>

            <p>The goal of this article is to review developments regarding the use of ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators. Special emphasis is placed on relativistic quantum phenomena, which are presumably most interesting for the audience of this journal. After a brief introduction into the main idea of quantum simulators and the basic physics of ultra-cold atoms, relativistic quantum phenomena of linear fields are discussed, including Hawking radiation, the Unruh effect, cosmological particle creation, the Gibbons-Hawking and Ginzburg effects, super-radiance, Sauter-Schwinger and Breit-Wheeler pair creation, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. After that, the focus is shifted to phenomena of non-linear fields, such as the sine-Gordon model, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, false-vacuum decay, and quantum back-reaction. In order to place everything into proper context, the basic underlying mechanisms of these phenomena are briefly recapitulated before their simulators are discussed. Even though effort is made to provide a review as fair as possible, there can be co claim of completeness and the selection as well as the relative weights of the topics may well reflect the personal view and taste of the author.</p>

            <p>Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the current work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding BBGKY hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the ZNE method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE we obtain an average reduction of the error by 18.2% and 52.8% for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-preserved transport of excitations in Rydberg-dressed atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panpan Li, Jing Qian, Weiping Zhang</p>
            <p>To transport high-quality quantum state between two distant qubits through one-dimensional spin chains, the perfect state transfer (PST) method serves as the first choice, due to its natively perfect transfer fidelity that is independent of the system dimension. However, the PST requires a precise modulation of the local pulse parameters as well as an accurate timing of dynamic evolution, and is thus very sensitive to variations in practice. Here, we propose a protocol for achieving quantum-preserved transport of excitations using an array of Rydberg-dressed atoms, enabled by optimal control of minimally global parameters. By treating the weak coupling of two marginal array atoms as a perturbation, an effective spin-exchange model with highly tunable interactions between the external weak and the inner strong driving atoms can be established, which allows for coherent excitation transfer even with large atomic position fluctuation. We furthermore show that the existence of long-time excitation propagation unattainable for systems under antiblockade facilitation conditions. Our results highlight an easily-implemented scheme for studying the dynamics of spin systems using Rydberg atoms and may guide the avenue to the engineering of complex many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum squeezed states, with reduced quantum noise, have been widely utilized in quantum sensing and quantum error correction applications. However, generating and manipulating these nonclassical states with a large squeezing degree typically requires strong nonlinearity, which inevitably induces additional decoherence that diminishes the overall performance. Here, we demonstrate the generation and amplification of squeezed states in a superconducting microwave cavity with weak Kerr nonlinearity. By subtly engineering an off-resonant microwave drive, we observe cyclic dynamics of the quantum squeezing evolution for various Fock states |N> with N up to 6 in displaced frame of the cavity. Furthermore, we deterministically realize quantum squeezing amplification by alternately displacing the Kerr oscillator using the Trotterization technique, achieving a maximum squeezing degree of 14.6 dB and squeezing rate of 0.28 MHz. Our hardware-efficient displacement-enhanced squeezing operations provide an alternative pathway for generating large squeezed states, promising potential applications in quantum-enhanced sensing and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Unipolar light pulses with a non-zero electric area due to the unidirectional action on charged particles can be used for the ultrafast control of the properties of quantum systems. To control atomic properties in an efficient way, it is necessary to vary the temporal shape of the pulses used. This has led to the problem of obtaining pulses of an unusual shape, such as a rectangular one. A number of new phenomena, not possible with conventional multi-cycle pulses, were discovered by analyzing the interaction of such unipolar pulses with matter. These include the formation of dynamic microcavities at each resonant transition of a multilevel medium when such pulses collide with the medium. In this work, we compare the behavior of dynamic microcavities in a two-level and a three-level medium when unipolar pulses of unusual shape (rectangular) are collided with the medium. We do this on the basis of the numerical solution of the system for the density matrix of the medium and the wave equation for the electric field. Medium parameters correspond to atomic hydrogen. It is shown that for rectangular pulses in a three-level medium, the dynamics of the cavities can be very different from the two-level model, as opposed to pulses of other shapes (e.g. Gaussian shape). When the third level of the medium is taken into account, the self-induced transparency-like regime disappears. Differences in the dynamics of resonators in a three-level medium are revealed when the pulses behave like 2{\pi} pulses of self-induced transparency.</p>

We demonstrate that using TMSTS enhances the extracted work, joint-detection signal-to-noise ratio in QI, and correlation coefficients for QKD by approximately $\bar{n}_{\rm th}$ times relative to initializing the idler-signal system with a TMSVS. These findings highlight the potential of TMSTS for improving correlation detection in quantum protocols, with significant implications for noise resilience in QI and QKD.</p>

            <p>The energy level degeneracies, also known as exceptional points (EPs), are crucial for comprehending emerging phenomena in materials and enabling innovative functionalities for devices. Since EPs were proposed over half a century age, only two types of EPs have been experimentally discovered, revealing intriguing phases of materials such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals. These discoveries have showcased numerous exotic topological properties and novel applications, such as unidirectional energy transfer. Here we report the observation of a novel type of EP, named the Dirac EP, utilizing a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Two of the eigenvalues are measured to be degenerate at the Dirac EP and remain real in its vicinity. This exotic band topology associated with the Dirac EP enables the preservation of the symmetry when passing through, and makes it possible to achieve adiabatic evolution in non-Hermitian systems. We examined the degeneracy between the two eigenstates by quantum state tomography, confirming that the degenerate point is a Dirac EP rather than a Hermitian degeneracy. Our research of the distinct type of EP contributes a fresh perspective on dynamics in non-Hermitian systems and is potentially valuable for applications in quantum control in non-Hermitian systems and the study of the topological properties of EP.</p>

            <p>We offer a theoretical perspective on simulation and engineering of polaritonic conical-intersection-driven singlet-fission (SF) materials. We begin by examining fundamental models, including Tavis-Cummings and Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonians, exploring how disorder, non-Hermitian effects, and finite temperature conditions impact their dynamics, setting the stage for studying conical intersections and their crucial role in SF. Using rubrene as an example and applying the numerically accurate Davydov-Ansatz methodology, we derive dynamic and spectroscopic responses of the system and demonstrate key mechanisms capable of SF manipulation, viz. cavity-induced enhancement/weakening/suppression of SF, population localization on the singlet state via engineering of the cavity-mode excitation, polaron/polariton decoupling, collective enhancement of SF. We outline unsolved problems and challenges in the field, and share our views on the development of the future lines of research. We emphasize the significance of careful modeling of cascades of polaritonic conical intersections in high excitation manifolds and envisage that collective geometric phase effects may remarkably affect the SF dynamics and yield. We argue that microscopic interpretation of the main regulatory mechanisms of polaritonic conical-intersection-driven SF can substantially deepen our understanding of this process, thereby providing novel ideas and solutions for improving conversion efficiency in photovoltaics.</p>

            <h2>Demonstrating anyonic non-Abelian statistics with a minimal $d = 6$ qudit lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucy Byles, Ewan Forbes, Jiannis K. Pachos</p>
            <p>Quantum double models provide a natural framework for realising anyons by manipulating a lattice of qudits, which can be directly encoded in quantum simulators. In this work, we consider a lattice of $d=6$ qudits that give rise to $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{S}_3)$ non-Abelian anyons. We present a method that demonstrates the non-commutativity of the braiding and fusion evolutions solely by utilising the operators that create and measure anyons. Furthermore, we provide a dense coding scheme where only two qudits are sufficient to determine the anyonic braiding and fusion matrices. The minimal resource requirement of our approach offers a viable blueprint for demonstrating the non-Abelian nature of anyons in various quantum platforms, including optical, atomic, and solid-state systems, where higher-spin states can be effectively encoded. This work represents a foundational step towards the realisation of non-Abelian quantum error-correcting codes.</p>

            <p>These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Lindblad many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio M. García-García, Zhongling Lu, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a hybrid bidirectional controlled quantum communication protocol between two parties, initiated by a Mentor. Initially, the two main parties and the controller do not share a common quantum entanglement; instead, each party shares entanglement separately with the Mentor. The Mentor's actions create entanglement among the two parties and the controller. The protocol operates deterministically in the absence of environmental noise. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of various types of noises on the protocol, calculate the fidelity, and study how fidelity varies with different parameters. We also provide a theoretical description of the generation of the initial entangled channel used in the protocol. The quantum circuits for entanglement generation and also of the entire protocol are presented. To verify the protocol, these quantum circuits are executed on a real IBM quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Reassessing the boundary between classical and nonclassicalfor individual quantum processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujie Zhang, David Schmid, Yìlè Yīng, Robert W. Spekkens</p>
            <p>There is a received wisdom about where to draw the boundary between classical and nonclassical for various types of quantum processes. For instance, for multipartite states, it is the divide between separable and entangled, for channels, the divide between entanglement-breaking and not, for sets of measurements, the divide between compatible and incompatible, and for assemblages, the divide between steerable and unsteerable. However, no unified justification of these placements of the classical-nonclassical divide has been proposed. That is, although each might be motivated by some notion of what it means to be classically explainable, it is not the same notion for all of them. One well-motivated notion of classical explainability is the one based on generalized noncontextuality: a set of circuits is classically explainable if the statistics they generate can be realized by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. In this work, we show that this notion can be leveraged to define a classical-nonclassical divide for individual quantum processes of arbitrary type. A set of measurements is judged to be classical if and only if a particular set of circuits -- the one obtained by contracting these measurements with every possible quantum state -- is classically explainable in the sense just articulated. We begin the task of characterizing where the classical-nonclassical divide lies according to this proposal for a variety of different types of processes. In particular, we show that all of the following are judged to be nonclassical: every entangled state, every set of incompatible measurements, every non-entanglement-breaking channel, every steerable assemblage. However, it also judges certain subsets of the complementary classes to be nonclassical, i.e., certain separable states, compatible sets of measurements, entanglement-breaking channels, and unsteerable assemblages.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Schrodinger bridges: large deviations and time-symmetric ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olga Movilla Miangolarra, Ralph Sabbagh, Tryphon T. Georgiou</p>
            <p>Quantum counterparts of Schrodinger's classical bridge problem have been around for the better part of half a century. During that time, several quantum approaches to this multifaceted classical problem have been introduced. In the present work, we unify, extend, and interpret several such approaches through a classical large deviations perspective. To this end, we consider time-symmetric ensembles that are pre- and post-selected before and after a Markovian experiment is performed. The Schrodinger bridge problem is that of finding the most likely joint distribution of initial and final outcomes that is consistent with obtained endpoint results. The derived distribution provides quantum Markovian dynamics that bridge the observed endpoint states in the form of density matrices. The solution retains its classical structure in that density matrices can be expressed as the product of forward-evolving and backward-evolving matrices. In addition, the quantum Schrodinger bridge allows inference of the most likely distribution of outcomes of an intervening measurement with unknown results. This distribution may be written as a product of forward- and backward-evolving expressions, in close analogy to the classical setting, and in a time-symmetric way. The derived results are illustrated through a two-level amplitude damping example.</p>

            <p>The goal of benchmarking is to determine how far the output of a noisy system is from its ideal behavior; this becomes exceedingly difficult for large quantum systems where classical simulations become intractable. A common approach is to turn to circuits comprised of elements of the Clifford group (e.g., CZ, CNOT, $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ gates), which probe quantum behavior but are nevertheless efficient to simulate classically. However, there is some concern that these circuits may overlook error sources that impact the larger Hilbert space. In this manuscript, we show that for a broad class of error models these concerns are unwarranted. In particular, we show that, for error models that admit noise tailoring by Pauli twirling, the diamond norm and fidelity of any generic circuit is well approximated by the fidelities of proxy circuits composed only of Clifford gates. We discuss methods for extracting the fidelities of these Clifford proxy circuits in a manner that is robust to errors in state preparation and measurement and demonstrate these methods in simulation and on IBM Quantum's fleet of deployed heron devices.</p>

            <p>We establish an isomorphism between quantum circuits and a subspace of polyatomic molecules, which suggests that molecules can be used as descriptors of quantum circuits for quantum machine learning. Our numerical results show that the performance of quantum circuits for quantum support vector machines can be characterized by dimensionality-reduced molecular fingerprints as well as by the size of the largest and smallest Gershgorin circles derived from the Coulomb matrices of the corresponding molecules. This can be used to restrict the search space for the compositional optimization of quantum circuits. We show that a high accuracy of a quantum algorithm can be achieved with high probability by sampling from a specific set of molecules. This work implies that quantum ansatz optimization can benefit from advances in cheminformatics and suggests an approach to identify key elements that enhance the accuracy of a quantum algorithm by mapping quantum circuits onto molecules and exploring correlations between physical properties of molecules and circuit performance.</p>

            <p>Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) and an extended protocol known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) have emerged as promising algorithms to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation with noisy quantum computers. In QSCI/SQD a quantum circuit is repeatedly prepared on the quantum device, and measured configurations form a subspace of the many-body Hilbert space in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized classically. For the dissociation of N$_2$ and a model $\mathrm{[2Fe-2S]}$ cluster (correlating 10 electrons in 26 orbitals and 30 electrons in 20 orbitals, respectively) we show that a non-perturbative stochastic approach, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), using truncated SQD trial wavefunctions obtained from quantum hardware can recover a substantial amount (e.g., O(100) mHa) of correlation energy and alleviate the possible sampling redundancy of the QSCI/SQD procedure. Extrapolation of the ph-AFQMC energy versus the energy variance of the SQD trial wavefunctions has the potential to further improve the energy accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Todd A. Brun, Leonard Mlodinow</p>
            <p>We show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose lattice quantum cellular automata theories derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space but a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the quantum cellular automaton theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of quantum cellular automata, and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of quantum cellular automata seems to require a nonzero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.</p>

            <h2>Digital Zero-Noise Extrapolation with Quantum Circuit Unoptimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske, Vincent Russo</p>
            <p>Quantum circuit unoptimization is an algorithm that transforms a quantum circuit into a different circuit that uses more gate operations while maintaining the same unitary transformation. We demonstrate that this method can implement digital zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a quantum error mitigation technique. By employing quantum circuit unoptimization as a form of circuit folding, noise can be systematically amplified. The key advantages of this approach are twofold. First, its ability to generate an exponentially increasing number of distinct circuit variants as the noise level is amplified, which allows noise averaging over many circuit instances with slightly different circuit structure which mitigates the effect of biased error propagation because of the significantly altered circuit structure from quantum circuit unoptimization, or highly biased local noise on a quantum processor. Second, quantum circuit unoptimization by design resists circuit simplification back to the original unmodified circuit, making it plausible to use ZNE in contexts where circuit compiler optimization is applied server-side. We evaluate the effectiveness of quantum circuit unoptimization as a noise-scaling method for ZNE in two test cases using depolarizing noise numerical simulations: random quantum volume circuits, where the observable is the heavy output probability, and QAOA circuits for the (unweighted) maximum cut problem on random 3-regular graphs, where the observable is the cut value. We show that using quantum circuit unoptimization to perform ZNE can approximately recover signal from noisy quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>The advancement of classical machine learning is inherently linked to the establishment and progression of classical dataset. In quantum machine learning (QML), there is an analogous imperative for the development of quantum entangled datasets comprised with huge quantity and high quality.

This paper is dedicated to provide a method for generating mixed-state datasets for entangled-separable classification tasks. This method is based on supervised quantum machine learning and the concentratable entanglement measures. It furthers the assembly of quantum entangled datasets, inspires the discovery of new entanglement criteria with both classical and quantum machine learning, and provides a valuable resource for benchmarking QML models, thereby opening new avenues for exploring the rich structure of quantum entanglement in mixed states. Additionally, we benchmark several machine learning models using this dataset, offering guidance and suggestions for the selection of QML models.</p>

            <h2>Weak-coupling bound states in semi-infinite topological waveguide QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Savannah Garmon, Gonzalo Ordonez, Kenichi Noba</p>
            <p>A striking feature of cavity quantum electrodynamics is the existence of atom-photon bound states, which typically form when the coupling between the atom and its environment are strong enough that after de-excitation the atom can ``grab'' an emitted photon and re-absorb it, resulting in a virtual cloud surrounding the atom. Here we will demonstrate the existence of bound states that instead form in the case of weak coupling. Specifically, we show that when a quantum emitter is weakly coupled to a structured reservoir exhibiting topologically-protected surface states, hybridizations between these states and the emitter can form, resulting in mid-gap bound states. We illustrate this using a semi-infinite extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as our reservoir. First, we diagonalize the bare semi-infinite SSH chain and reveal a winding number that predicts only the edge state on the finite side of the chain survives the semi-infinite extension. Then, after coupling the quantum emitter to this end of the chain, we analyze the modified emitter spectrum and reveal the existence of bound states in three parameter regions. Two of these represent the usual strong-coupling bound states, while the third gives the weak-coupling bound states with eigenvalue appearing in the SSH band gap and which exhibit partial sublattice localization. We demonstrate that oscillations between the weak-coupling bound states can be used to transfer the particle from the emitter into the lattice in a predictable and reversible manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miaomiao Wei, Huatang Tan</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present a scheme for remotely generating large-size motional Schrödinger cat states in cavity optomechanical (OM) systems with non-Gaussian quantum steering of continuous variables. We consider that the output field from the OM cavity undergoes three typical kinds of multiphoton operations: multiphoton subtraction, multiphoton addition, or multiphoton catalysis, followed by homodyne detection. We first demonstrate that these multiphoton operations can lead to non-Gaussian OM quantum steerable correlations, which are unveiled by the subsequent homodyne detection with a Fisher-information-based steering criterion. It is found that the non-Gaussian steering is obviously enhanced with an increasing number $n$ of photons in the multiphoton operations, which, as we show, fails to be revealed with the well-known Reid's steering criterion. It therefore suggests that the Fisher-information-based criterion is more effective for witnessing non-Gaussian quantum steering. We next show that the strong OM steering enables the remote preparation of large-size Schrödinger odd or even cat states of the mechanical oscillator by the homodyne detection. Accordingly, the amplitudes of the cat states also increase significantly with the photon number $n$, particularly in the cases of multiphoton subtraction and addition. Our results reveal the properties of non-Gaussian steering generated by multiphoton operations, and the large cat states of macroscopic mechanical resonators hold promise for fundamental tests in quantum mechanics and practical applications in quantum science.</p>

            <p>When a high-energy particle, such as a $\gamma$-ray or muon, impacts the substrate of a superconducting qubit chip, large numbers of electron-hole pairs and phonons are created. The ensuing dynamics of the electrons and holes changes the local offset-charge environment for qubits near the impact site. The phonons that are produced have energy above the superconducting gap in the films that compose the qubits, leading to quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting ground state when the phonons impinge on the qubit electrodes. An elevated density of quasiparticles degrades qubit coherence, leading to errors in qubit arrays. Because these pair-breaking phonons spread throughout much of the chip, the errors can be correlated across a large portion of the array, posing a significant challenge for quantum error correction. In order to study the dynamics of $\gamma$-ray impacts on superconducting qubit arrays, we use a $\gamma$-ray source outside the dilution refrigerator to controllably irradiate our devices. By using charge-sensitive transmon qubits, we can measure both the offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning due to the $\gamma$ irradiation at different doses. We study correlations between offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning for different qubits in the array and compare this with numerical modeling of charge and phonon dynamics following a $\gamma$-ray impact. We thus characterize the poisoning footprint of these impacts and quantify the performance of structures for mitigating phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning.</p>

            <p>Solving short and long time dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems is one of the main challenges of both atomic and condensed matter physics. For locally interacting closed systems, the dynamics of local observables can always be expanded into (pseudolocal) eigenmodes of the Liouvillian, so called dynamical symmetries. They come in two classes - transient operators, which decay in time and perpetual operators, which either oscillate forever or stay the same (conservation laws). These operators provide a full characterization of the dynamics of the system. Deriving these operators, apart from a very limited class of models, has not been possible. Here, we present a method to numerically and analytically derive some of these dynamical symmetries in infinite closed systems by introducing a naturally emergent open boundary condition on the Krylov chain. This boundary condition defines a partitioning of the Krylov space into system and environment degrees of freedom, where non-local operators make up an effective bath for the local operators. We demonstrate the practicality of the method on some numerical examples and derive analytical results in two idealized cases. Our approach lets us directly relate the operator growth hypothesis to thermalization and exponential decay of observables in chaotic systems.</p>

            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.</p>

We find that the thermal rectification is high in the regime of weak magnon-photon hybridization strength and large magnon-drive. Moreover, this driving and the system parameters could serve as experimental knobs to tune the thermodynamic properties of the magnon-photon system, as we demonstrate for the rectification parameter tunable by the drive in its entire physical range. The results from this research would provide very useful insight into the design of quantum thermal machines with a driven magnon-photon system.</p>

Using the Markov-Dobrushin inequality, we establish conditions for infinite-volume states and introduce ergodic and mixing MPS.

We derive the radial wave equation corresponding to the relativistic Dirac equation and subsequently obtain analytical solutions for the energy levels and wave functions of the fermionic field within our chosen framework. Our analysis reveals that various parameters, including geometric topology, the cosmological constant, and quantum numbers, play significant roles in determining the eigenvalue solution of the quantum particles. Specifically, we demonstrate that the presence of the topological parameter disrupts the degeneracy of the energy spectrum.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirko Poljak</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection. Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to host MZMs. We employ eigenspectra analysis and quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states, transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</p>

            <h2>Time- and frequency-resolved dynamics of resonant two-photon terahertz quantum cascade lasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder</p>
            <p>Two-photon terahertz (THz) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) can immensely improve the conventional applications of THz frequency sources and open windows to new applications due to their ability to generate quantum-entangled twin photon beams. The rich intrinsic non-linearity in a two-photon THz QCL arises from cascaded photon transitions, leading to time-resolved and frequency-resolved dynamics that are less predictable. This work investigates the time- and frequency-resolved dynamics of a resonant two-photon THz QCL by numerically solving the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations. Our findings indicate that the output intensity is significantly higher, and the emission spectra are much broader in a two-photon THz QCL than in a conventional one-photon THz QCL. Additionally, a pronounced Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) instability onsets for a resonant two-photon QCL at a smaller pumping current. We also observe an increase in the number of lasing modes, as well as a higher power per line in a resonant two-photon QCL. Furthermore, Rabi splitting is observed in the emission spectra at high pumping currents.</p>

            <p>Accelerating quantum dynamical simulations with quantum computing has received considerable attention but remains a significant challenge. In variational quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics, designing an expressive and shallow-depth parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is a key difficulty. Here, we proposed a multi-set variational quantum dynamics algorithm (MS-VQD) tailored for nonadiabatic dynamics involving multiple electronic states. MS-VQD employs multiple PQCs to represent the electronic-nuclear coupled wavefunction, with each circuit adapting to the motion of nuclear wavepacket on a specific potential energy surface. By simulating excitation energy transfer dynamics in molecular aggregates described by the Frenkel-Holstein model, we demonstrated that MS-VQD achieves the same accuracy as traditional VQD while requiring significantly shallower PQCs. Notably, its advantage increases with the number of electronic states, making it suitable for simulating nonadiabatic quantum dynamics in complex molecular systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nithin Raveendran, David Declercq, Bane Vasić</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is critical for practical realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing, and recently proposed families of quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code are prime candidates for advanced QEC hardware architectures and implementations. This paper focuses on the finite-length QLDPC code design criteria, specifically aimed at constructing degenerate quasi-cyclic symmetric lifted-product (LP-QLDPC) codes. We describe the necessary conditions such that the designed LP-QLDPC codes are guaranteed to have a minimum distance strictly greater than the minimum weight stabilizer generators, ensuring superior error correction performance on quantum channels. The focus is on LP-QLDPC codes built from quasi-cyclic base codes belonging to the class of type-I protographs, and the necessary constraints are efficiently expressed in terms of the row and column indices of the base code. Specifically, we characterize the combinatorial constraints on the classical quasi-cyclic base matrices that guarantee construction of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes. Minimal examples and illustrations are provided to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the code construction approach. The row and column partition constraints derived in the paper simplify the design of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes and can be incorporated into existing classical and quantum code design approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikka Stasiuk, Norbert Lütkenhaus, Ernest Y.-Z. Tan</p>
            <p>Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) aims to mitigate adversarial exploitation of imperfections in quantum devices, by providing an approach for secret key distillation with modest security assumptions. Advantage distillation, a two-way communication procedure in error correction, has proven effective in raising noise tolerances in both device-dependent and device-independent QKD. Previously, device-independent security proofs against IID collective attacks were developed for an advantage distillation protocol known as the repetition-code protocol, based on security conditions involving the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, there exists a gap between the sufficient and necessary security conditions, which hinders the calculation of tight noise-tolerance bounds based on the fidelity. We close this gap by presenting an alternative proof structure that replaces the fidelity with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a distinguishability measure that arises in symmetric hypothesis testing. Working in the IID collective attacks model, we derive matching sufficient and necessary conditions for the repetition-code protocol to be secure (up to a natural conjecture regarding the latter case) in terms of the quantum Chernoff divergence, hence indicating that this serves as the relevant quantity of interest for this protocol. Furthermore, using this security condition we obtain some improvements over previous results on the noise tolerance thresholds for DIQKD. Our results provide insight into a fundamental question in quantum information theory regarding the circumstances under which DIQKD is possible.</p>

            <p>An operational (measurement based) scheme that connects measurement invasiveness and the presence of non-classical memory effects in open quantum systems is defined. Its underlying theoretical basis relies on a non-invasive measurability of (memoryless) quantum Markovian dynamics when the corresponding observable is diagonal in the same basis as the system density matrix. In contrast, violation of this property can be related to intrinsic non-classical memory effects. Related conditions for violation of Leggett-Garg inequality due to quantum memory effects emerge from this perspective. The developed approach applies to open quantum dynamics whose time-evolution is derived from a full unitary (microscopic) description, stochastic Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as for a broad class of non-unitary system-environment models (bipartite Lindblad equations).</p>

            <p>In a nonlocal game, two noncommunicating players cooperate to convince a referee that they possess a strategy that does not violate the rules of the game. Quantum strategies allow players to optimally win some games by performing joint measurements on a shared entangled state, but computing these strategies can be challenging. We present a variational quantum algorithm to compute quantum strategies for nonlocal games by encoding the rules of a nonlocal game into a Hamiltonian. We show how this algorithm can generate a short-depth optimal quantum strategy for a graph coloring game with a quantum advantage. This quantum strategy is then evaluated on fourteen different quantum hardware platforms to demonstrate its utility as a benchmark. Finally, we discuss potential sources of errors that can explain the observed decreased performance of the executed task and derive an expression for the number of samples required to accurately estimate the win rate in the presence of noise.</p>

            <p>We initiate the study of utilizing Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) to solve optimization problems, particularly those non-convex objective functions that present substantial obstacles for traditional gradient descent algorithms. Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically, we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent QLD by making temperature and $\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.</p>

            <p>Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</p>

            <p>Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{O}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{O}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</p>

            <p>Realizing the full potential of quantum computing requires large-scale quantum computers capable of running quantum error correction (QEC) to mitigate hardware errors and maintain quantum data coherence. While quantum computers operate within a two-level computational subspace, many processor modalities are inherently multi-level systems. This leads to occasional leakage into energy levels outside the computational subspace, complicating error detection and undermining QEC protocols. The problem is particularly severe in engineered qubit devices like superconducting transmons, a leading technology for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Addressing this challenge requires effective multi-level quantum system readout to identify and mitigate leakage errors. We propose a scalable, high-fidelity three-level readout that reduces FPGA resource usage by $60\times$ compared to the baseline while reducing readout time by 20\%, enabling faster leakage detection. By employing matched filters to detect relaxation and excitation error patterns and integrating a modular lightweight neural network to correct crosstalk errors, the protocol significantly reduces hardware complexity, achieving a $100\times$ reduction in neural network size. Our design supports efficient, real-time implementation on off-the-shelf FPGAs, delivering a 6.6\% relative improvement in readout accuracy over the baseline. This innovation enables faster leakage mitigation, enhances QEC reliability, and accelerates the path toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> LM Arévalo Aguilar, Rolando Velázquez García</p>
            <p>In this work, firstly, we propose how to experimentally demonstrate the single photon steering phenomenon in a simple way. The quantum steering phenomenon was discovered by Erwin Schrodinger, who reason that the laws of quantum mechanics obliges us to admit that by suitable measurements taken on one of two entangled system, then the state of the other system can be determined and steered. On the other hand, the first proposal about the nonlocal property of a single photon focus on showing the Bell nonlocality by using the single-photon path entanglement. Here, we propose a new experimental scheme that, by incorporating and manipulating the internal degree of freedom (IDF) of the photon, easily demonstrate the nonlocal steering phenomenon of single-photon's states. The experimental set-up that we propose differs from those published in the quantum optics' literature to shown the single photon nonlocality, which generally use the path entanglement of photons and homodyne measurements. Secondly, by incorporating its IDF, we show that the single photon steering and the quantum mechanical interaction-free measurement (QM-IFM) are identical phenomena; we will argue that QM-IFM is just a particular instance of the single-photon steering. In short, both the single photon steering and QM-IFM (being identical phenomena) have a common cause: the nonlocality of the wave function. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that it is possible to produce a nonlocal phenomena by manipulating the single photon internal degree of freedom. On the other hand, this unification between steering and QM-IFM could establish a strong support to counterfactual quantum communication and computation.</p>

In both cases one can still determine some characteristic of the corresponding statistical ensemble, a relation between path probabilities in the classical case, and a relation between the probability amplitudes if a quantum system is involved.</p>

Since the description of this scattering by a relativistic wave equation of the second order is more convenient, we determine a general connection between relativistic wave equations of the first and second orders. For Dirac particles, the relativistic wave equation of the second order is obtained with a correction similar to that to the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is essential for quantum information processing, but is limited by noise. We address this by developing high-yield entanglement distillation protocols with several advancements. (1) We extend the 2-to-1 recurrence entanglement distillation protocol to higher-rate n-to-(n-1) protocols that can correct any single-qubit errors. These protocols are evaluated through numerical simulations focusing on fidelity and yield. We also outline a method to adapt any classical error-correcting code for entanglement distillation, where the code can correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by incorporating Hadamard gates. (2) We propose a constant-depth decoder for stabilizer codes that transforms logical states into physical ones using single-qubit measurements. This decoder is applied to entanglement distillation protocols, reducing circuit depth and enabling protocols derived from high-performance quantum error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this by evaluating the circuit complexity for entanglement distillation protocols based on surface codes and quantum convolutional codes. (3) Our stabilizer entanglement distillation techniques advance quantum computing. We propose a fault-tolerant protocol for constant-depth encoding and decoding of arbitrary states in surface codes, with potential extensions to more general quantum low-density parity-check codes. This protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art reconfigurable atom arrays and surpasses the limits of conventional logarithmic depth encoders. Overall, our study integrates stabilizer formalism, measurement-based quantum computing, and entanglement distillation, advancing both quantum communication and computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scars are rare eigenstates hidden within the chaotic spectra of many-body systems, representing a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Identifying these scars, as well as other non-thermal states in complex quantum systems, remains a significant challenge. Besides exact scar states, the nature of other non-thermal states lacking simple analytical characterization remains an open question. In this study, we employ tools from quantum machine learning -- specifically, (enhanced) quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), to explore hidden non-thermal states in chaotic many-body systems. Our simulations demonstrate that QCNNs achieve over 99% single-shot measurement accuracy in identifying all known scars. Furthermore, we successfully identify new non-thermal states in models such as the xorX model, the PXP model, and the far-coupling Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. In the xorX model, some of these non-thermal states can be approximately described as spin-wave modes of specific quasiparticles. We further develop effective tight-binding Hamiltonians within the quasiparticle subspace to capture key features of these many-body eigenstates. Finally, we validate the performance of QCNNs on IBM quantum devices, achieving single-shot measurement accuracy exceeding 63% under real-world noise and errors, with the aid of error mitigation techniques. Our results underscore the potential of QCNNs to uncover hidden non-thermal states in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum sources with strong correlations are essential but delicate resources in quantum information science and engineering. Decoherence and loss are the primary factors that degrade nonclassical quantum correlations, with scattering playing a role in both processes. In this work, we present a method that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in time-series prediction, to mitigate the detrimental impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our setup involves generating two-mode squeezed light via four-wave mixing in warm rubidium vapor, with one mode subjected to a scatterer to disrupt quantum correlations. Mutual information and intensity-difference squeezing between the two modes are used as metrics for quantum correlations. We demonstrate a 74.7~\% recovery of mutual information and 87.7~\% recovery of two-mode squeezing, despite significant photon loss that would otherwise eliminate quantum correlations. This approach marks a significant step toward recovering quantum correlations from random disruptions without the need for hardware modifications, paving the way for practical applications of quantum protocols.</p>

While quantum digital signatures have been extensively studied, the security still depends on a trusted third-party. To address this limitation and enhance the applicability in real-world scenarios, here we propose a novel quantum digital signature protocol without a trusted third-party to further improve the security. We note that a quantum one-way function can work appropriately in digital signature due to the intrinsic non-cloning property for quantum states. Secret keys in the protocol are constituted by classical private keys and quantum public keys because we assume that no user is trusted in the protocol. We prove that the protocol has information-theoretical unforgeability. Moreover, it satisfies other important secure properties, including asymmetry, undeniability, and expandability.</p>

We complement the surface code with loss detection units (LDU) and analyze its performances by means of circuit-level simulations for two distinct protocols -- the standard LDU and a recently proposed teleportation-based LDU --, focussing on the impact of both atom loss and depolarizing noise on the logical error probability. We introduce and employ a new adaptive decoding procedure that leverages the knowledge of loss locations provided by the LDUs, improving logical error probabilities by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to a naive decoder. For the considered error models, our results demonstrate the existence of an error threshold line that depends linearly on the probabilities of atom loss and of depolarizing errors. For zero depolarizing noise, the atom loss threshold is about $2.6\%$.</p>

            <h2>A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas J. Sorensen, Vitaliy Sultanov, Maria V. Chekhova</p>
            <p>The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose and derive a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.</p>

            <h2>Probing the Quantum Nature of Gravity through Classical Diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliviero Angeli, Sandro Donadi, Giovanni Di Bartolomeo, José Luis Gaona-Reyes, Andrea Vinante, Angelo Bassi</p>
            <p>The question of whether gravity is fundamentally quantum remains one of the most profound open problems in modern physics. A recently explored approach consists in testing gravity's ability to entangle quantum systems, which requires preparing and controlling large-mass quantum states-a formidable experimental challenge. We propose an alternative strategy that circumvents the need for quantum state engineering. We show that if gravity is classical in the sense of being a local operation and classical communication (LOCC) channel, it must necessarily introduce diffusion in the motion of quantum systems. We derive the master equation governing this diffusive dynamics and establish a lower bound on the noise that any classical gravitational interaction must induce. Next, we outline an experimental protocol based on a high-precision torsion pendulum at millikelvin temperatures, showing that the predicted diffusion, if present, is in principle detectable with near-term technology. Our approach offers a novel route to testing the classical vs quantum nature of gravity without requiring macroscopic quantum superpositions or high control of the quantum state of the system, significantly reducing the experimental complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rongchao Ma</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that quantum field excitations can generate packaged entangled states, in which all internal quantum numbers (IQNs) (e.g., electric charge, flavor, and color) are inseparably entangled and constrained to irreducible representation (irrep) blocks. This is a consequence of local gauge invariance and superselection rules. The confinement restricts the net gauge charge to a single superselection sector, thereby excluding cross-sector superpositions but allowing entanglement within one sector. We establish theorems that: \textbf{(1)} Explain how these packaged entangled states naturally arise from quantum field excitations, \textbf{(2)} Show how they remain gauge invariant or transform covariantly within a fixed net-charge sector, and \textbf{(3)} Illustrate how external degrees of freedom (DOFs) (e.g., spin or momentum) can combine with packaged internal charges to yield gauge-invariant entanglement. Finally, we show that spin or momentum measurements on these hybrid states induce a collapse of the internal entanglement.</p>

We derive bounds on the error of the synthesised unitary in terms of bounds on the norm of the noise, and show that for certain noise processes these bounds are tight. We then show that in certain situations, minimising the error is equivalent to finding a geodesic on SU (n) with respect to a Riemannian metric encoding the coupling between the control pulse and the noise process.

            <p>In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akinori Nishino, Naomichi Hatano</p>
            <p>We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</p>

            <p>Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement Rényi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore D. Pace, Ho Tat Lam, Ömer M. Aksoy</p>
            <p>Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove an SPT-LSM theorem: any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in non-interacting Bose gases at thermal equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexej Schelle</p>
            <p>The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</p>

            <h2>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Ueda, Kazuhiro Tatsumi</p>
            <p>Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Yoshimura, Yoh Maekawa, Ryuna Nagayama, Sosuke Ito</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic force and irreversible current are the foundational concepts of classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Entropy production rate is provided by their product in classical systems, ranging from mesoscopic to macroscopic systems. However, there is no complete quantum extension of such a structure that respects quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose anti-Hermitian operators that represent currents and forces accompanied by a gradient structure in open quantum systems described by the quantum master equation. We prove that the entropy production rate is given by the product of the force and current operators, which extends the canonical expression of the entropy production rate in the classical systems. The framework constitutes a comprehensive analogy with the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of discrete classical systems. We also show that the structure leads to the extensions of some results in stochastic thermodynamics: the geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition of entropy production and thermodynamic trade-off relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the dissipation-time uncertainty relation. In discussing the trade-off relations, we will introduce a measure of fluctuation, which we term the quantum diffusivity.</p>

            <p>The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which controls flavor mixing between the three generations of quark fermions, is a key input to the Standard Model of particle physics. In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of $2 \to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.</p>

            <p>The backreaction of quantum degrees of freedom on classical backgrounds is a poorly understood topic in theoretical physics. Most often it is treated within the semiclassical approximation with the help of various ad hoc prescriptions accounting for the effect of quantum excitations on the dynamics of the background. We focus on two popular ones: (i) the mean-field approximation whereby quantum degrees of freedom couple to the classical background via their quantum expectation values; (ii) the (stochastic) Truncated Wigner method whereby the fully coupled system is evolved using classical equations of motion for various randomly sampled initial conditions of the quantum degree of freedom, and a statistical average is performed a posteriori. We evaluate the performance of each method in a simple toy model against a fully quantum mechanical treatment, and identify its regime of validity. We interpret the results in terms of quantum entanglement and loss of classicality of the background.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishan Saraswat</p>
            <p>We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as a cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</p>

            <p>Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</p>

            <p>We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>The role of exchange interactions in superradiant phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João Pedro Mendonça, Krzysztof Jachymski, Yao Wang</p>
            <p>The Dicke model is a central platform for exploring strong light-matter interaction and its superradiant properties, with implications for emerging quantum technologies. Recognizing that realistic qubits inherently experience direct interactions, we investigate the influence of both isotropic and anisotropic spin-spin couplings on the Dicke paradigm. In the strong coupling regime--where large photon populations challenge conventional numerical techniques--we developed a hybrid numerical method tailored for this problem, which demonstrates high accuracy and rapid convergence in reproducing established Dicke model results. Furthermore, our study reveals that distinct ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions exhibit different orders of phase transitions. Most notably, in the presence of anisotropic interactions, we identify a novel phase where spin order and superradiance coexist, marked by enhanced superradiance with a photon number significantly exceeding that of the conventional Dicke model.</p>

            <h2>Mitigation of birefringence in cavity-based quantum networks using frequency-encoded photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengxi Zhang, Justin Phillips, Inder Monga, Erhan Saglamyurek, Qiming Wu, Hartmut Haeffner</p>
            <p>Atom-cavity systems offer unique advantages for building large-scale distributed quantum computers by providing strong atom-photon coupling while allowing for high-fidelity local operations of atomic qubits. However, in prevalent schemes where the photonic state is encoded in polarization, cavity birefringence introduces an energy splitting of the cavity eigenmodes and alters the polarization states, thus limiting the fidelity of remote entanglement generation. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that encodes the photonic qubit in the frequency degree-of-freedom. The scheme relies on resonant coupling of multiple transverse cavity modes to different atomic transitions that are well-separated in frequency. We numerically investigate the temporal properties of the photonic wavepacket, two-photon interference visibility, and atom-atom entanglement fidelity under various cavity polarization-mode splittings and find that our scheme is less affected by cavity birefringence. Finally, we propose practical implementations in two trapped ion systems, using the fine structure splitting in the metastable D state of $\mathrm{^{40}Ca^{+}}$, and the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of $\mathrm{^{225}Ra^{+}}$. Our study presents an alternative approach for cavity-based quantum networks that is less sensitive to birefringent effects, and is applicable to a variety of atomic and solid-state emitter-cavity interfaces.</p>

            <p>Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined, internal and collective spin squeezing, in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinchao Zhou, Deepak A. Suresh, F. Robicheaux, Chen-Lung Hung</p>
            <p>We experimentally and theoretically study collective emission of a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) in a nanophotonic microring resonator. Due to many cold atoms localized in a small volume, these trapped atoms collectively couple not only to the WGM and but also to the non-guided modes in free space. Through tuning the atom-WGM coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the WGM. For photon emission via the non-guided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady-state states and the timed-Dicke states, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment, respectively. Our observation and methodology could shed light on future explorations of collective emission with densely packed quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic light-matter interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Melting of devil's staircases in the long-range Dicke-Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Alexander Koziol, Anja Langheld, Kai Phillip Schmidt</p>
            <p>We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.</p>

            <h2>Restoring thermalization in long-range quantum magnets with staggered magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Winter, Pietro Brighi, Andreas Nunnenkamp</p>
            <p>Quantum systems with strong long-range interactions are thought to resist thermalization because of their discrete energy spectra. We show that applying a staggered magnetic field to a strong long-range Heisenberg antiferromagnet restores thermalization for a large class of initial states by breaking permutational symmetry. Using self-consistent mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we reveal that the energy spectrum, while composed of discrete subspaces, collectively forms a dense spectrum. The equilibration time is independent of system size and depends only on the fluctuations in the initial state. For initial states at low to intermediate energies, the long-time average aligns with the microcanonical ensemble. However, for states in the middle of the spectrum the long-time average depends on the initial state due to quantum scar-like eigenstates localized at unstable points in classical phase space. Our results can be readily tested on a range of experimental platforms, including Rydberg atoms or optical cavities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germain Tobar, Joshua Foo, Sofia Qvarfort, Fabio Costa, Rivka Bekenstein, Magdalena Zych</p>
            <p>The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions, resulting in non-trivial particle content across these sub-regions. However, accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained far out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The array's response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that photon content from entangled sub-regions of the vacuum causes frequency shifts that are accessible in existing experimental setups. This feasibility stems from the system's unique ability to create coherent superpositions of transmissive and reflective states, providing the first practical platform for directly observing particle content from entangled spatial sub-regions of the electromagnetic field vacuum.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) protects quantum systems against inevitable noises and control inaccuracies, providing a pathway towards fault-tolerant (FT) quantum computation. However, the significant overhead of physical qubits required to encode a single logical qubit poses a major challenge for scalability and practical implementation. Floquet QEC codes, a recent innovation, mitigate this challenge by utilizing time-periodic measurements to introduce additional dynamical logical qubits, thereby enhancing resource efficiency in QEC. Here, we experimentally implement the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code on a superconducting quantum processor. We encode a dynamical logical qubit within a $3\times 3$ lattice of data qubits, alongside a conventional static logical qubit. We demonstrate FT encoding and measurement of the two-qubit logical states and stabilize the states using repeated error detection cycles. Additionally, we showcase universal single-qubit logical gates on the dynamical qubit. By implementing a logical CNOT gate, we entangle the dynamical and static logical qubits, generating an error-detected logical Bell state with a fidelity of 75.9\%. Our results highlight the potential of Floquet codes for scalable and resource-efficient FT quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) provides a compelling approach to quantum information processing, with a short list of physical requirements; however, experimental implementations have faced significant challenges. Itinerant phonons in quantum acoustics, combined with superconducting qubits, offer a compelling alternative to the quantum optics approach. Here we demonstrate key advances in the ability to manipulate and measure acoustic phonon quantum states: First, we demonstrate deterministic phase control of itinerant one- and two-phonon qubit states, measured using an acoustic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We implement phonon phase control using the frequency-dependent scattering of phonon states from a superconducting transmon qubit. The acoustic interferometer used to measure the resulting phonon phase achieves a noise-floor-limited Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference visibility of 98.1%, representing a significant improvement over our previous demonstration. Additionally, we propose and implement a multi-phonon detection scheme that enables coherent conversion between itinerant one- and two-phonon Fock states and transmon qutrit states, transforming for example the Hong-Ou-Mandel two-phonon entangled output state $|02\rangle - |20\rangle$ into the entangled state of two transmons. The tight integration of quantum acoustics with superconducting circuits native to our implementation promises further advances, including deterministic phonon quantum gates with direct applications to quantum computing.</p>

The main results reveal the presence of entangled states according to the wave-number values in each quantum graph and the applied controlled operation. It was possible to determine the criteria for maximal entanglement or separability. In particular, we uncovered the presence of entanglement in a simple system consisting of two simple quantum graphs, with only one edge and a controlled phase.</p>

            <p>Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.</p>

            <p>Quantum computation and quantum simulation require a versatile gate set to optimize circuit compilation for practical applications. However, existing platforms are often limited to specific gate types or rely on parametric couplers to extend their gate set, which compromises scalability. Here, we propose a scalable quantum simulator with an extended gate set based on giant-atom three-level systems, which can be implemented with superconducting circuits. Unlike conventional small atoms, giant atoms couple to the environment at multiple points, introducing interference effects that allow exceptional tunability of their interactions. By leveraging this tunability, our setup supports both CZ and iSWAP gates through simple frequency adjustments, eliminating the need for parametric couplers. This dual-gate capability enhances circuit efficiency, reducing the overhead for quantum simulation. As a demonstration, we showcase the simulation of spin dynamics in dissipative Heisenberg XXZ spin chains, highlighting the setup's ability to tackle complex open quantum many-body dynamics. Finally, we discuss how a two-dimensional extension of our system could enable fault-tolerant quantum computation, paving the way for a universal quantum processor.</p>

            <p>Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes present a promising route to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet systematic strategies for their exploration remain underdeveloped. In this work, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. Besides providing efficient characterizations for demonstrations using Gröbner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem, allowing us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choice of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their inherent link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and offer an efficient method for searching for finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced mathematical structures.</p>

            <p>Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.</p>

            <p>We propose an approach to generative quantum machine learning that overcomes the fundamental scaling issues of variational quantum circuits. The core idea is to use a class of generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits, which we show can be trained efficiently on classical hardware. Although training is classically efficient, sampling from these circuits is widely believed to be classically hard, and so computational advantages are possible when sampling from the trained model on quantum hardware. By combining our approach with a data-dependent parameter initialisation strategy, we do not encounter issues of barren plateaus and successfully circumvent the poor scaling of gradient estimation that plagues traditional approaches to quantum circuit optimisation. We investigate and evaluate our approach on a number of real and synthetic datasets, training models with up to one thousand qubits and hundreds of thousands of parameters. We find that the quantum models can successfully learn from high dimensional data, and perform surprisingly well compared to simple energy-based classical generative models trained with a similar amount of hyperparameter optimisation. Overall, our work demonstrates that a path to scalable quantum generative machine learning exists and can be investigated today at large scales.</p>

Lett. 124, 150502 (2020)] demonstrates a route for enhanced RF-receiver empowered by quantum squeezing and entanglement. In this work, we further explore the quantum advantage of imaging in the weak coupling scenario of the RF-photonic receiver. The proposed imaging receiver applies transducer to upconvert the RF signal to optical to enable high-efficiency connection via low-loss fiber networks. The efficient connection therefore increases the synthetic aperture and improves the resolution of the distributed imaging system. To overcome the challenge from low transduction efficiency in existing devices limited by weak photon interaction, we propose the use of squeezed-state optical sources to suppress the noise. We numerically evaluate the quantum advantage in synthetic aperture radar imaging, where the images are generated from the standard resolution test chart via a Gaussian point spread function with added Gaussian noise. We apply the Wiener filter on the images to restore the objects and find that stronger squeezing significantly improves the quality of the restored image.

In the process of approaching the standard quantum limit, higher demands are placed on detection schemes.

The scheme effectively mitigates the impact of technical noise and can be used to achieve a measurement precision close to the limit set by atomic shot noise in theory. Compared with the superheterodyne method based on transmission detection, our scheme has been experimentally proved to have a sensitivity increase of 5$\sim$6 dB. In this work, the Rydberg dispersion signal amplification mechanism offers a approach to enhance microwave detection sensitivity, which also facilitates deeper investigations into its dynamic processes and further applications of this mechanism in quantum communication and quantum control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiaofeng Liu, Ian Low, Zhewei Yin</p>
            <p>In quantum computing, non-stabilizerness -- the magic -- refers to the computational advantage of certain quantum states over classical computers and is an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. Employing the second order stabilizer Rényi entropy to quantify magic, we study the production of magic states in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) via 2-to-2 scattering processes involving electrons and muons. Considering all 60 stabilizer initial states, which have zero magic, the angular dependence of magic produced in the final states is governed by only a few patterns, both in the non-relativistic and the ultra-relativistic limits. Some processes, such as the low-energy $e^-\mu^-\to e^-\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^-e^+\to e^-e^+$, do not generate magic at all. In most cases the largest magic generated is significantly less than the maximal possible value of $\log (16/7) \approx 0.827$. The only instance where QED is able to generate maximal magic is the low-energy $\mu^-\mu^+\to e^-e^+$, in the limit $m_e/m_\mu \to 0$, which is well approximated in nature. Our results suggest QED, although capable of producing maximally entangled states easily, may not be an efficient mechanism for generating quantum advantages.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement plays an irreplaceable role in various remote quantum information processing tasks. Here we present protocols for generating deterministic and heralded $N$-qubit entangled states across multiple network nodes. By utilizing a pre-shared maximally entangled state and single-qubit operations within an indefinite causal order framework, the multi-qubit entangled state between distant parties can be generated deterministically. The complex entangled state measurements and multiple pre-shared entangled states, are essential in conventional entanglement swapping technique, but are not required in our approach. This greatly reduces the complexity of the quantum circuit and makes it more experimentally feasible. Furthermore, we develop optical architectures to implement these protocols by encoding qubits in polarization degree of freedom. The results indicate that our protocols significantly improve the efficiency of long-distance entanglement generation and provide a practical framework for establishing large-scale quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Light dragging refers to the change in the path of light passing through a moving medium. This effect enables accurate detection of very slow speeds of light, which have prominent applications in state transfer, quantum gate operations, and quantum memory implementations. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate the existence of the light-dragging effect in an optomechanical system (OMS) for the first time. The origin of this key factor arises from the nonlinear effects linked to optomechanical-induced transparency (OMIT). Hence, we observe prominent effects in the group and refractive indices profile spectra related to optomechanical parameters such as the decay rate of the cavity field, the mirror's damping momentum rate, and mechanical frequency. We find out that lateral light drag depends on the detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This allowed us to change the light's propagation through the optomechanical cavity from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by modifying the probe's detuning. The ability to manipulate and control the light drag through an optomechanical system might be useful in designing novel optical devices and systems with enhanced performance.</p>

            <h2>Critical dynamics and its interferometry in the one-dimensional p-wave-paired Aubry-André-Harper model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Han Zhang, Han-Chuan Kou, Peng Li</p>
            <p>In this work, we focus on the critical dynamics of the one-dimensional quasiperiodic p-wave-paired Aubry-André-Harper model, which exhibits a transition point between the gapped critical and the gapless localized phases. First, we disclose that the dynamical exponent features two distinct plateaus in the gapless localized phase. Besides the plateau with dynamical exponent $z=1.388$ near the transition point, there is a second one with $z=1$ away from the transition point. Then we demonstrate that these two plateaus intrinsically affect the critical dynamics with moderate quench rate by employing both one-way and round-trip quench protocols. In the one-way quench protocol, we clarify that the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) regime consists of two sub-regimes with different KZ exponents, which is a direct consequence of the two-plateau structure of the dynamical exponent. We also diagnose the KZ, pre-saturated, and saturated regimes by varying the quench rate from slow to fast limits. While, in the round-trip quench protocol, we confirm the interference effect of two critical dynamics and show a narrow neck in the oscillatory density of defects. It turns out that the position of the neck depends on the ratio of to-and-fro quench rates and the p-wave superconductivity pairing amplitude. We show how the position of the neck can be used to quantitatively determine the turning point of the two KZ sub-regimes.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Jafari, J. Naji, A. Langari, Vahid Karimipour, Henrik Johannesson</p>
            <p>We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</p>

            <h2>Bounding the computational power of bosonic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Varun Upreti, Ulysse Chabaud</p>
            <p>Bosonic quantum systems operate in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, unlike discrete-variable quantum systems. This distinct mathematical structure leads to fundamental differences in quantum information processing, such as an exponentially greater complexity of state tomography [MMB+24] or a factoring algorithm in constant space [BCCRK24]. Yet, it remains unclear whether this structural difference of bosonic systems may also translate to a practical computational advantage over finite-dimensional quantum computers. Here we take a step towards answering this question by showing that universal bosonic quantum computations can be simulated in exponential time on a classical computer, significantly improving the best previous upper bound requiring exponential memory [CJMM24]. In complexity-theoretic terms, we improve the best upper bound on $\textsf{CVBQP}$ from $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$ to $\textsf{EXP}$. This result is achieved using a simulation strategy based on finite energy cutoffs and approximate coherent state decompositions. While we propose ways to potentially refine this bound, we also present arguments supporting the plausibility of an exponential computational advantage of bosonic quantum computers over their discrete-variable counterparts. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of circuit energy as a resource and discuss why it may act as the fundamental bottleneck in realizing this advantage in practical implementations.</p>

            <p>Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeno Bacciconi, Hernan Xavier, Iacopo Carusotto, Titas Chanda, Marcello Dalmonte</p>
            <p>Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashtakala Meghanath, Subham Das, Bikash K.Behera, Muhammad Attique Khan, Saif Al-Kuwari, Ahmed Farouk</p>
            <p>In transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring safety and reliability in real-time decision-making is essential for successfully deploying autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation networks. However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU† method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate the key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kangyu Zheng, Tianfan Fu, Zhiding Liang</p>
            <p>The biomedical field is beginning to explore the use of quantum machine learning (QML) for tasks traditionally handled by classical machine learning, especially in predicting ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties, which are essential in drug evaluation. However, ADME tasks pose unique challenges for existing quantum computing systems (QCS) frameworks, as they involve both classification with unbalanced dataset and regression problems. These dual requirements make it necessary to adapt and refine current QCS frameworks to effectively address the complexities of ADME predictions. We propose a novel training-free scoring mechanism to evaluate QML circuit performance on imbalanced classification and regression tasks. Our mechanism demonstrates significant correlation between scoring metrics and test performance on imbalanced classification tasks. Additionally, we develop methods to quantify continuous similarity relationships between quantum states, enabling performance prediction for regression tasks. This represents the first comprehensive approach to searching and evaluating QCS circuits specifically for regression applications. Validation on representative ADME tasks-one imbalanced classification and one regression-demonstrates moderate positive correlation between our scoring metrics and circuit performance, significantly outperforming baseline scoring methods that show negligible correlation.</p>

            <h2>Universal Counterdiabatic Driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stewart Morawetz, Anatoli Polkovnikov</p>
            <p>Local counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a systematic way of constructing a control protocol to approximately suppress the excitations resulting from changing some parameter(s) of a quantum system at a finite rate. However, designing CD protocols typically requires knowledge of the original Hamiltonian a priori. In this work, we design local CD driving protocols in Krylov space using only the characteristic local time scales of the system set by e.g. phonon frequencies in materials or Rabi frequencies in superconducting qubit arrays. Surprisingly, we find that convergence of these universal protocols is controlled by the asymptotic high frequency tails of the response functions. This finding hints at a deep connection between the long-time, low frequency response of the system controlling non-adiabatic effects, and the high-frequency response determined by the short-time operator growth and the Krylov complexity, which has been elusive until now.</p>

            <p>Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced quantum frequency estimation by nonlinear scrambling</h2>

            <p>Frequency estimation, a cornerstone of basic and applied sciences, has been significantly enhanced by quantum sensing strategies. Despite breakthroughs in quantum-enhanced frequency estimation, key challenges remain: static probes limit flexibility, and the interplay between resource efficiency, sensing precision, and potential enhancements from nonlinear probes remains not fully understood. In this work, we show that dynamically encoding an unknown frequency in a nonlinear quantum electromagnetic field can significantly improve frequency estimation. To provide a fair comparison of resources, we define the energy cost as the figure of merit for our sensing strategy. We further show that specific higher-order nonlinear processes lead to nonlinear-enhanced frequency estimation. This enhancement results from quantum scrambling, where local quantum information spreads across a larger portion of the Hilbert space. We quantify this effect using the Wigner-Yanase skew information, which measures the degree of noncommutativity in the Hamiltonian structure. Our work sheds light on the connection between Wigner-Yanase skew information and quantum sensing, providing a direct method to optimize nonlinear quantum probes.</p>

            <p>Critical ground states of quantum many-body systems have emerged as vital resources for quantum-enhanced sensing. Traditional methods to prepare these states often rely on adiabatic evolution, which may diminish the quantum sensing advantage. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL)-enhanced critical sensing protocol for quantum many-body systems with exotic phase diagrams. Starting from product states and utilizing QRL-discovered gate sequences, we explore sensing accuracy in the presence of unknown external magnetic fields, covering both local and global regimes. Our results demonstrate that QRL-learned sequences reach the finite quantum speed limit and generalize effectively across systems of arbitrary size, ensuring accuracy regardless of preparation time. This method can robustly achieve Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg limits, even in noisy environments with practical Pauli measurements. Our study highlights the efficacy of QRL in enabling precise quantum state preparation, thereby advancing scalable, high-accuracy quantum critical sensing.</p>

            <p>We present a full exploration of the dynamic diversity inherent in superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intricately coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing a quantized electromagnetic vector potential via the Peierls substitution, this gauge-coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions. These transitions are characterized by the displacement of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum, thereby circumventing the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, the single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and varied spontaneous symmetry breaking. This configuration enables the precise manipulation of superradiant phases in weak coupling regimes, devoid of the quantum fluctuation divergence. Our findings advance the understanding of tunable quantum devices and highlight potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.</p>

In this work, we report on the experimental implementation of a bulk quantum-optical memristor, working with single-rail coherent superposition states in the Fock basis, generated via a resonantly excited quantum dot single-photon source. We demonstrate that the coherence of the input state is preserved by the quantum memristor. Moreover, our modular platform allows investigating the nonlinear behavior arising from a cascade of two quantum memristors, a building block for larger networks of such devices towards the realization of complex neuromorphic quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>Entangled photon pairs are key elements in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. State-of-the-art sources of entangled photons are mainly based on parametric-down conversion from nonlinear crystals, which is probabilistic in nature, and on cascade emission from biexciton quantum dots, which finds difficulties in generating entangled photons in the visible regime. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that polarization-entangled photon pairs can be emitted from two interacting quantum emitters with two-level-system behaviour and perpendicular transition dipole moments. These emitters can represent a large variety of systems (e.g., organic molecules, quantum dots and diamond-color centers) offering a large technological versatility, for example in the spectral regime of the emission. We show that a highly entangled photon pair can be post-selected from this system by including optical filters. Additionally, we verify that the photon entanglement is not significantly affected by small changes in the detection directions and in the orientation between the dipole moments.</p>

            <p>We present a hardware-efficient optimization scheme for quantum chemistry calculations, utilizing the Sampled Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) method. Our algorithm, optimized SQD (SQDOpt), combines the classical Davidson method technique with added multi-basis measurements to optimize a quantum Ansatz on hardware using a fixed number of measurements per optimization step. This addresses the key challenge associated with other quantum chemistry optimization protocols, namely Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which must measure in hundreds to thousands of bases to estimate energy on hardware, even for molecules with less than 20 qubits. Numerical results for various molecules, including hydrogen chains, water, and methane, demonstrate the efficacy of our method compared to classical and quantum variational approaches, and we confirm the performance on the IBM-Cleveland quantum hardware, where we find instances where SQDOpt either matches or exceeds the solution quality of noiseless VQE. A runtime scaling indicates that SQDOpt on quantum hardware is competitive with classical state-of-the-art methods, with a crossover point of 1.5 seconds/iteration for the SQDOpt on quantum hardware and classically simulated VQE with the 20-qubit H$_{12}$ molecule. Our findings suggest that the proposed SQDOpt framework offers a scalable and robust pathway for quantum chemistry simulations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.</p>

            <p>We present quantum phase diagrams for the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model with a linear coupling to a single bosonic mode on the square and triangular lattice. For zero coupling, the ground-state magnetization forms a devil's staircase structure of magnetization plateaux as a function of a longitudinal field. Apart from a paramagnetic superradiant phase with a finite photon density at strong light-matter couplings, the long-range interactions lead to a plethora of intermediate phases that break the translational symmetry and have a finite photon density at the same time. We apply an adaption of the unit-cell-based mean-field calculations, which captures all possible magnetic unit cells up to a chosen extent. Further, we exploit an exact mapping of the non-superradiant phases to an effective Dicke model to calculate upper bounds for phase transitions towards superradiant phases. Finally, to treat quantum fluctuations in a quantitative fashion, we employ a generalized wormhole quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. We discuss how these three methods are used in a cooperative fashion. In the calculated phase diagrams we see several features arising from the long-range interactions: The devil's staircases of distinct magnetically ordered normal phases and non-trivial magnetically ordered superradiant phases beyond the findings for nearest-neighbor interactions. Examples are a superradiant phase with a three-sublattice magnetic order on the square lattice and the superradiant Wigner crystal with four sites per unit cell on the triangular lattice. We find the transition between normal and superradiant phases with the same (different) magnetic order to be of second order with Dicke universality (first order). Further, between superradiant phases we find first-order phase transitions, besides specially highlighted regimes for which we find indications for second-order behavior.</p>

Furthermore, our study reveals that this magnetic criticality extends to a superradiant phase transition within cavity magnonics systems. The magnon-photon interaction results in diverging cavity photon numbers and squeezing in the ground state at the transition points between spin orderings. This investigation not only elucidates the criticality of multi-component squeezed magnons in antiferromagnets, but also proposes cavity photon measurements as a viable method for detecting magnetic phase transitions.</p>

A clear relation with the symmetries of the eigenstates emerges, as well as a wide tunability of the Rabi frequencies by means of the applied bias.

            <p>We investigate the interplay between quantum theory and gravity by exploring gravitational lensing and Einstein ring images in a weak gravitational field induced by a mass source in spatial quantum superposition. We analyze a quantum massless scalar field propagating in two distinct models of gravity: the first quantized Newtonian gravity (QG) model, which generates quantum entanglement between the mass source and other systems, and the Schrödinger-Newton (SN) gravity model, which does not produce entanglement. Visualizing the two-point correlation function of the scalar field, we find that the QG model produces a composition of multiple Einstein rings, reflecting the spatial superposition of the mass source. By contrast, the SN model yields a single deformed ring image, representing a classical spacetime configuration. Furthermore, we introduce a specific quantity named the which-path information indicator and visualize its image. The QG model again reveals multiple Einstein rings, while the image intensity in the SN model notably vanishes. Our findings provide a visual approach to witness gravity-induced entanglement through distinct features in Einstein ring images. This study advances our understanding of quantum effects in general relativistic contexts and establishes a foundation for future studies of other relativistic phenomena.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Ratio</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenichi Konishi, Hans-Thomas Elze</p>
            <p>The concept of the Quantum Ratio was born out of the efforts to find a simple but universal criterion if the center of mass (CM) of an isolated (microscopic or macroscopic) body behaves quantum mechanically or classically, and under which conditions. It is defined as the ratio between the quantum fluctuation range, which is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, and the linear size of the body (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases where the ratio is smaller than unity or much larger than unity, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. An important notion following from the introduction of quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical. This is so even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence (mixed state) and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation is further elaborated, by analyzing some atomic or molecular processes. It may have far-reaching implications on the way quantum mechanics works, e.g., in biological systems.</p>

            <h2>Fast Scrambling in Hyperbolic Ising Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Goksu Can Toga, Abhishek Samlodia, Alexander F. Kemper</p>
            <p>We investigate many-body chaos and scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising model, a mixed-field Ising model living in the background of AdS2. The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Universality in the Anticoncentration of Chaotic Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arman Sauliere, Beatrice Magni, Guglielmo Lami, Xhek Turkeshi, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We establish universal behavior in the anticoncentration properties of random quantum circuits, demonstrating its broad independence from the circuit architecture. Specifically, universality emerges in a certain scaling limit and extends beyond the leading order, incorporating subleading corrections arising from the finite system size $N$. We compute these corrections through exact calculations on ensembles of random tensor network states and corroborate the results with analytical findings in the random phase model. We then identify a heuristic framework for generic brickwork circuits, conjecturing the universality of these corrections. We further support our claim of anticoncentration universality through extensive numerical simulations, capturing the distribution of overlaps for systems up to $N = 64$ qudits and computing collision probabilities for systems up to $N \leq 1024$. Collectively, our results highlight the critical role of finite-size corrections and lead to a thorough understanding of the core phenomenology governing anticoncentration in quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Quantum illumination via frequency-mode-based correlation-to-displacement conversion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Zhibin Ye</p>
            <p>Quantum illumination leverages entanglement to surpass classical target detection, even in high-noise environments. Remarkably, its quantum advantage persists despite entanglement degradation caused by environmental decoherence. A central challenge lies in designing optimal receivers to exploit this advantage, with the correlation-to-displacement conversion module emerging as a promising candidate. However, the practical implementation of the conversion module faces technical hurdles, primarily due to the vast number of modes involved. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a frequency-mode entangled source with matched photon numbers, a heterodyne detection scheme for the returned signals across vast modes, and a cavity-enhanced quantum pulse gate for programmable mode processing. This integrated framework paves the way for the realization of practical quantum illumination systems.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimisation of Traveling Salesperson Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christos Lytrosyngounis, Ioannis Lytrosyngounis</p>
            <p>The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimisation challenge with widespread applications in logistics, operations research, and network design. While classical algorithms effectively solve small to medium-sized instances, they struggle with scalability due to exponential complexity. In this work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages IBM's Qiskit Runtime to integrate quantum optimisation techniques with classical machine learning methods, specifically K-Means clustering and Random Forest classifiers. These machine learning components aid in problem decomposition and noise mitigation, improving the quality of quantum solutions. Experimental results for TSP instances ranging from 4 to 8 cities reveal that the quantum-only approach produces solutions up to 21.7% worse than the classical baseline, while the hybrid method reduces this cost increase to 11.3% for 8 cities. This demonstrates that hybrid approaches improve solution quality compared to purely quantum methods but remain suboptimal compared to classical solvers. Despite current hardware limitations, these results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced methods for combinatorial optimisation, paving the way for future advancements in scalable quantum computing frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Variational Quantum Algorithm with Many-qubit for Optimization Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seongmin Kim, In-Saeng Suh</p>
            <p>Optimization problems are critical across various domains, yet existing quantum algorithms, despite their great potential, struggle with scalability and accuracy due to excessive reliance on entanglement. To address these limitations, we propose variational quantum optimization algorithm (VQOA), which leverages many-qubit (MQ) operations in an ansatz solely employing quantum superposition, completely avoiding entanglement. This ansatz significantly reduces circuit complexity, enhances noise robustness, mitigates Barren Plateau issues, and enables efficient partitioning for highly complex large-scale optimization. Furthermore, we introduce distributed VQOA (DVQOA), which integrates high-performance computing with quantum computing to achieve superior performance across MQ systems and classical nodes. These features enable a significant acceleration of material optimization tasks (e.g., metamaterial design), achieving more than 50$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Additionally, DVQOA efficiently solves quantum chemistry problems and $\textit{N}$-ary $(N \geq 2)$ optimization problems involving higher-order interactions. These advantages establish DVQOA as a highly promising and versatile solver for real-world problems, demonstrating the practical utility of the quantum-classical approach.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement dynamics via Geometric phases in Trapped-ions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dharmaraj Ramachandran, Ganesh H, Radhika Vathsan</p>
            <p>Trapped-ion systems are a leading platform for quantum computing. The Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate is a widely used method for implementing controlled interactions in multipartite systems. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the environment, quantum states undergo non-unitary evolution, leading to significant deviations from ideal dynamics. Common techniques such as Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) and Bell State Tomography (BST) are typically employed to evaluate MS gate performance and to characterize noise in the system. In this letter, we propose leveraging the geometric phase as a tool for performance assessment and noise identification in the MS gate. Our findings indicate that the geometric phase is particularly sensitive to environmental noise occurring around twice the clock pulse time. Given that geometric phase measurements do not require full-state tomography, this approach offers a practical and experimentally feasible method to detect entanglement and classify the nature of noise affecting the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyein Cho, Jeonghoon Kim, Hocheol Lim</p>
            <p>Accurate amine property prediction is essential for optimizing CO2 capture efficiency in post-combustion processes. Quantum machine learning (QML) can enhance predictive modeling by leveraging superposition, entanglement, and interference to capture complex correlations. In this study, we developed hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNN) to improve quantitative structure-property relationship modeling for CO2-capturing amines. By integrating variational quantum regressors with classical multi-layer perceptrons and graph neural networks, quantum advantages were explored in physicochemical property prediction under noiseless conditions and robustness was evaluated against quantum hardware noise using IBM quantum systems. Our results showed that HQNNs improve predictive accuracy for key solvent properties, including basicity, viscosity, boiling point, melting point, and vapor pressure. The fine-tuned and frozen pre-trained HQNN models with 9 qubits consistently achieved the highest rankings, highlighting the benefits of integrating quantum layers with pre-trained classical models. Furthermore, simulations under hardware noise confirmed the robustness of HQNNs, maintaining predictive performance. Overall, these findings emphasize the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in molecular modeling. As quantum hardware and QML algorithms continue to advance, practical quantum benefits in QSPR modeling and materials discovery are expected to become increasingly attainable, driven by improvements in quantum circuit design, noise mitigation, and scalable architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas A. Hahn, Ryan White, Hannes Bernien, Rotem Arnon-Friedman</p>
            <p>The goal of an entanglement distillation protocol is to convert large quantities of noisy entangled states into a smaller number of high-fidelity Bell pairs. The celebrated one-way hashing method is one such protocol, and it is known for being able to efficiently and deterministically distill entanglement in the asymptotic limit, i.e., when the size of the quantum system is very large. In this work, we consider setups with finite resources, e.g., a small fixed number of atoms in an atom array, and derive lower bounds on the distillation rate for the one-way hashing method. We provide analytical as well as numerical bounds on its entanglement distillation rate -- both significantly tighter than previously known bounds. We then show how the one-way hashing method can be efficiently implemented with neutral atom arrays. The combination of our theoretical results and the experimental blueprint we provide indicate that a full coherent implementation of the one-way hashing method is within reach with state-of-the-art quantum technology.</p>

            <p>H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We show that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and we find that it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory for coupling strength below a critical value. The model is found to break down for coupling strength above the critical value where the lowest Bogoliubov frequency vanishes. We show that the addition of an anharmonic elastic term is sufficient to stabilize the system in this strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Torino device for qubits and AQT device for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.</p>

            <p>Levitated systems have great potential in quantum sensing and exploring quantum effects at the macroscopic scale. Of particular interest are recent works suggesting that a levitated ferromagnet can beat the standard quantum limit of magnetometry. This work offers a theoretical model to analyze and understand critical features of the precessing dynamics of a levitated ferromagnetic needle, indeed much like a macrospin, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. The dynamics from the atomic scale reveals how the standard quantum limit is surpassed, thus verifying sensing advantages when compared with a collection of independent spins. Our theory further takes us to two additional experimental designs of immediate interest: measurement of the celebrated Berry phase with a precessing ferromagnetic needle and the use of its nutation motion to sense a low-frequency oscillating magnetic field. With a microscopic theory established for levitated ferromagnetic needles, future studies of macroscopic quantum effects and the associated quantum-classical transition also become possible.</p>

In this paper, we realized that the $s$-order incompatibility of measurements by Xu (inspired by De Bièvre's "complete incompatibility" ), can be equivalently characterized by spark of the associated measurement matrix. This provides a new linear algebraic perspective on measurement incompatibility. Leveraging this insight, we extend $s$-order incompatibility to rank-one POVMs and establish novel uncertainty relations. Furthermore, we explore the incompatibility of multiple bases and its connection to support uncertainty relations. These results may have applications in quantum cryptography, quantum state reconstruction, and quantum compressed sensing.</p>

            <p>Quantum operator scrambling describes the spreading of local operators into the whole system in the picture of Heisenberg evolution, which is often quantified by the operator size growth. Here we propose a measure of quantum operator scrambling via Holevo information of operators, by taking its capacity to distinguish operator information locally. We show that the operator size is closely related to a special kind of Holevo information of operators. Moreover, we propose a feasible protocol for measuring Holevo information of operators on digital quantum simulators based on random states. Our numerical simulations show that the integrable system can be told apart from the chaotic system by measuring the spatial-temporal patterns of Holevo information. Furthermore, we find that error mitigation is required to restore the time-oscillation behavior of Holevo information for the integrable system, a crucial feature distinct from the chaotic one. Our work provides a new perspective to understand the information scrambling and quantum chaos from aspects of Holevo information of operators.</p>

            <p>The realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes have drawn significant attention for their crucial role in enabling topological quantum computation. Conventional approaches to the braiding of Majorana zero modes rely on adiabatic processes. In this work, using a composite 2-Kitaev-chain system accommodating Majorana zero modes as a working example, we propose a nonadiabatic and non-Abelian geometry phase-based protocol to execute operations on these Majorana zero modes. This is possible by locally coupling the edge sites of both quantum chains with an embedded lattice defect, successfully simulating the braiding operation of two Majorana modes in a highly nonadiabatic fashion. To further enhance the robustness against control imperfections, we apply a multiple-pulse composite strategy to our quantum chain setting for second-order protection of the braiding operations. Our proposal can also support the fast and robust realization of the {\pi}/8 gate, an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. This work hence offers a potential pathway towards the nonadiabatic and fault-tolerant control of Majorana zero modes.</p>

We ask whether these processes can be simulated using only a natural subset of resources, namely projective measurements on the system and quantum processing of the post-measurement states. We show that the simulability of instruments can be connected to an entanglement classification problem. This leads to a computationally efficient necessary condition for simulation of generic instruments and to a complete characterisation for qubits. We use this to address relevant quantum information tasks, namely (i) the noise-tolerance of standard qubit unsharp measurements, (ii) non-projective advantages in information-disturbance trade-offs, and (iii) increased sequential Bell inequality violations under projective measurements. Moreover, we consider also $d$-dimensional Lüders instruments that correspond to weak versions of standard basis measurements and show that for large $d$ these can permit scalable noise-advantages over projective implementations.</p>

            <p>Partially coherent quantum-entangled beams combine quantum entanglement with partial coherence, allowing them to maintain quantum characteristics while being more resistant to distortions caused by random media during propagation. In this study, we investigate the effect of coherence variation of such beams on non-local double-slit quantum interference. The spatial coherence variation is achieved by controlling the spot size and transverse coherence length of the Gaussian Schell model pump in the spontaneous parametric down conversion process. For a fixed beam size, the momentum correlation width of partially coherent biphotons increases with the decreases in the transverse coherence length. This results in a biphoton beam exhibiting multiple spatial modes, making it more suitable for studying the non-local features of quantum states in imaging, interference, and diffraction experiments. Our findings infer both high-quality and near-unity visibility of nonlocal interference using the partially coherent twin beams, even with the substantial decrease in the coherence of the pump. We believe these results can enhance robustness against the deleterious effects of the medium during propagation and can have potential applications in optical image cryptography, biomedical imaging, quantum lithography, and quantum holography.</p>

We demonstrate controllable coupling between a quantum dot and an optical mode in a dielectric waveguide using a nano-opto-electro-mechanical phase shifter and a photonic crystal mirror. By controlling the phase, we induce a virtual displacement of the mirror that modifies the local density of states at the position of the emitter, thereby enhancing or suppressing spontaneous emission without an optical cavity. We observe a broadband tuning of the spontaneous emission rate and a modulation of the intensity emitted by the quantum dot in the waveguide. The method reported here could be employed to optimize the emitter-field interaction between quantum dots in-operando, by maximizing a single-photon source generation rate or adjusting its lifetime, as well as a characterization tool for the direct measurement of emitter-photon cooperativity.</p>

            <p>Quantum memory plays a pivotal role in the construction of quantum repeaters, which are essential devices for establishing long-distance quantum communications and large-scale quantum networks. To boost information capacity and signal processing speed, the implementation of high-efficiency multiplexed quantum memories is essential for the development of multiplexed quantum repeaters. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient multiplexed quantum memory by consolidating photons carrying high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) state from 4 individual channels into an elongated cold $^{87}$Rb atomic ensemble. Benefiting from the cold atomic ensemble with high optical depth, we obtain a storage efficiency exceeding 70% for the 4-channel multiplexed beam. The storage fidelities surpass 83% when all channels are operated in a 4-dimensional Hilbert space, which is far above the classical benchmark and validates the quantum functionality of our memory system. The achieved high-efficiency OAM multiplexed quantum memory opens up an avenue for efficient quantum information processing over multiple parallel channels, promising significant advances in the field of quantum communication and networking.</p>

            <p>Quantum communication at microwave frequencies has been fundamentally constrained by the susceptibility of microwave photons to thermal noise, hindering their application in scalable quantum networks. Here we demonstrate a thermal-noise-resilient microwave quantum network that establishes coherent coupling between two superconducting qubits through a 4 K thermalized niobium-titanium transmission line. By overcoupling the communication channel to a cold load at 10 mK, we suppress the effective thermal occupancy of the channel to 0.06 photons through radiative cooling -- a two-order-of-magnitude reduction below ambient thermal noise. We then decouple the cold load and rapidly transfer microwave quantum states through the channel while it rethermalizes, achieving a 58.5% state transfer fidelity and a 52.3% Bell entanglement fidelity, both exceeding the classical communication threshold. Our architecture overcomes the temperature-compatibility barrier for microwave quantum systems, providing a scalable framework for distributed quantum computing and enabling hybrid quantum networks with higher-temperature semiconductor or photonic platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum memories based on emitters with optically addressable spins rely on efficient photonic interfaces, often implemented as nanophotonic cavities with ideally narrow spectral linewidths and small mode volumes. However, these approaches require nearly perfect spectral and spatial overlap between the cavity mode and quantum emitter, which can be challenging. This is especially true in the case of solid-state quantum emitters that are often randomly positioned and can suffer from significant inhomogeneous broadening. An alternative approach to mitigate these challenges is to use slow-light waveguides that can enhance light-matter interaction across large optical bandwidths and large areas. Here, we demonstrate diamond slow light photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides that enable broadband optical coupling to embedded silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers. We take advantage of the recently demonstrated thin-film diamond photonic platform to fabricate fully suspended two-dimensional PhC waveguides. Using this approach, we demonstrate waveguide modes with high group indices up to 70 and observe Purcell-enhanced emissions of the SiVs coupled to the waveguide mode.

            <p>We examine the impact of imperfect measurement on magic state distillation (MSD) process by employing the framework of stabilizer reduction, which characterizes MSD protocols using stabilizer codes. We show the existence of thresholds for measurement strength in MSD protocols, below which there doesn't exist non-trivial target states and no input states can be distilled into better states. We prove that for MSD protocols based on CSS codes with transversal non-Clifford gates, the first-order effect of imperfect measurement will at most cause biased Pauli noise on the target states. Furthermore, we prove that we can minimize the effect of imperfect measurement noise on the asymptotically distilled states by measuring stabilizer generators in the standard form. We numerically demonstrate our theoretical results by simulating the $[[15, 1, 3]]$ and $[[14, 2, 2]]$ MSD protocols using the mapping from MSD protocols to dynamical systems. Our numerical results imply that the existence of imperfect measurement degrades the order of convergence rate to linear, regardless of the original order in the noiseless case. Our work will therefore contribute to understanding fault-tolerant quantum computing under imperfect measurement noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingfei Li</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the effects of noise on the diagnostics of quantum chaos, focusing on three primary tools: the spectral form factor (SFF), Krylov complexity, and out-of-time correlators (OTOCs). Utilizing a closed quantum system model with white noise, we demonstrate that increasing noise strength leads to an exponential suppression of these diagnostic measures. Specifically, our findings reveal that in the strong noise limit, the SFF, two-point correlation function, and OTOCs become ineffective in distinguishing chaotic behavior. The SFF is particularly impacted, exhibiting a significant decay that obscures its ability to identify quantum chaos. This study highlights the challenges posed by environmental noise in accurately diagnosing quantum chaotic systems and suggests that traditional methods may require adaptation to remain effective in realistic open quantum systems. Our results underscore the need for further research into robust diagnostic techniques that can account for noise-induced effects in quantum chaotic systems.</p>

            <p>The Meissner effect, a signature feature of superconductors, involves circular surface currents that cancel an external field. In this study, we present our findings on Meissner-like currents of photons in highly tunable light-matter interaction systems. In a quantum Rabi zigzag chain exposed to a staggered magnetic field, we identify a Meissner superradiant phase, manifesting persistent chiral edge currents in the ground state. Counter-flowing edge currents arise in each species of cavities,leading to complete cancellation of net currents throughout the entire chain. This phenomenon is analogous to surface currents in the Meissner effect. The Meissner phase is signaled by the unusual scaling exponents of the lowest excitation energy, which exhibit anomalous criticality with and without geometric frustration in each species. Intriguingly, adjusting the staggered flux induces transitions from the Meissner phase to either the even-chiral or odd-chiral superradiant phases, where the chiral edge currents flow exclusively in even or odd cavities, respectively. Additionally, by enhancing interspecies interactions, chiral currents vanish in a ferromagnetic superradiant phase. Our realization of Meissner-like currents of photons opens avenues for exploring edge state interferometry and quantum Hall effects within light-matter coupling platforms.</p>

            <p>The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a cornerstone in the study of light-matter interactions within cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). It effectively captures the dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a single-mode resonator, serving as a foundation for understanding quantum optical phenomena in a great variety of systems. However, this model may produce inaccurate results for large coupling strengths, even in systems with high anharmonicity. Moreover, issues of gauge invariance further undermine its reliability. In this work, we introduce a renormalized QRM that incorporates the effective influence of higher atomic energy levels, providing a significantly more accurate representation of the system while still maintaining a two-level description. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we present two different examples: an atom in a double-well potential and a superconducting artificial atom (fluxonium qubit). This procedure opens new possibilities for precisely engineering and understanding cavity and circuit QED systems, which are highly sought-after, especially for quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Light-controlled strong coupling of optical cavity modes spaced by 200 THz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lavanya Taneja, David I Schuster, Jonathan Simon</p>
            <p>Cavities have driven significant advances in optical physics and quantum science, with applications ranging from lasers and spectroscopy to quantum information processing, simulation and metrology. For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-Pérot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $>$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.</p>

            <h2>Extended Haldane model -- a modern gateway to topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Nag, Saptarshi Mandal</p>
            <p>The seminal Haldane model brings up a paradigm beyond the quantum Hall effect to look for a plethora of topological phases in the honeycomb and other lattices. Here we dwell into this model considering a full parameter space in the presence of spin-orbit interaction as well as Zeeman field such that the flavour of Kane-Mele model is invoked. Adopting this extended Haldane model as an example, we elucidate, in a transparent manner, a number of topological features in a pedagogical manner. First, we describe various first order topological insulator phases and their characterizations while explaining various anomalous quantum Hall effects and quantum spin Hall effects in the extended Haldane model. Second, we demonstrate the concepts of higher order topological insulator phases along with the topological invariants in the anisotropic limit of the extended Haldane model. At the end, we discuss various open issues involving \textcolor{black}{emergent or extended} symmetries that might lead to a broader understanding of various topological phases and the associated criteria behind their emergence.</p>

            <h2>Deconfined criticality as intrinsically gapless topological state in one dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng Yang, Fu Xu, Da-Chuan Lu, Yi-Zhuang You, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories: absolute and relational</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ville J. Härkönen</p>
            <p>We consider quantum field theoretic many-body Green's function approach to solve the Coulomb many-body problem. The earlier beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories are absolute in nature and are based on the non-reduced Hamiltonian. Motivated by the issues following this approach we have developed a reduced Green's function theory which is relational in nature. The central differences between these approaches trace back to the relational-absolute debate, which has continued for over two thousand years since the time of Aristotle and still persists today. We highlight that these aspects of the theories are connected to several areas of modern physics, including relational quantum mechanics, quantum reference frames, superselection rules, the separation of different types of motion and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The starting point of any such exact theory must be absolute, given that the global conservation laws hold. However, for the observables to be meaningful, they must be defined with respect to the relative space. Approximations, such as the one introduced by Born and Oppenheimer, can break global symmetries and make certain parts of the absolute description well-defined. We highlight that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not necessary to explain the existence of solids, but entities such as phonons can be naturally explained within the relational theory.</p>

            <h2>Leap into the future: shortcut to dynamics for quantum mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Capuzzi, Zehra Akdeniz, Patrizia Vignolo</p>
            <p>The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just like the fast-forward button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.</p>

            <h2>Confinement-induced unatomic trimer states in mass-imbalanced systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael M. Francisco, D. S. Rosa, T. Frederico, M. T. Yamashita, G. Krein</p>
            <p>As resonantly interacting trimers of the type AAB are progressively squeezed from $D=3$ to $D=2$, unatomic states emerge. We calculated the contacts from the high momentum tail of the single particle densities. The sharp increase of the contacts serves as a signature of the transition between the Efimov and unatomic regimes, characterized by the emergence of continuous scale invariance when the system reaches a critical dimension, $D_c$. This continuous scale invariance starts to dominate the behavior of the system at the dimension $\overline{D}<D_c$, below which the trimers momentum distribution tails exhibit a power-law behavior signaling the unatomic regime. To illustrate our findings, we studied compounds of the forms $^{7}$Li$-^{23}$Na$_{2}$, $^{7}$Li$-^{87}$Rb$_{2}$ and $^{7}$Li$-^{133}$Cs$_{2}$. The increase in the mass-imbalance of the trimers reduces the interval between $D_c$ and $\overline{D}$. The emergence of unatomic states can be experimentally verified by observing the two-body contact parameter, which is a quantity directly related to the thermodynamic properties of the gas.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rémi Robin, Pierre Rouchon, Lev-Arcady Sellem</p>
            <p>We examine the time discretization of Lindblad master equations in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our study is motivated by the fact that, with unbounded Lindbladian, projecting the evolution onto a finite-dimensional subspace using a Galerkin approximation inherently introduces stiffness, leading to a Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy type condition for explicit integration schemes. We propose and establish the convergence of a family of explicit numerical schemes for time discretization adapted to infinite dimension. These schemes correspond to quantum channels and thus preserve the physical properties of quantum evolutions on the set of density operators: linearity, complete positivity and trace. Numerical experiments inspired by bosonic quantum codes illustrate the practical interest of this approach when approximating the solution of infinite dimensional problems by that of finite dimensional problems of increasing dimension.</p>

            <h2>Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin D. Woods</p>
            <p>The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan C. McGarrigle, Hector D. Ceniceros, Glenn H. Fredrickson</p>
            <p>We introduce a projected complex Langevin (CL) numerical sampling method -- a fictitious Langevin dynamics scheme that uses numerical projection to sample a constrained stationary distribution with highly oscillatory character. Despite the complex-valued degrees of freedom and associated sign-problem, the projected CL method succeeds as a natural extension of real-valued projected Langevin processes. In the new proposed method, complex-valued Lagrange multipliers are determined to enforce constraints to machine precision at each iteration. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we adapt the projected CL method to sample coherent state quantum field theories describing interacting Bose gases, which are realized in modern cold-atom experiments. We apply projected CL to two scenarios with holomorphic constraints, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, and show that projected CL reproduces the correct thermodynamic observables. We further observe improved numerical stability and accuracy at larger timesteps when compared to the previous state-of-the-art method for performing constrained CL sampling.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</p>

            <p>We discuss efficient methods to optimize the metrological performance over local Hamiltonians in a bipartite quantum system. For a given quantum state, our methods find the best local Hamiltonian for which the state outperforms separable states the most from the point of view of quantum metrology. We show that this problem can be reduced to maximize the quantum Fisher information over a certain set of Hamiltonians. We present the quantum Fisher information in a bilinear form and maximize it by an iterative see-saw (ISS) method, in which each step is based on semidefinite programming. We also solve the problem with the method of moments that works very well for smaller systems. We consider a number of other problems in quantum information theory that can be solved in a similar manner. For instance, we determine the bound entangled quantum states that maximally violate the Computable Cross Norm-Realignment (CCNR) criterion. Our approach is one of the efficient methods that can be applied for an optimization of the unitary dynamics in quantum metrology, the other methods being, for example, machine learning, variational quantum circuits, or neural networks. The advantage of our method is the fast and robust convergence due to the simple mathematical structure of the approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liubov A. Markovich, Attaallah Almasi, Sina Zeytinoğlu, Johannes Borregaard</p>
            <p>The estimation of many-qubit observables is an essential task of quantum information processing. The generally applicable approach is to decompose the observables into weighted sums of multi-qubit Pauli strings, i.e., tensor products of single-qubit Pauli matrices, which can readily be measured with single qubit rotations. The accumulation of shot noise in this approach, however, severely limits the achievable variance for a finite number of measurements. We introduce a novel method, dubbed Coherent Pauli Summation (CPS) that circumvents this limitation by exploiting access to a single-qubit quantum memory in which measurement information can be stored and accumulated. Our algorithm offers a reduction in the required number of measurements for a given variance that scales linearly with the number of Pauli strings of the decomposed observable. Our work demonstrates how a single long-coherence qubit memory can assist the operation of noisy many-qubit quantum devices in a cardinal task.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Classical and Quantum Machine Learning: Knowledge Transfer From Classical to Quantum Neural Networks Using Knowledge Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Junayed Hasan, M.R.C.Mahdy</p>
            <p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs), harnessing superposition and entanglement, have shown potential to surpass classical methods in complex learning tasks but remain limited by hardware constraints and noisy conditions. In this work, we present a novel framework for transferring knowledge from classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to QNNs via knowledge distillation, thereby reducing the need for resource intensive quantum training and error mitigation. We conduct extensive experiments using two parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with 4 and 8 qubits on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. The approach demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements attributed to distilled knowledge from larger classical networks. Through ablation studies, we systematically compare the effect of state of the art dimensionality reduction techniques fully connected layers, center cropping, principal component analysis, and pooling to compress high-dimensional image data prior to quantum encoding. Our findings reveal that fully connected layers retain the most salient features for QNN inference, thereby surpassing other down sampling approaches. Additionally, we examine state of the art data encoding methods (amplitude, angle, and qubit encoding) and identify amplitude encoding as the optimal strategy, yielding superior accuracy across all tested datasets and qubit configurations. Through computational analyses, we show that our distilled 4-qubit and 8-qubit QNNs achieve competitive performance while utilizing significantly fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. Our results establish a promising paradigm for bridging classical deep learning and emerging quantum computing, paving the way for more powerful, resource conscious models in quantum machine intelligence.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with >99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Matter-wave interferometry is susceptible to non-inertial noise sources, which can induce dephasing and a resulting loss of interferometric visibility. Here, we focus on inertial torsion noise (ITN), which arises from the rotational motion of the experimental apparatus suspended by a thin wire and subject to random external torques. We provide analytical expressions for the ITN noise starting from generalized Langevin equations describing the experimental box which can then be used together with the transfer function to obtain the dephasing factor. We verify the theoretical modelling and the validity of the approximations using Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining good agreement between theory and numerics. As an application, we estimate the size of the effects for the next generation of interferometry experiments with femtogram particles, which could be used as the building block for entanglement-based tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We find that the ambient gas is a weak source of ITN, posing mild restrictions on the ambient pressure and temperature. We discuss the general ITN constraints by assuming a Langevin equation parameterized by three phenomenological parameters.</p>

            <h2>Conservation Laws For Every Quantum Measurement Outcome</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Collins, Sandu Popescu</p>
            <p>In the paradigmatic example of quantum measurements, whenever one measures a system which starts in a superposition of two states of a conserved quantity, it jumps to one of the two states, implying different final values for the quantity that should have been conserved. The standard law of conservation for quantum mechanics handles this jump by stating only that the total distribution of the conserved quantity over repeated measurements is unchanged, but states nothing about individual cases. Here however we show that one can go beyond this and have conservation in each individual instance. We made our arguments in the case of angular momentum of a particle on a circle, where many technicalities simplify, and bring arguments to show that this holds in full generality. Hence we argue that the conservation law in quantum mechanics should be rewritten, to go beyond its hitherto statistical formulation, to state that the total of a conserved quantity is unchanged in every individual measurement outcome. As a further crucial element, we show that conservation can be localised at the level of the system of interest and its relevant frame of reference, and is independent on any assumptions on the distribution of the conserved quantity over the entire universe.</p>

            <p>Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</p>

            <p>We present a robust shadow estimation protocol for wide classes of low-depth measurement circuits that mitigates noise as long as the effective measurement map including noise is locally unitarily invariant. This is in practice an excellent approximation, encompassing for instance the case of ideal single-qubit Clifford gates composing the first circuit layer of an otherwise arbitrary circuit architecture and even non-Markovian, gate-dependent noise in the rest of the circuit. We argue that for weakly-correlated local noise, the measurement channel has an efficient matrix-product representation, and show how to estimate this directly from experimental data using tensor-network tools, eliminating the need for analytical or numeric calculations. We illustrate the relevance of our method with both numerics and proof-of-principle experiments on an IBM Quantum device. Numerically, we show that unmitigated shallow shadows with noisy circuits become more biased as the depth increases. In contrast, using the same number of samples, robust ultra-shallow shadows become more precise with increasing depth for relevant parameter regimes. The gain in sample efficiency is still limited by the noise per gate, resulting in an optimal circuit depth per noise level. Experimentally, we observe improved precision in two simple fidelity estimation tasks using five-qubit circuits with up to two layers of entangling gates, by about an order of magnitude. Under the practical constraints of current and near-term noisy quantum devices, our method maximally realizes the potential of shadow estimation with global rotations and identifies its fundamental limitations in the presence of noise.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</p>

            <h2>On the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect and the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masashi Wakamatsu</p>
            <p>The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integrals of the time-dependent vector potential along paths in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Owing to the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, this closed line-integral of the vector potential can be related to the integral of the electric and magnetic fields over the 2-dimensional area, the boundary of which is given by the above-mentioned closed path. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In the present paper, we carefully reanalyze their cancellation argument by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of the time-dependent external electromagnetic potential combined with more careful treatment of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. Careful analysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem shows that the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is partially correct but their central claim that only the time-independent part of the magnetic field contributes to the AB-phase shift so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect is not justified, thereby supporting likely existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Earth-to-Satellite Quantum-Classical Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Wang, Timothy C. Ralph, Ryan Aguinaldo, Robert Malaney</p>
            <p>Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.</p>

            <h2>Interpretation of wave function by coherent ensembles of trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir V. Kisil</p>
            <p>We re-use some original ideas of de~Broglie, Schrödiger, Dirac and Feynman to revise the ensemble interpretation of wave function in quantum mechanics. To this end we introduce coherence (auto-concordance) of ensembles of quantum trajectories in the space-time. The coherence condition accounts phases proportional to classical action, which are in foundation of the Feynman path integral technique. Therefore, our interpretation is entirely based on well-known and tested concepts and methods of wave mechanics. Similarly to other ensemble interpretations our approach allows us to avoid all problems and paradoxes related to wave function collapse during a measurement process. Another consequence is that no quantum computation or quantum cryptography method will ever work if it assumes that a particular q-bit represents the entire wave function.</p>

            <h2>Binarisation of multi-outcome measurements in high-dimensional quantum correlation experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armin Tavakoli, Roope Uola, Jef Pauwels</p>
            <p>High-dimensional systems are an important frontier for photonic quantum correlation experiments. These correlation tests commonly prescribe measurements with many possible outcomes but they are often implemented through many individual binary-outcome measurements that use only a single-detector. Here, we discuss how this binarisation procedure for multi-outcome measurements can open a loophole, unless specific device-characterisation assumptions are satisfied. We highlight that correlation tests designed for multi-outcome measurements can be trivialised in binarised implementations and we then show how to accurately analyse binarised data to reveal its quantum features. For seminal types of correlation experiments, such as Bell inequality tests, steering tests and prepare-and-measure experiments, we find that binarisation may incur a sizable cost in the magnitude of quantum advantages. This emphasizes the importance of both accurate data analysis and implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements in high-dimensional correlation experiments.</p>

            <p>We present a scheme for speeding up quantum measurement. The scheme builds on previous protocols that entangle the system to be measured with ancillary systems. In the idealised situation of perfect entangling operations and no decoherence, it gives an exact space-time trade-off meaning the readout speed increases linearly with the number of ancilla. We verify this scheme is robust against experimental imperfections through numerical modelling of gate noise and readout errors, and under certain circumstances our scheme can even lead to better than linear improvement in the speed of measurement with the number of systems measured. This hardware-agnostic approach is broadly applicable to a range of quantum technology platforms and offers a route to accelerate mid-circuit measurement as required for effective quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>The advent of quantum computers has justified the development of quantum machine learning algorithms , based on the adaptation of the principles of machine learning to the formalism of qubits. Among such quantum algorithms, anomaly detection represents an important problem crossing several disciplines from cybersecurity, to fraud detection to particle physics. We summarize the key concepts involved in quantum computing, introducing the formal concept of quantum speed up. The review provides a structured map of anomaly detection based on quantum machine learning. We have grouped existing algorithms according to the different learning methods, namely quantum supervised, quantum unsupervised and quantum reinforcement learning, respectively. We provide an estimate of the hardware resources to provide sufficient computational power in the future. The review provides a systematic and compact understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. We eventually provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the learning methods in real application domains.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Henrik Wilming</p>
            <p>Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</p>

            <h2>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</h2>

            <p>The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. Presented interferometry promises direct applications in Doppler-free atomic and molecular spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhdin Abdo Wodedo, Tesfay Gebremariam Tesfahannes, Tewodros Yirgashewa Darge, Berihu Teklu</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme that optimizes entanglement in nanomechanical resonators through quantum state transfer of squeezed fields assisted by radiation pressure. The system is driven by red-detuned laser fields, which enable simultaneous cooling of the mechanical resonators while facilitating the transfer of quantum states in a weak coupling, sideband-resolved regime. The mechanical entanglement is quantified using logarithmic negativity within the bipartite Gaussian states of the two mechanical modes. Our results show that the degree of mechanical entanglement is strongly influenced by several key parameters, including the parametric phase and nonlinear gain of the non-degenerate OPA, the squeezing strength of the injected squeezed vacuum reservoir, optomechanical cooperativity (controlled by laser drive power), and the mechanical bath temperature (phonon thermal excitation). Additionally, our results indicate that careful tuning of these parameters can enhance entanglement robustness, suggesting that this optomechanical scheme holds promise for applications in quantum sensing and information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benoît Dubus (Université libre de Bruxelles), Joseph Cunningham (Université libre de Bruxelles), Jérémie Roland (Université libre de Bruxelles)</p>
            <p>Many quantum algorithms, such as adiabatic algorithms (e.g. AQC) and phase randomisation, require simulating Hamiltonian evolution. In addition, the simulation of physical systems is an important objective in its own right. In many cases, the Hamiltonian is complex at first sight, but can be decomposed as a linear combination of simple ones; for instance, a sum of local Hamiltonians for Ising models or a sum of time-independent Hamiltonians with time-dependent coefficients (which is typically the case for adiabatic algorithms). In this paper we develop a new compiler, similar to the first order randomized Trotter, or qDRIFT, but with an arguably simpler framework. It is more versatile as it supports a large class of randomisation schemes and as well as time-dependent weights. We first present the model and derive its governing equations. We then define and analyze the simulation error for a sum of two Hamiltonians, and generalize it to a sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians. We prove that the number of gates necessary to simulate the weighted sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians of magnitude $C$ during a time $T$ with an error less than $\epsilon_0$ grows as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(C^2T^2\epsilon_0^{-1}\right)$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeniy O. Kiktenko, Andrey Tayduganov, Aleksey K. Fedorov</p>
            <p>We develop a novel key routing algorithm for quantum key distribution (QKD) networks that utilizes a distribution of keys between remote, i.e., not directly connected by a QKD link, nodes through multiple non-overlapping paths. This approach enchases the security of QKD network by minimizing potential vulnerabilities associated with individual trusted nodes. The algorithm ensures a balanced allocation of the workload across the QKD network links, while aiming for the target key generation rate between directly connected and remote nodes. We present the results of testing the algorithm on two QKD network models consisting of 6 and 10 nodes. The testing demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to distribute secure keys among the nodes of the network in an all-to-all manner, ensuring that the information-theoretic security of the keys between remote nodes is maintained even when one of the trusted nodes is compromised. These results highlight the potential of the algorithm to improve the performance of QKD networks.</p>

            <h2>A Classical Analogue of Entanglement for a Kicked Top</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bilal Khalid, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>It is widely believed that quantum mechanics cannot exhibit chaos, since unitarity of time evolution ensures that distances between quantum states are preserved. However, a parallel argument can be constructed in classical mechanics that would seem to deny the existence of classical chaos too. The argument works by describing classical states as probability distributions in phase space and showing that the inner product between distributions on phase space is preserved under Liouvillian dynamics. Thus, the more faithful classical analogy of a quantum state is not a single phase space trajectory but is instead a phase space distribution, and chaos in such states must be identified by some statistical signatures instead of exponential separation of nearby states. The search for these signatures is the primary goal in quantum chaos research. However, this perspective also naturally motivates the search for classical analogues of these signatures, to reveal the inner machinery of chaos in quantum systems. One widely recognized signature of chaos in quantum systems is the dynamical generation of entanglement. Chaos in the classical system is correlated with a greater entanglement production in the corresponding quantum system. One of the most well-studied examples of this is the kicked top model. In this paper, we construct a classical analogue of bipartite entanglement in terms of the mutual information between phase space distributions of subsystems and find completely analogous signatures of chaos as those found in entanglement for the kicked top Hamiltonian.</p>

With specifically tailored dynamical decoupling sequences, it is possible to execute selective, high-fidelity two-body gates between the electron spin of the NV center and a targeted nuclear spin. In this work, we present a method to determine the optimal execution time that balances the trade-off between fidelity and execution speed for gates generated by adaptive XY sequences. With these optimized gates, we use the nuclear spin environment as a code space for quantum error correction within a color center register.</p>

            <p>Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</p>

            <p>Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</p>
