            <h2>Reply to Structural Vulnerability in Y00 Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geraldo A. Barbosa</p>
            <p>The paper arXiv:2412.07300v1 [quant-ph] 10 Dec 2024, entitled "Structural Vulnerability in Y00 Protocols", by Kentaro Imafuku analyzes "Secure Communication Using Mesoscopic Coherent States", Phys. Rev. Lett., 90:227901, Jun 2003, by Geraldo A. Barbosa, Eric Corndorf, Prem Kumar, and Horace P. Yuen. Imafuku states that in his analyzes a structural vulnerability was revealed that enables the leakage of secret information from the measurement results in the Y00 protocol. Furthermore, it is also stated that an even simpler model, but based on the same original principles, can be more efficient than the original Y00 protocol. This reply shows that: 1) the alleged vulnerability is due to a misinterpretation of one result by Imafuku and 2) that the simple model proposed by him is more vulnerable than the original Y00.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Enhanced Conformal Methods for Multi-Output Uncertainty: A Holistic Exploration and Experimental Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emre Tasar</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a unified approach to harness quantum conformal methods for multi-output distributions, with a particular emphasis on two experimental paradigms: (i) a standard 2-qubit circuit scenario producing a four-dimensional outcome distribution, and (ii) a multi-basis measurement setting that concatenates measurement probabilities in different bases (Z, X, Y) into a twelve-dimensional output space. By combining a multioutput regression model (e.g., random forests) with distributional conformal prediction, we validate coverage and interval-set sizes on both simulated quantum data and multi-basis measurement data. Our results confirm that classical conformal prediction can effectively provide coverage guarantees even when the target probabilities derive from inherently quantum processes. Such synergy opens the door to next-generation quantum-classical hybrid frameworks, providing both improved interpretability and rigorous coverage for quantum machine learning tasks.

            <h2>Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Morandi, Sara Nicoletti, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani</p>
            <p>We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</p>

            <h2>Perfect, Pretty Good and Optimized Quantum State Transfer in Transmon qubit chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Serra, Alejandro Ferr√≥n, Omar Osenda</p>
            <p>Chains of transmon qubits are considered promising systems to implement different quantum information tasks. In particular as channels that perform high-quality quantum state transfer. We study how changing the interaction strength between the chain qubits allows us to obtain perfect or pretty good state transfer and present explicit analytic expressions for their transmission fidelity. For particular values of the interactions between the qubits, transmon chains are equivalent to generalized SSH chains and show the traditional traits observed in chains with topological states, localized states at the extremes of the chain, and eigenvalues that lie inside the spectral gap. Consequently, we study the quantum state transfer on chains with dimerized interactions, looking for chains with fast transfer times. We show that, in many cases, asking for fast transfer times results in chains with dimerized interactions that do not have topological states.</p>

            <p>Quantum networking and computing technologies demand scalable hardware with high-speed control for large systems of quantum devices. Solid-state platforms have emerged as promising candidates, offering scalable fabrication for a wide range of qubits. Architectures based on spin-photon interfaces allow for highly-connected quantum networks over photonic links, enabling entanglement distribution for quantum networking and distributed quantum computing protocols. With the potential to address these demands, optically-active spin defects in silicon are one proposed platform for building quantum technologies. Here, we electrically excite the silicon T centre in integrated optoelectronic devices that combine nanophotonic waveguides and cavities with p-i-n diodes. We observe single-photon electroluminescence from a cavity-coupled T centre with $g^{(2)}(0)=0.05(2)$. Further, we use the electrically-triggered emission to herald the electron spin state, initializing it with $92(8)\%$ fidelity. This shows, for the first time, electrically-injected single-photon emission from a silicon colour centre and a new method of electrically-triggered spin initialization. These findings present a new telecommunications band light source for silicon and a highly parallel control method for T centre quantum processors, advancing the T centre as a versatile defect for scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Selective Excitation of Superconducting Qubits with a Shared Control Line through Pulse Shaping</h2>

            <p>In conventional architectures of superconducting quantum computers, each qubit is connected to its own control line, leading to a commensurate increase in the number of microwave lines as the system scales. Frequency-multiplexed qubit-control addresses this problem by enabling multiple qubits to share a single microwave line. However, it can cause unwanted excitation of non-target qubits, especially when the detuning between qubits is smaller than the pulse bandwidth. Here, we propose a selective-excitation-pulse (SEP) technique that suppresses unwanted excitations by shaping a drive pulse to create null points at non-target qubit frequencies. In a proof-of-concept experiment with three fixed-frequency transmon qubits, we demonstrate that the SEP technique achieves single-qubit gate fidelities comparable to those obtained with conventional Gaussian pulses while effectively suppressing unwanted excitations in non-target qubits. These results highlight the SEP technique as a promising tool for enhancing frequency-multiplexed qubit-control.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Quantum Steering with Limited Resources: A Semi-supervised Machine Learning Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yansa Lu, Zhihua Chen, Zhihao Ma, Shao-Ming Fei</p>
            <p>Quantum steering, an intermediate quantum correlation lying between entanglement and nonlocality, has emerged as a critical quantum resource for a variety of quantum information processing tasks such as quantum key distribution and true randomness generation. The ability to detect and quantify quantum steering is crucial for these applications. Semi-definite programming (SDP) has proven to be a valuable tool to quantify quantum steering. However, the challenge lies in the fact that the optimal measurement strategy is not priori known, making it time-consuming to compute the steerable measure for any given quantum state. Furthermore, the utilization of SDP requires full information of the quantum state, necessitating quantum state tomography, which can be complex and resource-consuming. In this work, we utilize the semi-supervised self-training model to estimate the steerable weight, a pivotal measure of quantum steering. The model can be trained using a limited amount of labeled data, thus reducing the time for labeling. The features are constructed by the probabilities derived by performing three sets of projective measurements under arbitrary local unitary transformations on the target states, circumventing the need for quantum tomography. The model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities and can achieve high levels of precision with limited resources.</p>

            <h2>Quantum error mitigation in optimized circuits for particle-density correlations in real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domenico Pomarico, Mahul Pandey, Riccardo Cioli, Federico Dell'Anna, Saverio Pascazio, Francesco V. Pepe, Paolo Facchi, Elisa Ercolessi</p>
            <p>Quantum computing gives direct access to the study of real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In principle, it is possible to directly calculate non-equal-time correlation functions, from which one can detect interesting phenomena, such as the presence of quantum scars or dynamical quantum phase transitions. In practice, these calculations are strongly affected by noise, due to the complexity of the required quantum circuits. As a testbed for the evaluation of real-time evolution of observables and correlations, the dynamics of the Zn Schwinger model in a one dimensional lattice is considered. To control the computational cost, we adopt a quantum-classical strategy that reduces the dimensionality of the system by restricting the dynamics to the Dirac vacuum sector and optimizes the embedding into a qubit model by minimizing the number of three-qubit gates. We derive a digital circuit implementation of the time-evolution of particle-density correlation operators and their correlation, comparing results from exact evolution, bare noisy simulations and simulations with different error mitigation techniques. For the evolution of the particle-density operators we also perform runs on a physical IBM quantum device.</p>

            <h2>Phase-sensitive Rydberg-atom interferometry with Floquet electromagnetically induced transparency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingying Han, Changfa He, Peng Xu, Yanting Zhao, Tao Wang, Weidong Li</p>
            <p>We design a phase-sensitive Rydberg-atom interferometry by implementing Floquet electromagnetically induced transparency (FEIT). The FEIT mixes the sidebands of a Rydberg state induced by a MHz radio frequency (RF) field and recombines them into FEIT bands. The FEIT bands act as screens to present the interference between paths with different phases, which are transitions between the sidebands and excited states. This interferometry can measure the phase of a MHz RF field without a local RF reference field. A phase reference is supplied to the atoms via a periodic electrical signal in the FEIT. We demonstrate that the MHz RF phase is measured over a full range of $2\pi$, and $10^{-4}$ rad accuracy is achieved. Moreover, the RF amplitude can also be measured with higher accuracy than the traditional EIT-based scheme.</p>

            <h2>Preserving and Preparing Coherent States in V-type Atom in Dissipative Cavity under Detuning and Weak Measurement Reversal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiying Pan, Fuhua Li, Hong-Mei Zou, Zijin Liang</p>
            <p>In this work, the quantum coherence of a V-type atom in a dissipative cavity under detuning and weak measurement reversal is studied using methods such as the Fano theorem, the Schrodinger equation and the l1 norm of coherence. The atomic density operator is derived, and the coherences of different initial states are investigated in detail under parameters including spontaneously generated interference (SGI), atom-reservoir coupling, weak measurement reversal and detuning between the atom and the cavity. The results indicate that, the strong coupling can induce coherence sudden death (CSD) and coherence sudden birth (CSB), and the non-zero SGI parameter only induces CSB but the detuning may avoid CSD and CSB. Moreover, both detuning and weak measurement reversal have positive effects on protecting and generating quantum coherence, but the weak measurement has a negative effect. The non-zero SGI parameter has positive effects on declining and generating of quantum coherence. In particular, the maximal coherent state can be very effectively protected and the coherent state can be prepared if all parameters are selected appropriately. Physical interpretations are also provided for these results.</p>

            <h2>Disentanglement--induced bistability in a magnetic resonator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eyal Buks</p>
            <p>Multi--stability in the response of a ferrimagnetic spin resonator to an externally applied driving is experimentally studied. The observed multi--stability cannot be derived from any master equation that linearly depends on the spins' reduced density operator. Traditionally, the nonlinearity that is required in order to theoretically account for the observed multi--stability is introduced by implementing the method of Bosonization. Here, an alternative explanation, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems is explored. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a master equation having an added nonlinear term, which deterministically generates disentanglement. Experimental results are compared with predictions derived from both competing theoretical models. It is found that better agreement with data is obtained from the disentanglement--based model. This finding, together with a difficulty to justify the Bosonization--based model, indirectly support the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis.</p>

            <h2>Generation of optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements in cascaded optomagnomechanical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chong Zhang, Xiaomin Liu, Liwen Gao, Rongguo Yang, Jing Zhang, Tiancai Zhang</p>
            <p>The optomagnomechanical system, which involves flexible nonlinearities, is one of the promising physical platforms for studying the preparation and manipulation of quantum entanglements, as well as the construction of hybrid quantum networks. A scheme for entanglement enhancement and quadripartite entanglement generation is proposed, based on a cascaded optomagnomechanical system. On the one hand, optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements within the two subsystems are investigated, and their parameter dependence, such as detuning, decay, coupling strength, and transmission efficiency, is discussed. On the other hand, the parameter conditions for achieving optimal optomicrowave and optomagnonic quadripartite entanglements are also obtained. The results show that significant enhancement of optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements in the second cavity can be obtained in a certain range of parameters. Under optimized parameter conditions, optomicrowave and optomagnonic quadripartite entanglements can be generated throughout the entire cascaded system. This research provides a theoretical basis for the manipulation of quantum entanglement, the transmission of the magnon's state, and the construction of hybrid quantum networks involving different physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Zeno blockade in optomechanical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Pelka, Andr√© Xuereb</p>
            <p>We investigate the application of the quantum Zeno effect (QZE) for the preparation of non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems. By frequently monitoring the system, the QZE can suppress transitions away from desired subspaces of states. We show that this enables the preparation of states in qubit subspaces even in the presence of noise and decoherence. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate that QZE-based protocols can significantly improve the robustness of state preparation of qubit states in continuous variable architectures. Our results extend the utility of the QZE beyond discrete systems, highlighting its potential for enhancing quantum control in more complex quantum information processing environments. These findings offer a promising approach for achieving reliable non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems, with implications for the development of photonic quantum computing and quantum sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Ernesto Quintela Rodriguez, Piero Lafiosca, Tommaso Giovannini, Chiara Cappelli</p>
            <p>Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. Exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Following the emergence of quantum computing, the subsequent quantum revolution will be that of interconnecting individual quantum computers at global level. In the same way that classical computers only realised their full potential with the emergence of the internet, a fully realised quantum internet is the net stage of evolution for quantum computation. This work examines in detail how the quantum internet would evolve in practice, focusing not only on the technology itself but also on the implications it will have economically and politically. We present both original ideas, as well as an extensive review of relevant and related background material. This work begins with a description of classical networks before introducing the key concepts behind quantum networks, such as quantum internet protocols, quantum cryptography, and cloud quantum computing. The work is divided into technical sections (requiring only a basic knowledge of the notation of quantum mechanics), for those interested in mathematical details, as well as non-technical sections for those seeking a more general understanding. We target this work very broadly at quantum and classical computer scientists, classical computer systems, software and network engineers, physicists, economists, artists, musicians, and those just generally curious about the future of quantum technologies and what they might bring to humanity.</p>

            <h2>State Transfer in Latent-Symmetric Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Himmel, Max Ehrhardt, Matthias Heinrich, Sebastian Weidemann, Tom A. W. Wolterink, Malte R√∂ntgen, Peter Schmelcher, Alexander Szameit</p>
            <p>The transport of quantum states is a crucial aspect of information processing systems, facilitating operations such as quantum key distribution and inter-component communication within quantum computers. Most quantum networks rely on symmetries to achieve an efficient state transfer. A straightforward way to design such networks is to use spatial symmetries, which severely limits the design space. Our work takes a novel approach to designing photonic networks that do not exhibit any conventional spatial symmetries, yet nevertheless support an efficient transfer of quantum states. Paradoxically, while a perfect transfer efficiency is technically unattainable in these networks, a fidelity arbitrarily close to unity is always reached within a finite time of evolution. Key to this approach are so-called latent, or 'hidden', symmetries, which are embodied in the spectral properties of the network. Latent symmetries substantially expand the design space of quantum networks and hold significant potential for applications in quantum cryptography and secure state transfer. We experimentally realize such a nine-site latent-symmetric network and successfully observe state transfer between two sites with a measured fidelity of 75%. Furthermore, by launching a two-photon state, we show that quantum interference is preserved by the network. This demonstrates that the latent symmetries enable efficient quantum state transfer, while offering greater flexibility in designing quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriele Bizzarri, Linda Sansoni, Eleonora Stefanutti, Ilaria Gianani, Marco Barbieri, Katarzyna Roszak, Andrea Chiuri</p>
            <p>Decoherence is a manifestation of the coupling of a system with its environment. The resulting loss of information can hamper the functioning of quantum devices, hence the need of understanding its origin and dynamics. Decoherence can stem from entanglement, but it can also be classical in nature. Indeed, methods have been developed to understand whether qubit-environment entanglement (QEE) is actually present in some important classes of quantum channels - pure dephasing. Their practicality resides in the fact they only require accessing the system qubit. In this article we show an implementation of this technique in a photonic quantum channel simulator via a scheme that has been tailored to the system under study. By controlling the input state of the environment in our simulation, we can check the occurrence of qubit environment entanglement in simple, yet insightful test cases. Our results showcase the usefulness and experimental relevance of the QEE witnessing technique.</p>

            <h2>Practical scheme for efficient distillation of GHZ states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> √Åron Rozgonyi, G√°bor Sz√©chenyi, Orsolya K√°lm√°n, Tam√°s Kiss</p>
            <p>We develop an efficient local operation and classical communication (LOCC) scheme for the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states from tripartite systems subjected to both coherent and incoherent errors. The proposed method employs an iterative process that applies a postselection-based non-linear transformation to increase the entanglement of 3-qubit states. In contrast to traditional distillation protocols that require an exponential number of initial states as a resource, our method achieves subexponential convergence towards a pure GHZ state. The proposed scheme is practical in the sense that it employs a small set of relatively simple unitary operations and projective measurements in the computational basis. We systematically develop a double-iteration protocol by providing a mathematical framework for the transformation processes involved, emphasizing the role of unitary operations in correcting arbitrary small errors in the initial states. Through analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the protocol's ability to progressively eliminate noise and improve fidelity over subsequent iterations. Significantly, our protocol not only corrects for small arbitrary distortions in the GHZ states but also maintains operational simplicity, making it feasible for practical quantum computing applications.</p>

            <p>We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr√∂dinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Vishal Singh, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>The hockey-stick divergence is a fundamental quantity characterizing several statistical privacy frameworks that ensure privacy for classical and quantum data. In such quantum privacy frameworks, the adversary is allowed to perform all possible measurements. However, in practice, there are typically limitations to the set of measurements that can be performed. To this end, here, we comprehensively analyze the measured hockey-stick divergence under several classes of practically relevant measurement classes. We prove several of its properties, including data processing and convexity. We show that it is efficiently computable by semi-definite programming for some classes of measurements and can be analytically evaluated for Werner and isotropic states. Notably, we show that the measured hockey-stick divergence characterizes optimal privacy parameters in the quantum pufferfish privacy framework. With this connection and the developed technical tools, we enable methods to quantify and audit privacy for several practically relevant settings. Lastly, we introduce the measured hockey-stick divergence of channels and explore its applications in ensuring privacy for channels.</p>

            <p>We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Annealing for Robust Principal Component Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Tomeo (1), Panos P. Markopoulos (2), Andreas Savakis (1) ((1) Rochester Institute of Technology, (2) The University of Texas at San Antonio)</p>
            <p>Principal component analysis is commonly used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, denoising, and visualization. The most commonly used principal component analysis method is based upon optimization of the L2-norm, however, the L2-norm is known to exaggerate the contribution of errors and outliers. When optimizing over the L1-norm, the components generated are known to exhibit robustness or resistance to outliers in the data. The L1-norm components can be solved for with a binary optimization problem. Previously, L1-BF has been used to solve the binary optimization for multiple components simultaneously. In this paper we propose QAPCA, a new method for finding principal components using quantum annealing hardware which will optimize over the robust L1-norm. The conditions required for convergence of the annealing problem are discussed. The potential speedup when using quantum annealing is demonstrated through complexity analysis and experimental results. To showcase performance against classical principal component analysis techniques experiments upon synthetic Gaussian data, a fault detection scenario and breast cancer diagnostic data are studied. We find that the reconstruction error when using QAPCA is comparable to that when using L1-BF.</p>

            <h2>Realization of tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in superconducting circuit lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Youssefi, Ahmad Motavassal, Shingo Kono, Seyed Akbar Jafari, Tobias J. Kippenberg</p>
            <p>Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.</p>

            <h2>Poincare invariant interaction between two Dirac particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Barandiaran, Martin Rivas</p>
            <p>The spinning electron-electron interaction is described in classical terms by means of two possible classical interactions: The instantaneous Coulomb interaction between the charge centers of both particles and the Poincar√© invariant interaction developed in a previous work. The numerical integrations are performed with several Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested readers in the reference Section. One difference of these interactions is that the Poincar√© invariant interaction does not satisfy the action-reaction principle in the synchronous description and, therefore, there is no conservation of the mechanical linear momentum. It is the total linear momentum of the system what is conserved. In this synchronous description the interaction is not mediated by the retarded fields but is described in terms of the instantaneous positions, velocities and accelerations of the center of charge of both particles. In the Poincar√© invariant description the net binding force that holds linked two Dirac particles is stronger than in the Coulomb case, thus forming a stable spin 1 system of 2 Dirac particles. This bosonic state of spin 1 does not correspond to a Cooper pair because the separation between the centers of mass of the Dirac particles is below Compton's wavelength, smaller than the correlation distance of the Cooper pair. Since the Poincar√© invariant interaction is relativistically invariant it can be used for analyzing high energy scattering processes.</p>

            <p>We evaluate the status of the development of a responsible future quantum internet (QI). Through horizon scanning, domain expert trend analysis and guided workshops, we present a desired future (DF) conceptualized by stakeholders within the scope of the ethical, legal, societal aspects (ELSA) and policy implications (ELSPI) of the QI. We examine the alignment of the present situation and the DF of the QI ELSPI to the ideals of the 'ten principles for responsible quantum innovation' developed by [Mauritz Kop et al. 2024 Quantum Sci. Technol. 9 035013]. Most principles in the DF are well aligned to the ideal, except for the misalignment in 'intellectual property' (IP) and 'dual use', revealing the precarious balance of well intended policy suggestions and effective outcomes. Additionally, there is an overemphasis placed on the principal of societal relevance in the DF, risking overseeing other principles in the future steering of the ELSPI. The present situation is in moderate alignment with the principles, however trending to misalignment on IP and international collaboration due to QI commercialization and the push for geopolitical sovereignty. For continued success of a responsible quantum internet, we recommend further investigation on the prevention of dual use quantum internet applications, closer involvement of commercial entities in ELSPI ideation, continued recognition of base-layer technology research and stakeholder education on QI applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keiran Lewellen, Rohit Mukherjee, Haoyu Guo, Saswata Roy, Valla Fatemi, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering is a powerful method that can be used to modify the properties of interacting many-body Hamiltonians via the application of periodic time-dependent drives. Here we consider the physics of an inductively shunted superconducting Josephson junction in the presence of Floquet drives in the fluxonium regime and beyond, which we dub the frozonium artificial atom. We find that in the vicinity of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency, the many-body dynamics can be tuned to that of an effectively linear bosonic oscillator, with additional nonlinear corrections that are suppressed in higher powers of the drive frequency. By analyzing the inverse participation ratios between the time-evolved frozonium wavefunctions and the eigenbasis of a linear oscillator, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a novel dynamical control using a combination of numerical exact diagonalization and Floquet-Magnus expansion. We discuss the physics of resonances between quasi-energy states induced by the drive, and ways to mitigate their effects. We also highlight the enhanced protection of frozonium against external sources of noise present in experimental setups. This work lays the foundation for future applications in quantum memory and bosonic quantum control using superconducting circuits.</p>

            <h2>Matrix Ordering through Spectral and Nilpotent Structures in Totally Ordered Complex Number Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shih-Yu Chang</p>
            <p>Matrix inequalities play a pivotal role in mathematics, generalizing scalar inequalities and providing insights into linear operator structures. However, the widely used L√∂wner ordering, which relies on real-valued eigenvalues, is limited to Hermitian matrices, restricting its applicability to non-Hermitian systems increasingly relevant in fields like non-Hermitian physics. To overcome this, we develop a total ordering relation for complex numbers, enabling comparisons of the spectral components of general matrices with complex eigenvalues. Building on this, we introduce the Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering (SNO), a partial order for arbitrary matrices of the same dimensions. We further establish a theoretical framework for majorization ordering with complex-valued functions, which aids in refining SNO and analyzing spectral components. An additional result is the extension of the Schur--Ostrowski criterion to the complex domain. Moreover, we characterize Jordan blocks of matrix functions using a generalized dominance order for nilpotent components, facilitating systematic analysis of non-diagonalizable matrices. Finally, we derive monotonicity and convexity conditions for functions under the SNO framework, laying a new mathematical foundation for advancing matrix analysis.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a holographic ``thread game", which visually represents quantum entanglement with thread-like objects, based on some natural assumptions. By studying their trajectories in the holographic bulk, we ultimately find that these threads should correspond precisely to perfect geodesics in the bulk, making kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing the thread game. Furthermore, it turns out that the thread game has a quantum circuit interpretation, where each thread plays the role of a wire. Therefore, kinematic space can be regarded as the ``input board" of the holographic quantum circuit characterizing the entanglement structure of the spacetime. Based on this understanding, we also present a nice explanation of holographic complexity in the language of kinematic space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Na Wu, Xikun Li, Nathan Goldman, Botao Wang</p>
            <p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</p>

            <p>Ordered InAs quantum dot (QD) arrays have been obtained on pre-patterned GaAs (0 0 1) substrates by atomic force microscopy (AFM) local oxidation nanolithography. Prior to InAs molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) deposition, an ordered square array of nanoholes is formed at the GaAs pre-patterned surface following in situ etching with atomic hydrogen. A low substrate temperature is maintained during the whole process in order to avoid pattern smoothing. Our results show that the density and dimensions of the nanoholes on the GaAs surface determine InAs QD size, nucleation site and InAs dose necessary for their formation. As a function of the geometrical parameters of the nanohole array, we can obtain either ordered 2D arrays of separated QD, closely packed QD or localized areas for QD formation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Xu, Yang Shen, Yuan-Yao He, Mingpu Qin</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Cataldi</p>
            <p>This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</p>

            <h2>Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Tausendpfund, Aditi Mitra, Matteo Rizzi</p>
            <p>Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</p>

            <p>Previous attoclock experiments measuring the photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) via strong-field ionization in an elliptically polarized laser field have shown anomalously large offset angles in the nonadiabatic regime with large Keldysh parameters ($\gamma$). We investigate the process theoretically in the complete range of ellipticity ($\epsilon$) and large range of $\gamma$, employing numerical solutions of time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation and nonadiabatic classical-trajectory Monte Carlo simulations matched with the under-the-barrier motion via the nonadiabatic strong field approximation. We show the formation of low-energy structures (LES) at any ellipticity value when the Keldysh parameter is sufficiently large. Three regimes of the interaction in the ($\epsilon$-$\gamma$)-space of parameters are identified via the characteristic PMD features. The significant modification of the recollision picture in the nonadiabatic regime, with so-called anomalous and hybrid slow recollisions, is shown to be behind the LES, inducing extreme nonlinear Coulomb bunching in the phase-space in the polarization plane. Our findings elucidate subtle features of the attosecond electron dynamics in strong-field ionization at extreme conditions and indicate limitations on attosecond imaging.</p>

            <p>We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Sharma, Chenhaoyue Wang, Hsuan Ming Yu, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyun-Myung Chun, Jong-Min Park</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic constraints impose a trade-off between power and efficiency in heat engines, preventing the simultaneous achievement of high power and high efficiency. For classical microscopic engines, explicit inequalities have been discovered, demonstrating the inherent inevitability of this power-efficiency trade-off. However, extensions of these results to quantum engines have so far been limited to cases of slow operation. In this study, we derive a power-efficiency trade-off relation for a paradigmatic quantum engine operating within a finite time, specifically the Otto cycle of a quantum harmonic oscillator. By utilizing a phase-space approach based on quasi-probability representations, we establish a universal trade-off relation applicable to arbitrary time-dependent protocols during the adiabatic processes. Our results reveal that the power of the quantum engine vanishes as the efficiency approaches the quantum mechanical efficiency bound, which is stricter than the Carnot bound. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the upper bound is attained, which indicate maximum power is achieved when the generation of quantum coherence is reduced, and the difference in time durations of the isochoric processes increases. These findings are validated through numerical calculations, which confirm their applicability across various types of protocols for heat engine cycles.</p>

To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell.

We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</p>

            <p>By employing the replica trick we study the impact of the replica parameter $n$ on the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in the End of the World (EoW) model and the island model, respectively. For the EoW model, we present $n$-dependent evolution curves of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement under both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In particular, in the canonical ensemble, all quantities decrease as $n$ increases at late times. For the island model, we develop the replica geometry for finite $n$ and re-evaluate the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in a two-sided eternal Jackiw-Teitelboim black hole coupled with a thermal bath. In the case of a single island configuration, the modular entropy and capacity of entanglement closely resemble the thermal entropy and the heat capacity, respectively, yielding results analogous to those obtained in the canonical ensemble for the EoW model. The analysis of the results from these two models strongly indicates that in geometries with a greater number of $n$ copies, more connected geometries effectively purify thermal Hawking radiation. In addition, we compare these findings with statistical mechanics and provide an interpretation for the replica parameter $n$. Finally, we generalize the island formula to accommodate the finite $n$ case under this interpretation.</p>

            <p>Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.</p>

After introducing the mathematical framework, we apply the framework to a couple of applications. The first application is related to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing gain and loss phenomena, widely considered in the context of $PT$-quantum mechanics. The second application is related to a finite-dimensional version of the Swanson Hamiltonian, never considered before, and addresses the problem of deriving a milder version of the RDM when exceptional points form in the system.</p>

            <p>Andreev spin qubits are a new qubit platform that merges superconductivity with semiconductor physics. The mechanisms dominating observed energy relaxation remain unidentified. We report here on three steps taken to address these questions in an InAs nanowire weak link. First, we designed a microwave readout circuit tuned to be directly sensitive to the spin-dependent inductance of the weak link so that higher orbital states are not necessary for readout -- this resulted in larger windows in parameter space in which the spin state properties can be probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering strategy to mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was fabricated by \textit{in situ} shadow evaporation, which has been shown to improve atomic-scale disorder. We show how our design allows characterization of the spin stability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and gate voltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasing rates are comparable with the best devices previously reported, suggestive that surface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are not linked to spin relaxation in InAs nanowires. Our design strategies are transferrable to novel materials platforms for Andreev qubits such as germanium and carbon.</p>

            <p>We perform $\textit{exact}$ half-line path integral quantization of flat, homogeneous cosmological models containing a perfect fluid acting as an internal clock, in a $D+1$ dimensional minisuperspace setup. We also discuss certain classes of operator ordering ambiguity inherent in such quantization procedures and argue that a particular ordering prescription in the quantum theory can preserve two symmetries, namely arbitrary lapse rescalings and general covariance, which are already present at the classical level. As a result of this imposition, a large class of quantum Hamiltonians differing by operator ordering produces the same inner products between quantum states. This imposition of the two symmetries of the classical minisuperspace models leads to a unique prescription for writing the quantum Hamiltonian for minisuperspace dimension $D\geq 2$. Interestingly, in the case of $D=1$, the lapse rescaling symmetry is lost in the quantum theory, leading to an essentially ambiguous description of the canonical theory. We provide general proof of this in the context of both canonical quantization and path integrals. We supply concrete examples to validate our findings further.</p>

            <h2>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Sharma, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones.

            <h2>Room-temperature quantum emission from $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS:Cu colloidal nanocrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yossef E. Panfil, Sarah M. Thompson, Gary Chen, Jonah Ng, Cherie R. Kagan, Lee C. Bassett</p>
            <p>We report room-temperature observations of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ quantum emitters in individual ZnS:Cu nanocrystals (NCs). Using time-gated imaging, we isolate the distinct, $\sim$3-$\mu$s-long, red photoluminescence (PL) emission of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects, enabling their precise identification and statistical characterization. The emitters exhibit distinct blinking and photon antibunching, consistent with individual NCs containing two to four $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects. The quantum emitters' PL spectra show a pronounced blue shift compared to NC dispersions, likely due to photochemical and charging effects. Emission polarization measurements of quantum emitters are consistent with a $\sigma$-character optical dipole transition and the symmetry of the $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defect. These observations motivate further investigation of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS NCs for use in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Biphotons and single photons with narrow bandwidths and long coherence times are essential to the realization of long-distance quantum communication (LDQC) and linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). In this Letter, we manipulate the biphoton wave functions of the spontaneous four-wave mixing in a two-level atomic ensemble with a single-laser pump scheme. Our innovative experimental approach enables the generation of biphotons with a sub-MHz bandwidth of 0.36 MHz, a record spectral brightness of $2.28\times10^7$${\rm s}^{-1}{\rm mW}^{-1}{\rm MHz}^{-1}$, and a temporally symmetric wave packet at moderate optical depth. The strong non-classical cross-correlation of the biphotons also enables the observation of heralded sub-MHz-linewidth single photons with a pronounced single-photon nature. The generation of sub-MHz-linewidth biphotons and single photons with a two-level atomic ensembles not only finds applications in quantum repeaters and large cluster states for LDQC and LOQC but also opens up the opportunity to miniaturize the biphoton or single-photon sources for chip-scale quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting the presence of chiral spin states in molecular nanomagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aman Ullah, Ziqi Hu, Alejandro Gaita-Ari√±o</p>
            <p>In a three-spin-center system, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions give rise to two ground-state doublets, each state within the doublet exhibiting distinct spin-spectrum chirality. This chirality becomes significant when external perturbations are introduced. We explored, from a theoretical perspective, the presence of spin-chirality in Lanthanide complexes that feature two magnetic centers. The applied electric-potential, couples to the system electric dipole moment ($\mu$), modifying the spin-orbit interaction ($\hat{L}.\hat{S}$). This modification is formally expressed through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), whose role is to selectively activate one spin state in the doublet pair, as confirmed by computing the scalar spin-chirality ($\chi$). To validate the presence of chiral spin states, we performed spin-dynamics simulations using the Liouville-von Neumann equation within the density matrix formalism. The initial state was prepared as a superposition $1/\sqrt{2}(\rho_{01}+\rho_{10})$, and its time evolution revealed that each state in the doublet acquires a distinct phase, indicating their residence in separate phase spaces. This also demonstrated that the fidelity of the initial prepared state remains stable over an extended period.</p>

            <p>We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy. Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Floquet engineering of point-gapped topological superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Ji, Hao Geng, Naeem Akhtar, Xiaosen Yang</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit two distinct topological classifications based on their gap structure: line-gap and point-gap topologies. Although point-gap topology is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, its systematic construction remains a challenge. Here, we present the Floquet engineering approach for realizing point-gapped topological superconductors. By combining Floquet theory with particle-hole symmetry (PHS), we show that a point gap hosting robust Majorana edge modes emerges at the overlap of Floquet bands with opposite winding numbers. In the thermodynamic limit, even weak non-Hermiticity opens a point gap from a gapless spectrum, driving a topological phase transition and breaking non-Bloch parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. This transition is accompanied by the appearance of the Floquet $Z_2$ skin effect. Furthermore, the point-gapped topological phase and the non-Bloch $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry exhibit size-dependent phenomena driven by the critical skin effect. Our work offers a new pathway for exploring the point-gapped topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weicen Dong, Qing-Dong Jiang, Matteo Baggioli</p>
            <p>Topological wave-packet dynamics provide a powerful framework for studying quantum transport in topological materials. However, extending this approach to non-Hermitian quantum systems presents several important challenges, primarily due to ambiguities in defining the Berry phase and the non-unitary evolution of the wave-packets when $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is broken. In this work, we adopt the complex Berry phase definition using the bi-orthogonal formalism and derive the semiclassical equations of motion (EOM) for a wave-packet in a non-Hermitian topological system. Interestingly, we find that the complex Berry curvature introduces both an anomalous velocity and an anomalous force into the semiclassical EOM. To validate the derived EOM, we design a non-Hermitian Haldane model featuring non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, where the imbalance in the NNN hopping amplitudes gives rise to an emergent `complex chirality'. We reveal that the real and imaginary components of the complex chirality dictate the signs of both the real and imaginary parts of the complex Berry curvature, as well as the direction and dissipation rate of the edge states. Our analytical findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the wave-packet dynamics. Finally, we suggest a potential experimental realization of this complex Haldane model using a non-Hermitian optical chiral cavity, providing a promising platform for testing our theoretical predictions.</p>

            <p>Methods from Quantum Information Theory are used to scrutinize quantum correlations encoded in the two-quark density matrix over light-cone momentum fractions $x_1$ and $x_2$. A non-perturbative three quark model light-cone wavefunction predicts significant non-classical correlations associated with the "entanglement negativity" measure for asymmetric and small quark momentum fractions. We perform one step of QCD scale evolution of the entire density matrix, not just its diagonal (dPDF), by computing collinearly divergent corrections due to the emission of a gluon. Finally, we present first qualitative numerical results for single-step scale evolution of quantum entanglement correlations in double quark PDFs. At a higher $Q^2$ scale, the non-classical correlations manifest in the dPDF for nearly symmetric momentum fractions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Schmidhuber, Seth Lloyd, Michele Reilly, Paolo Zanardi, Aaron Lauda</p>
            <p>Khovanov homology is a topological knot invariant that categorifies the Jones polynomial, recognizes the unknot, and is conjectured to appear as an observable in $4D$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. Despite its rich mathematical and physical significance, the computational complexity of Khovanov homology remains largely unknown. To address this challenge, this work initiates the study of efficient quantum algorithms for Khovanov homology. We provide simple proofs that increasingly accurate additive approximations to the ranks of Khovanov homology are DQC1-hard, BQP-hard, and #P-hard, respectively. For the first two approximation regimes, we propose a novel quantum algorithm. Our algorithm is efficient provided the corresponding Hodge Laplacian thermalizes in polynomial time and has a sufficiently large spectral gap, for which we give numerical and analytical evidence. Our approach introduces a pre-thermalization procedure that allows our quantum algorithm to succeed even if the Betti numbers of Khovanov homology are much smaller than the dimensions of the corresponding chain spaces, overcoming a limitation of prior quantum homology algorithms. We introduce novel connections between Khovanov homology and graph theory to derive analytic lower bounds on the spectral gap.</p>

            <p>The no-masking theorem says that masking quantum information is impossible in a bipartite scenario. However, there exist schemes to mask quantum states in multipartite systems. In this work, we show that, the joint measurement in the teleportation is really a masking process, when the apparatus is regarded as a quantum participant in the whole system. Based on the view, we present two four-partite maskers and a tripartite masker. One of the former provides a generalization in arbitrary dimension of the four-qubit scheme given by Li and Wang [Phys. Rev. A 98, 062306 (2018)], and the latter is precisely their tripartite scheme. The occupation probabilities and coherence of quantum states are masked in two steps of our schemes. And the information can be extracted naturally in their reverse processes.</p>

We demonstrate how to achieve a high success probability while keeping a short pulse width by optimizing the cavity transmittance parameter and the time-controlled exexternal field.

Then, we define complexity classes ${\sf RwBQP}$, ${\sf CBQP}$, and ${\sf AdPostBQP}$ as sets of decision problems solvable by polynomial-size quantum circuits with a polynomial number of rewinding operators, cloning operators, and adaptive postselections, respectively. Our main result is that ${\sf BPP}^{\sf PP}\subseteq{\sf RwBQP}={\sf CBQP}={\sf AdPostBQP}\subseteq{\sf PSPACE}$. As a byproduct of this result, we show that any problem in ${\sf PostBQP}$ can be solved with only postselections of events that occur with probabilities polynomially close to one. Under the strongly believed assumption that ${\sf BQP}\nsupseteq{\sf SZK}$, or the shortest independent vectors problem cannot be efficiently solved with quantum computers, we also show that a single rewinding operator is sufficient to achieve tasks that are intractable for quantum computation. Finally, we show that rewindable Clifford circuits remain classically simulatable, but rewindable instantaneous quantum polynomial time circuits can solve any problem in ${\sf PP}$.</p>

            <p>Over the past century, a large community within theoretical physics has been seeking a unified framework for quantum gravity. Yet, to date, there is still no experimental evidence of any non-classical features of gravity. While traditional experimental proposals would usually require immensely challenging Planck scale experiments, recent table-top protocols based on low-energy quantum control have opened a new avenue into the investigation of non-classical gravity. An approach that has sparked high interest, both in terms of experimental feasibility and of theoretical implications, is the indirect witnessing of non-classical gravity through the detection of its capacity to act as an entangling channel. Most discussions have been centred on the entanglement generation between two gravitationally coupled massive systems. In this work, we instead examine the entangling capacity of the gravitational interaction between two light pulses. We explain the main experimental and theoretical advantages of having a photonic protocol, and lay out the steps leading to the determination of the entangling phase, using the path integral formalism and linearised gravity. We establish a closed form formula for the entangling phase and provide an estimated order of magnitude of the average photon number required for the generation of appreciable phase. Using statistical analysis, we show how entanglement may be certified with lower phase signal.</p>

We analytically derive relations between cavity parameters, including transmittance, length, and effective cross-sectional area of the cavity, that minimize both the photon loss probability and the error rate due to temporal mode-mismatch by taking it into account as state-dependent pulse delay. We also investigate the effects of pulse distortion using numerical simulations for the case of short pulse duration. We believe that these analyses are the first to suggest that a cavity has an optimal length for the atom-photon gate, providing a fundamental guideline for implementing quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We present a scalable algorithm for solving the transport equation in two and three spatial dimensions for variable grid sizes and discrete velocities on a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer. As a proof of concept of our quantum transport method (QTM), we describe a full-circuit start-to-end implementation in Qiskit and present numerical results for 2D flows. Our QTM is based on a novel streaming approach which leads to a reduction in the amount of CNOT gates required in comparison to state-of-the-art quantum streaming methods. As a second highlight we present a novel object encoding method, that reduces the complexity of the amount of CNOT gates required to encode walls, which now becomes independent of the size of the wall. Finally we present a novel quantum encoding of the particles' discrete velocities that enables a linear speed-up in the costs of reflecting the velocity of a particle, which now becomes independent of the amount of velocities encoded. Our main contribution is a detailed description of a fail-safe implementation of a quantum algorithm for the reflection step of the transport equation that can be readily implemented on a physical quantum computer. This fail-safe implementation allows for a variety of initial conditions and particle velocities and leads to physically correct behavior around the walls, edges and corners of obstacles. Combining these results we present a novel and fail-safe start-to-end quantum algorithm for the transport equation that can be used for a multitude of flow configurations. We finally show that our approach is quadratic in the amount of qubits necessary to encode the grid and the amount of qubits necessary to encode the discrete velocities in a single spatial dimension, which makes our approach superior to state-of-the-art approaches known in the literature.</p>

            <p>The design of quantum protocols for secure key generation poses many challenges: On the one hand, they need to be practical concerning experimental realisations. On the other hand, their theoretical description must be simple enough to allow for a security proof against all possible attacks. Often, these two requirements are in conflict with each other, and the differential phase shift (DPS) QKD protocol exemplifies these difficulties: It is designed to be implementable with current optical telecommunication technology, which, for this protocol, comes at the cost that many standard security proof techniques do not apply to it. After about 20 years since its invention, this work presents the first full security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks, including finite-size effects. The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD protocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints. We then show that security of DPS QKD can be reduced to security of the relativistic protocol. In addition, we show that coherent attacks on the DPS protocol are, in fact, stronger than collective attacks. Our results have broad implications for the development of secure and reliable quantum communication technologies, as they shed light on the range of applicability of state-of-the-art security proof techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merel A. Schalkers, Matthias M√∂ller</p>
            <p>In recent years, quantum Boltzmann methods have gained more and more interest as they might provide a viable path towards solving fluid dynamics problems on quantum computers once this emerging compute technology has matured and fault-tolerant many-qubit systems become available. The major challenge in developing a start-to-end quantum algorithm for the Boltzmann equation consists in encoding relevant data efficiently in quantum bits (qubits) and formulating the streaming, collision and reflection steps as one comprehensive unitary operation. The current literature on quantum Boltzmann methods mostly proposes data encodings and quantum primitives for individual phases of the pipeline assuming that they can be combined to a full algorithm. In this paper we disprove this assumption by showing that for encodings commonly discussed in literature either the collision or the streaming step cannot be unitary. Building on this landmark result we propose a novel encoding in which the number of qubits used to encode the velocity depends on the number of time steps one wishes to simulate, with the upper bound depending on the total number of grid points. In light of the non-unitarity result established for existing encodings, our encoding method is to the best of our knowledge the only one currently known that can be used for a start-to-end quantum Boltzmann solver where both the collision and the streaming step are implemented as a unitary operation. Furthermore our theoretical unitarity result can serve as a guideline on which types of encodings to consider or whether a `stop-and-go' method with repeated measurements and re-initializations is the method of choice.</p>

As an example, we have modeled an interferometer that senses multiple phase shifts along the same path, demonstrating a maximal quantum advantage by combining a coherent state with squeezed vacuum. Further classical modeling with up to 100 phases shows linear scaling potential for adding nodes to the sensor. The approach represents a new paradigm in multiparameter quantum metrology, and can be applied to remote sensing, geophysical surveying, and infrastructure monitoring.</p>

            <p>A major thrust in quantum algorithm development over the past decade has been the search for the quantum algorithms that will deliver practical quantum advantage first. Today's quantum computers - and even early fault-tolerant quantum computers - are limited in the number of operations they can implement per circuit. We introduce quantum algorithms for ground-state energy estimation (GSEE) that accommodate this design constraint. The first algorithm estimates ground-state energies, offering a quadratic improvement on the ground state overlap parameter compared to other methods in this regime. The second algorithm certifies that the estimated ground-state energy is within a specified error tolerance of the true ground-state energy, addressing the issue of gap estimation that beleaguers several ground state preparation and energy estimation algorithms. We note, however, that the scaling of this certification technique is currently less favorable than that of the GSEE algorithm. To develop the certification algorithm, we propose a novel use of quantum computers to facilitate rejection sampling. After a classical computer generates initial samples, the quantum computer is used to accept or reject these samples, resulting in a set of accepted samples that approximate draws from a target distribution. Although we apply this technique specifically for ground-state energy certification, it may find broader applications. Our work pushes the boundaries of what operation-limited quantum computers can achieve, bringing the prospect of quantum advantage closer to realization.</p>

            <p>Leakage errors, in which a qubit is excited to a level outside the qubit subspace, represent a significant obstacle in the development of robust quantum computers. We present a computationally efficient simulation methodology for studying leakage errors in quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) using tensor network methods, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). Our approach enables the simulation of various leakage processes, including thermal noise and coherent errors, without approximations (such as the Pauli twirling approximation) that can lead to errors in the estimation of the logical error rate. We apply our method to two QECCs: the one-dimensional (1D) repetition code and a thin $3\times d$ surface code. By leveraging the small amount of entanglement generated during the error correction process, we are able to study large systems, up to a few hundred qudits, over many code cycles. We consider a realistic noise model of leakage relevant to superconducting qubits to evaluate code performance and a variety of leakage removal strategies. Our numerical results suggest that appropriate leakage removal is crucial, especially when the code distance is large.</p>

            <p>In this work we investigate the effects that multi-mode photonic environments, e.g., optical cavities, have on the properties of quantum matter. We highlight the importance of the non-perturbative mass renormalization procedure for ab initio quantum electrodynamics simulations and how it connects to common approximations used in polaritonic chemistry and cavity materials engineering. We focus on one-dimensional systems which can be solved exactly for large number of photon modes. First, we apply mass renormalization to free particles. The value of the renormalized mass depends on the details of the photonic environment and on the number of particles. We then show how the multi-mode photon field influences various ground- and excited-state properties of atomic and molecular systems. For instance, we observe the enhancement of particle confinement in the binding potential for the atomic system, and the modification of the potential energy surfaces of the molecular dimer due to photon-mediated long-range interactions. We also highlight how these changes compare to the common free-space mass-renormalization approximation employed in electronic structure theory and quantum chemistry. Since such phenomena are enhanced under strong light-matter coupling in a cavity environment they will become relevant for the emerging fields of polaritonic chemistry and cavity materials engineering.</p>

            <p>We explore the concept of emergent quantum-like theory in complex adaptive systems, and examine in particular the concrete example of such an emergent (or "mock") quantum theory in the Lotka-Volterra system. In general, we investigate the possibility of implementing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics on classical systems, and what would be the conditions for using such an approach. We start from a standard description of a classical system via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation and reduce it to an effective Schr√∂dinger-type equation, with a (mock) Planck constant $\mockbar$, which is system-dependent. The condition for this is that the so-called quantum potential VQ, which is state-dependent, is cancelled out by some additional term in the HJ equation. We consider this additional term to provide for the coupling of the classical system under consideration to the "environment." We assume that a classical system could cancel out the VQ term (at least approximately) by fine tuning to the environment. This might provide a mechanism for establishing a stable, stationary states in (complex) adaptive systems, such as biological systems. In this context we emphasize the state dependent nature of the mock quantum dynamics and we also introduce the new concept of the mock quantum, state dependent, statistical field theory. We also discuss some universal features of the quantum-to-classical as well as the mock-quantum-to-classical transition found in the turbulent phase of the hydrodynamic formulation of our proposal. In this way we reframe the concept of decoherence into the concept of "quantum turbulence," i.e. that the transition between quantum and classical could be defined in analogy to the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in hydrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Echo-evolution data generation for quantum error mitigation via neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D.V. Babukhin</p>
            <p>Neural networks provide a prospective tool for error mitigation in quantum simulation of physical systems. However, we need both noisy and noise-free data to train neural networks to mitigate errors in quantum computing results. Here, we propose a physics-motivated method to generate training data for quantum error mitigation via neural networks, which does not require classical simulation and target circuit simplification. In particular, we propose to use the echo evolution of a quantum system to collect noisy and noise-free data for training a neural network. Under this method, the initial state evolves forward and backward in time, returning to the initial state at the end of evolution. When run on a noisy quantum processor, the resulting state will be affected by the quantum noise accumulated during evolution. Having a vector of observable values of the initial (noise-free) state and the resulting (noisy) state allows us to compose training data for a neural network. We demonstrate that a feed-forward fully connected neural network trained on echo-evolution-generated data can correct results of forward-in-time evolution. Our findings can enhance the application of neural networks to error mitigation in quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Puviani, Sangkha Borah, Remmy Zen, Jan Olle, Florian Marquardt</p>
            <p>Bosonic codes allow the encoding of a logical qubit in a single component device, utilizing the infinitely large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator. In particular, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code has recently been demonstrated to be correctable well beyond the break-even point of the best passive encoding in the same system. Current approaches to quantum error correction (QEC) for this system are based on protocols that use feedback, but the response is based only on the latest measurement outcome. In our work, we use the recently proposed Feedback-GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering with Feedback) method to train a recurrent neural network that provides a QEC scheme based on memory, responding in a non-Markovian way to the full history of previous measurement outcomes, optimizing all subsequent unitary operations. This approach significantly outperforms current strategies and paves the way for more powerful measurement-based QEC protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Setty, Rasul Abdusalamov, Felix Motzoi</p>
            <p>Chebyshev polynomials have shown significant promise as an efficient tool for both classical and quantum neural networks to solve linear and nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we adapt and generalize this framework in a quantum machine learning setting for a variety of problems, including the 2D Poisson's equation, second-order linear differential equation, system of differential equations, nonlinear Duffing and Riccati equation. In particular, we propose in the quantum setting a modified Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (SAPINN) approach, where self-adaptive weights are applied to problems with multi-objective loss functions. We further explore capturing correlations in our loss function using a quantum-correlated measurement, resulting in improved accuracy for initial value problems. We analyse also the use of entangling layers and their impact on the solution accuracy for second-order differential equations. The results indicate a promising approach to the near-term evaluation of differential equations on quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Designing fast quantum gates using optimal control with a reinforcement-learning ansatz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijita Sarma, Michael J. Hartmann</p>
            <p>Fast quantum gates are crucial not only for the contemporary era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices but also for the prospective development of practical fault-tolerant quantum computing. Leakage errors, which arise from data qubits jumping beyond the confines of the computational subspace, are the main challenges in realizing non-adiabatically driven, fast gates. In this work, we propose and illustrate the usefulness of reinforcement learning (RL) to generate fast two-qubit gates in practical multilevel superconducting qubits. In particular, we show that the RL controller offers great effectiveness in finding piecewise constant gate pulse sequences that act on two transmon data qubits coupled by a tunable coupler to generate a controlled-Z (CZ) gate with a gate time of 10 ns and an error rate of $\sim 4\times 10^{-3}$. Using a gradient-based method to solve the same optimization problem often does not achieve high fidelity for such fast gates. However, we show that using the gate pulses discovered by RL as an ansatz for the gradient-based controller can substantially enhance fidelity compared to using RL alone. While for a 10 ns pulse, this improvement is marginal, the combined RL + gradient approach decreases the gate errors below $10^{-4}$ for a gate of length 20 ns.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor single-photon detectors cannot be straightforwardly adapted for the microwave regime, primarily because microwave photons carry far less energy and thus require cryogenic temperatures and specialized architectures. Here, we propose a hybrid spin-optomechanical interface to detect single microwave photons where the microwave photons are coupled to a phononic resonator via piezoelectric actuation. This phononic cavity also acts as a photonic cavity with either a single embedded Silicon-Vacancy (SiV) center in diamond or an ensemble of these centers, bridging optical single-photon detection protocols into the microwave domain. We model the detection process as a communication channel whose capacity is quantified by the mutual information \(I(A;B)\) between the true photon occupancy (A) and the detector outcome (B). Depending on experimentally achievable parameters, simulations predict \(I(A;B)\) in the range \(0.57\,\ln(2)\) to \(0.67\,\ln(2)\), corresponding to true-positive (detection) probabilities above 90\% and false-positive (dark count) probabilities below 10\% per detection interval. These results suggest a viable path to low-noise, high-efficiency single-photon detection at microwave frequencies.</p>

            <p>Entanglement plays a crucial role in the development of quantum-enabled devices. One significant objective is the deterministic creation and distribution of entangled states, achieved, for example, through a mechanical oscillator interacting with confined electromagnetic fields. In this study, we explore a cavity resonator containing a two-sided perfect mirror. Although the mirror separates the cavity modes into two independent confined electromagnetic fields, the radiation pressure interaction gives rise to high-order effective interactions across all subsystems. Depending on the chosen resonant conditions, which are also related to the position of the mirror, we study $2n$-photon entanglement generation and bilateral photon pair emission. Demonstrating the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator, we provide a pathway to control these phenomena, opening potential applications in quantum technologies. Looking ahead, similar integrated devices could be used to entangle subsystems across vastly different energy scales, such as microwave and optical photons.</p>

            <h2>On the significance of Wigner's Friend in contexts beyond quantum foundations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline L. Jones, Markus P. Mueller</p>
            <p>There has been a surge of recent interest in the Wigner's Friend paradox, sparking several novel thought experiments and no-go theorems. The main narrative has been that Wigner's Friend highlights a counterintuitive feature that is unique to quantum theory, and which is closely related to the quantum measurement problem. Here, we challenge this view. We argue that the gist of the Wigner's Friend paradox can be reproduced without assuming quantum physics, and that it underlies a much broader class of enigmas in the foundations of physics and philosophy. To show this, we first consider several recently proposed Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios, and demonstrate that some of their implications for the absoluteness of observations can be reproduced by classical thought experiments that involve the duplication of agents. Crucially, some of these classical scenarios are technologically much easier to implement than their quantum counterparts. Then, we argue that the essential structural ingredient of all these scenarios is a feature that we call "Restriction A": essentially, that a physical theory cannot give us a probabilistic description of the observations of all agents. Finally, we argue that this difficulty is at the core of other puzzles in the foundations of physics and philosophy, and demonstrate this explicitly for cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem. Our analysis suggests that Wigner's Friend should be studied in a larger context, addressing a frontier of human knowledge beyond quantum foundations: to obtain reliable predictions for experiments in which these predictions can be privately but not intersubjectively verified.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Navarro, Ricard Ravell Rodr√≠guez, Mikel Sanz</p>
            <p>The Cram√©r-Rao bound serves as a crucial lower limit for the mean squared error of an estimator in frequentist parameter estimation. Paradoxically, it requires highly accurate prior knowledge of the estimated parameter for constructing the optimal unbiased estimator. In contrast, Bhattacharyya bounds offer a more robust estimation framework with respect to prior accuracy by introducing additional constraints on the estimator. In this work, we examine divergences that arise in the computation of these bounds and establish the conditions under which they remain valid. Notably, we show that when the number of constraints exceeds the number of measurement outcomes, an estimator with finite variance typically does not exist. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the properties of these bounds using paradigmatic examples, comparing them to the Cram√©r-Rao and Bayesian approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Camille L Latune, Cyril Elouard</p>
            <p>Considering a general microscopic model for a quantum measuring apparatus comprising a quantum probe coupled to a thermal bath, we analyze the energetic resources necessary for the realization of a quantum measurement, which includes the creation of system-apparatus correlations, the irreversible transition to a statistical mixture of definite outcomes, and the apparatus resetting. Crucially, we do not resort to another quantum measurement to capture the emergence of objective measurement results, but rather exploit the properties of the thermal bath which redundantly records the measurement result in its degrees of freedom, naturally implementing the paradigm of quantum Darwinism. In practice, this model allows us to perform a quantitative thermodynamic analysis of the measurement process. From the expression of the second law, we show how the minimal required work depends on the energy variation of the system being measured plus information-theoretic quantities characterizing the performance of the measurement -- efficiency and completeness. Additionally, we show that it is possible to perform a thermodynamically reversible measurement, thus reaching the minimal work expenditure, and provide the corresponding protocol. Finally, for finite-time measurement protocols, we illustrate the increasing work cost induced by rising entropy production inherent in finite-time thermodynamic processes. This highlights an emerging trade-off between velocity of the measurement and work cost, on top of a trade-off between efficiency of the measurement and work cost. We apply those findings to bring new insights in the thermodynamic balance of the measurement-powered quantum engines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Shastri, Chao Jiang, Guo-Hua Xu, B. Prasanna Venkatesh, Gentaro Watanabe</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a universal method to obtain fast charging of a quantum battery by a driven charger system using controlled, pure dephasing of the charger. While the battery displays coherent underdamped oscillations of energy for weak charger dephasing, the quantum Zeno freezing of the charger energy at high dephasing suppresses the rate of transfer of energy to the battery. Choosing an optimum dephasing rate between the regimes leads to a fast charging of the battery. We illustrate our results with the charger and battery modeled by either two-level systems or harmonic oscillators. Apart from the fast charging, the dephasing also renders the charging performance more robust to detuning between the charger, drive, and battery frequencies for the two-level systems case.</p>

            <p>In the quest for robust and universal quantum devices, the notion of simulation plays a crucial role, both from a theoretical and from an applied perspective. In this work, we go beyond the simulation of quantum channels and quantum measurements, studying what it means to simulate a collection of measurements, which we call a multimeter. To this end, we first explicitly characterize the completely positive transformations between multimeters. However, not all of these transformations correspond to valid simulations, as otherwise we could create any resource from nothing. For example, the set of transformations includes maps that always prepare the same multimeter regardless of the input, which we call trash-and-prepare. From the perspective of an experimenter with a given multimeter as part of a complicated setup, having to discard the multimeter and using a different one instead is undesirable. We give a new definition of multimeter simulations as transformations that are triviality-preserving, i.e., when given a multimeter consisting of trivial measurements they can only produce another trivial multimeter. In the absence of a quantum ancilla, we then characterize the transformations that are triviality-preserving and the transformations that are trash-and-prepare. Finally, we use these characterizations to compare our new definition of multimeter simulation to three existing ones: classical simulations, compression of multimeters, and compatibility-preserving simulations.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has been pursued with various hardware platforms, and an optical system is one of the most reasonable choices for large-scale computation. In the optical continuous-variable computation scheme, the incorporation of Gaussian gates and a highly non-classical non-Gaussian state enables universal quantum computation. Although basic technologies for Gaussian gates and non-Gaussian state generations have long been developed, these building blocks have not yet been integrated in a scalable fashion. Here, we integrate them to develop a scalable and programmable optical quantum computing platform that can sequentially perform an essential Gaussian gate, the squeezing gate, on a non-Gaussian input state. The key enablers are a loop-based optical circuit with dynamical and programmable controllability and its time-synchronization with the probabilistic non-Gaussian state generation. We verify the deterministic, programmable, and repeatable quantum gates on a typical non-Gaussian state by implementing up to three-step gates. The gates implemented are so high-quality that strong evidence of the states' non-classicalities, negativities of the Wigner functions, are preserved even after multistep gates. This platform is compatible with other non-Gaussian states and can in principle realize large-scale universal quantum computing by incorporating other existing processing technologies.</p>

Our study extends beyond the conventional framework by investigating the generalized angular momentum algebra within the context of Schwinger's oscillator model. This includes a detailed examination of the algebraic structures for combinations of bosonic-bosonic, bosonic-fermionic, and fermionic-fermionic oscillators. Through this, we delve into these systems' underlying symmetries and algebraic richness, shedding light on the intricate relationships between these different types of oscillators. In addition to these foundational aspects, we explore the broader implications of this generalized Schwinger approach. Our analysis touches upon potential applications and consequences of this formalism, offering insights that could be relevant to various areas of theoretical physics.

We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics.

            <p>Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum computers (quantum state preparation) and many others. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, i.e., the number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with respect either to the width, i.e, the number of ancilla qubits, or to the accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, i.e., the total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level. This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of the diffusion equation. This simulation paves the way to efficient implementations of stochastic models useful in physics, chemistry, biology, image processing and finance.</p>

            <p>The density classification (DC) task, a computation which maps global density information to local density, is studied using one-dimensional non-unitary quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Two approaches are considered: one that preserves the number density and one that performs majority voting.

One of the QCAs is based on a known classical probabilistic cellular automaton which has been studied in the context of DC. The second is a new quantum model that is designed to demonstrate additional quantum features and is restricted to only two-body interactions. Both can be generated by continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. A third QCA is a hybrid rule defined by both discrete-time and continuous-time three-body interactions that is shown to solve the majority voting problem within a time that scales linearly with the system size.</p>

            <p>Realizing quantum information processors is challenged by errors and noise across all platforms. While composite segmentation schemes have been proposed in many systems, their application to photonic quantum gates in dual-rail configurations has only recently been demonstrated. However, prior research has been limited to a small number of segments, full noise correlation, and has overlooked the inherent power loss in such designs. Here, we study the fidelity and power loss of composite designs for photonic quantum gates with a high number of segments of varying geometrical widths. Using numerical simulations, we analyze the relationship between gate performance and the number of waveguide segments, accounting for statistical error correlations and variances. Beyond effectively reducing the errors, an asymptotic scaling pattern of quantum gate fidelity and power loss is observed as the number of segments increases. This analysis is examined in Silicon and Lithium Niobate platforms, addressing practical implementation challenges. Our findings demonstrate that optimized multi-segment waveguide geometrical designs significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of photonic quantum gates, paving the way for more reliable quantum information processors.</p>

These algorithms have in common that whilst promising a speed-up in the performance of the algorithm, no specific method of measurement has been suggested. This means that while the algorithms presented in the literature may be promising methods for creating the quantum state that represents the final flow field, an efficient measurement strategy is not available. This paper marks the first quantum method proposed to efficiently calculate quantities of interest (QoIs) from a state vector representing the flow field. In particular, we propose a method to calculate the force acting on an object immersed in the fluid using a quantum version of the momentum exchange method (MEM) that is commonly used in lattice Boltzmann methods to determine the drag and lift coefficients. In order to achieve this we furthermore give a scheme that implements bounce back boundary conditions on a quantum computer, as those are the boundary conditions the momentum exchange method is designed for.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jielun Chen, Jiaqing Jiang, Dominik Hangleiter, Norbert Schuch</p>
            <p>We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</p>

            <p>Suspending devices on thin SiN membranes can limit their interaction with the bulk substrate and reduce parasitic capacitance to ground. While suspending devices on membranes is used in many fields including radiation detection using superconducting circuits, there has been less investigation into maximum membrane aspect ratios and achievable suspended device quality, metrics important to establish the applicable scope of the technique. Here, we investigate these metrics by fabricating superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators entirely atop thin ($\sim$110 nm) SiN membranes, where the membrane's shortest length to thickness yields an aspect ratio of approximately $7.4 \times 10^3$. We compare these membrane resonators to on-substrate resonators on the same chip, finding similar internal quality factors $\sim$$10^5$ at single photon levels. Furthermore, we confirm that these membranes do not adversely affect resonator thermalization and conduct further materials characterization. By achieving high quality superconducting circuit devices fully suspended on thin SiN membranes, our results help expand the technique's scope to potential uses including incorporating higher aspect ratio membranes for device suspension and creating larger footprint, high impedance, and high quality devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roland C. Farrell, Marc Illa, Martin J. Savage</p>
            <p>A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of composite particles in a simple model of dense matter that is amenable to quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Energy-limited quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauritz van Luijk</p>
            <p>We consider quantum systems with energy constraints relative to a reference Hamiltonian. In general, quantum channels and continuous-time dynamics need not satisfy energy conservation. Physically meaningful channels, however, only introduce a finite amount of energy to the system, and continuous-time dynamics only increase the energy gradually over time. We systematically study such "energy-limited" channels and dynamics. For Markovian dynamics, energy-limitedness is equivalent to a single operator inequality in the Heisenberg picture. We observe new submultiplicativity inequalities for the energy-constrained diamond and operator norms and use them to derive new state-dependent continuity bounds for quantum speed limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koushik Mandal</p>
            <p>In this work, the entanglement dynamics of different subsystems such as atom-atom, atom-field and field-field with radiation field in squeezed coherent thermal states for the intensity-dependent double Jaynes-Cummings model (IDDJCM) and double Jaynes-Cummings model (DJCM) are investigated. The effects of both squeezed photons and thermal photons on entanglement dynamics is observed. The main feature of the double Jaynes-Cummings model - entanglement sudden death is observed for every subsystem. The effects of various interactions such as Ising interaction, single photon exchange interaction and dipole-dipole interaction on entanglement dynamics are studied. The effects of detuning, Kerr-nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics are investigated for every subsystem. It is noticed that proper choice of the interactions parameters, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity effectively removes entanglement deaths from the dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Decoupling of External and Internal Dynamics in Driven Two-level Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel B√∂hringer, Alexander Friedrich</p>
            <p>We show how a laser driven two-level system including quantized external degrees of freedom for each state can be decoupled into a set of oscillator equations acting only on the external degrees of freedom with operator valued damping representing the detuning. We give a way of characterizing the solvability of this family of problems by appealing to a classical oscillator with time-dependent damping. As a consequence of this classification we (a) obtain analytic and representation-free expressions for Rabi oscillations including external degrees of freedom with and without an external linear potential, (b) show that whenever the detuning operator can be diagonalized (analytically or numerically) the problem decomposes into a set of classical equations and (c) we can use the oscillator equations as a perturbative basis to describe Rabi oscillations in weak but otherwise arbitrary external potentials. Moreover, chirping of the driving fields phase emerges naturally as a means of compensating the Ehrenfest/mean-value part of the detuning operator's dynamics while the presence of driving phase noise leads to a stochastic evolution equation of Langevin type. Lastly, our approach is representation free with respect to the external degrees of freedom and as consequence a suitable representation or basis expansion can be chosen a posteriori depending on the desired application at hand.</p>

            <p>In quantum information processing, two primary research directions have emerged: one based on discrete variables (DV) and the other on the structure of quantum states in a continuous-variable (CV) space. Integrating these two approaches could unlock new potentials, overcoming their respective limitations. Here, we show that such a DV-CV hybrid approach, applied to superconducting Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), enables us to entangle a pair of Schr√∂dinger's cat states by two methods. The first involves the entanglement-preserving conversion between Bell states in the Fock-state basis (DV encoding) and those in the cat-state basis (CV encoding). The second method implements a $\sqrt{\textrm{iSWAP}}$ gate between two cat states following the procedure for Fock-state encoding. This simple and fast gate operation completes a universal quantum gate set in a KPO system. Our work offers powerful applications of DV-CV hybridization and marks a first step toward developing a multi-qubit platform based on planar KPO systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William J. Huggins, Oskar Leimkuhler, Torin F. Stetina, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>The quantum simulation of real molecules and materials is one of the most highly anticipated applications of quantum computing. Algorithms for simulating electronic structure using a first-quantized plane wave representation are especially promising due to their asymptotic efficiency. However, previous proposals for preparing initial states for these simulation algorithms scale poorly with the size of the basis set. We address this shortcoming by showing how to efficiently map states defined in a Gaussian type orbital basis to a plane wave basis with a scaling that is logarithmic in the number of plane waves. Our key technical result is a proof that molecular orbitals constructed from Gaussian type basis functions can be compactly represented in a plane wave basis using matrix product states. While we expect that other approaches could achieve the same logarithmic scaling with respect to basis set size, our proposed state preparation technique is also highly efficient in practice. For example, in a series of numerical experiments on small molecules, we find that our approach allows us to prepare an approximation to the Hartree-Fock state using orders of magnitude fewer non-Clifford gates than a naive approach. By resolving the issue of state preparation, our work allows for the first quantum simulation of molecular systems whose end-to-end complexity is truly sublinear in the basis set size.</p>

            <p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in characterizing the complexity of quantum evolutions of interacting many-body systems. When a time-independent Hamiltonian governs the dynamics, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful tool. For unitary evolutions like kicked systems or Trotterized dynamics, a similar formulation based on the Arnoldi approach has been proposed yielding a new notion of quantum ergodicity [P. Suchsland, R. Moessner, and P. W. Claeys, Phys. Rev. B 111, 014309 (2025)].

            <p>We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Trotter product formulas constitute a cornerstone quantum Hamiltonian simulation technique. However, the efficient implementation of Hamiltonian evolution of nested commutators remains an under explored area. In this work, we construct optimized product formulas of orders 3 to 6 approximating the exponential of a commutator of two arbitrary operators in terms of the exponentials of the operators involved. The new schemes require a reduced number of exponentials and thus provide more efficient approximations than other previously published alternatives. They can also be used as basic methods in recursive procedures to increase the order of approximation. We expect this research will improve the efficiency of quantum control protocols, as well as quantum algorithms such as the Zassenhaus-based product formula, Magnus operator-based time-dependent simulation, and product formula schemes with modified potentials.</p>

            <p>We present a parallel between commutative and non-commutative polymorphisms. Our emphasis is the applications to conditional distributions from stochastic processes. In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite kernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by quantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the form of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator valued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive operator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states) are indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the non-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory helps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication of our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between the two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.</p>

            <h2>Conditional Diffusion-based Parameter Generation for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fanxu Meng, Xiangzhen Zhou, Pengcheng Zhu, Yu Luo</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that shows promise in efficiently solving the MaxCut problem, a representative example of combinatorial optimization. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the parameter optimization pipeline, where the parameter initialization strategy is nontrivial due to the non-convex and complex optimization landscapes characterized by issues with low-quality local minima. Recent inspiration comes from the diffusion of classical neural network parameters, which has demonstrated that neural network training can benefit from generating good initial parameters through diffusion models. Therefore, in this work, we formulate the problem of finding good initial parameters as a generative task and propose the initial parameter generation scheme through dataset-conditioned pre-trained parameter sampling. Concretely, the generative machine learning model, specifically the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is trained to learn the distribution of pretrained parameters conditioned on the graph dataset. Intuitively, our proposed framework aims at effectively distilling knowledge from pre-trained parameters to generate well-performing initial parameters for QAOA. Compared to random parameter initialization, experiments on various-sized Max-Cut problem instances consistently show that our conditional DDPM is capable of improving the approximation ratio by as much as 14.4%, 11.0%, 11.4% and 7.49%, 8.31%, 6.08% on average for random, regular, and Watts-Strogatz graphs, respectively. Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that the conditional DDPM trained on small problem instances can be extrapolated to larger ones, improving the approximation ratio by up to 28.4% and 12.1% on average.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Circuit Reusing and its Application in Randomized Benchmarking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo Chen, Guoding Liu, Xiongfeng Ma</p>
            <p>Quantum learning tasks often leverage randomly sampled quantum circuits to characterize unknown systems. An efficient approach known as "circuit reusing," where each circuit is executed multiple times, reduces the cost compared to implementing new circuits. This work investigates the optimal reusing parameter that minimizes the variance of measurement outcomes for a given experimental cost. We establish a theoretical framework connecting the variance of experimental estimators with the reusing parameter R. An optimal R is derived when the implemented circuits and their noise characteristics are known. Additionally, we introduce a near-optimal reusing strategy that is applicable even without prior knowledge of circuits or noise, achieving variances close to the theoretical minimum. To validate our framework, we apply it to randomized benchmarking and analyze the optimal R for various typical noise channels. We further conduct experiments on a superconducting platform, revealing a non-linear relationship between R and the cost, contradicting previous assumptions in the literature. Our theoretical framework successfully incorporates this non-linearity and accurately predicts the experimentally observed optimal R. These findings underscore the broad applicability of our approach to experimental realizations of quantum learning protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Manna, Vaibhav Madhok, Arul Lakshminarayan</p>
            <p>When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Generalised Circuit Partitioning for Distributed Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Burt, Kuan-Cheng Chen, Kin Leung</p>
            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a new paradigm aimed at scaling up quantum computing via the interconnection of smaller quantum processing units (QPUs). Shared entanglement allows teleportation of both states and gates between QPUs. This leads to an attractive horizontal scaling of quantum processing power, which comes at the expense of the additional time and noise introduced by entanglement sharing protocols. Consequently, methods for partitioning quantum circuits across multiple QPUs should aim to minimise the amount of entanglement-based communication required between distributed QPUs. Existing protocols tend to focus primarily on optimising entanglement costs for gate teleportation or state teleportation to cover operations between QPUs, rather than both at the same time. The most general form of the problem should treat gate and state teleportation on the same footing, allowing minimal cost circuit partitions through a combination of the two. This work introduces a graph-based formulation which allows joint optimisation of gate and state teleportation cost, including extensions of gate teleportation which group gates together for distribution using common resources. The formulation permits low e-bit cost for a variety of circuit types. Using a basic genetic algorithm, improved performance over state-of-the-art methods is obtained in terms of both average e-bit cost and time scaling.</p>

            <p>Quantum states of spin systems that can be represented with weighted graphs $G(V, E)$ are studied. The geometrical characteristics of these states are examined. We find that the velocity of quantum evolution is determined by the sum of the weighted degrees of the nodes in the graph, constructed by raising to the second power the weights in $G(V, E)$. The curvature depends on the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes in graphs constructed by raising the weights in $G(V, E)$ to the second and fourth powers. It also depends on the sum of the products of the weights of edges forming squares in graph $G(V, E)$. The torsion in addition is related to the sum of the products of the weights of edges in graph $G(V, E)$ forming triangles $S_3$. Geometric properties of quantum graph states and the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes have been calculated with quantum programming on IBM's quantum computer for the case of a spin chain.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-13]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation may greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single-qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with 0.9(3)% loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure a state-of-the-art CZ fidelity of 99.73(3)% when excluding atom-loss events, which may be mitigated through erasure conversion. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.</p>

            <p>Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) ans√§tze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce $k$-NI-DUCC, a fixed and Non-iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster compact ansatz, based on specific $"k"$ sets of "qubit" excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with $n$ being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs $"k"$ products of the exponential of $\mathcal{O}(n)$- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each operator has a length $p$. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit, $\mathcal{O}(knp)$, suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H$_6$ and BeH$_2$, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact Full Configuration Interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. While NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, the classical computational cost of constructing the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.</p>

            <p>Neutral atom (NA) quantum systems are emerging as a leading platform for quantum computation, offering superior or competitive qubit count and gate fidelity compared to superconducting circuits and ion traps. However, the unique features of NA devices, such as long-range interactions, long qubit coherence time, and the ability to physically move qubits, present distinct challenges for quantum circuit compilation. In this paper, we introduce DasAtom, a novel divide-and-shuttle atom approach designed to optimise quantum circuit transformation for NA devices by leveraging these capabilities. DasAtom partitions circuits into subcircuits, each associated with a qubit mapping that allows all gates within the subcircuit to be directly executed. The algorithm then shuttles atoms to transition seamlessly from one mapping to the next, enhancing both execution efficiency and overall fidelity. For a 30-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), DasAtom achieves a 414x improvement in fidelity over the move-based algorithm Enola and a 10.6x improvement over the SWAP-based algorithm Tetris. Notably, this improvement is expected to increase exponentially with the number of qubits, positioning DasAtom as a highly promising solution for scaling quantum computation on NA platforms.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</p>

            <p>This article proposes a formalism which unifies Hamiltonian simulation techniques from different fields. This formalism leads to a competitive method to construct the Hamiltonian simulation with a comprehensible, simple-to-implement circuit generation technique. It leads to a gate decomposition and a scaling different from the usual strategy based on a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) reformulation of the problem. It can significantly reduce the quantum circuit number of rotational gates, multi-qubit gates, and the circuit depth. This method leads to one exact Hamiltonian simulation for each summed term and Trotter step. Each of these Hamiltonian simulation unitary matrices also allows the construction of the non-exponential terms with a maximum of six unitary matrices to be Block-encoding (BE). The formalism is easy to apply to the widely studied Highorder Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO), fermionic transition Hamiltonian, and basic finite difference method instances. For the HUBO, our implementation exponentially reduces the number of gates for high-order cost functions with respect to the HUBO order. The individual electronic transitions are implemented without error for the second-quantization Fermionic Hamiltonian. Finite difference proposed matrix decompositions are straightforward, very versatile, and scale as the state-of-the-art proposals.</p>

            <h2>Engineering propagating cat states with driving-assisted cavity QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Kikura, Hayato Goto, Takao Aoki</p>
            <p>We propose a method for generating optical cat states in propagating pulses based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme uses multiple four-level systems (4LSs) inside an optical cavity as a light source. Time-modulating driving stimulates it to produce a superposition of coherent states entangled with the 4LSs. The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity. We find that its optimum value is formulated similarly to those of other generation methods for propagating states, suggesting a universal property of cavity-QED systems interacting with fields outside the cavity.</p>

            <h2>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshifumi Nakata, Yuki Takeuchi, Martin Kliesch, Andrew Darmawan</p>
            <p>We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Chih Liao, Ben J. Powell, Thomas M. Stace</p>
            <p>Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin D.M. Jones, Lana Mineh, Ashley Montanaro</p>
            <p>We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu. G. Peisakhovich, A. A. Shtygashev</p>
            <p>Within the framework of the rigorous quantum theory of the atomic photoeffect and the scenario of photoemission from a crystal as an inverse LEED process, pulsed photoemission from a flat thin-film photoemitter formed by a double quantum well on a dielectric substrate is investigated. The spatiotemporal dependences of the charge and current densities are calculated using the density matrix method. Asymptotic estimates are made in terms of the evolution of wave packets and the concepts of the extreme phase and fastest descent. The possibility of generating charge and current density waves as a result of the population and decay of quasi-stationary states of a doublet of a double quantum well under photoexcitation of electrons in conducting layers from inside this well is shown. For comparison, calculations were made for photoemission from a metal film on a substrate without a heterostructure: the double-well heterostructure increases, stabilizes, and extends the photocurrent pulse. A comparison of the contributions of the outgoing and incoming waves of the inverse LEED problem is made, and the relative smallness of the contribution of the incoming wave is quantitatively demonstrated</p>

            <p>The quantization of an optical field is a frontier in quantum optics with implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings this http URL composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Graph states are the key resources for measurement- and fusion-based quantum computing with photons, yet their creation is experimentally challenging. We optimize a hybrid graph-state generation scheme using a single quantum emitter and linear optics Bell-state measurements, called fusions. We first generate a restricted class of states from a single quantum emitter and then apply fusions to create a target graph state, where we use a dynamic programming approach to find the construction that requires the lowest possible number of fusions. Our analysis yields a lookup table for constructing $\sim 2.8\times 10^7$ non-isomorphic graph states with the minimum number of fusions. The lookup table covers all graph states with up to eight qubits and several other ones with up to 14 qubits. We present construction protocols of selected graph states and provide the lookup table. For large graph states that are not in the lookup table, we derive bounds for the required number of fusions using graph-theoretic properties. Finally, we use the lookup table to search for the best graph codes for loss-tolerant encodings, given a fixed number of fusions for their construction.</p>

            <p>Magnon blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon for generating single-magnon state, which gradually becomes one of the candidates for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to generate the magnon blockade in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG micromagnet and a skyrmion. Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the skyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived, and the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified. Under the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter regimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field intensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced, effectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of high-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching. Furthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade, revealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional magnon blockade. This scheme provides a versatile all-magnetic platform for generating high purity single-magnon sources.</p>

            <p>Non-equilibrium spin-chain systems have been attracting increasing interest in energy transport. This work studies a one-dimensional non-equilibrium Ising chain immersed in a tilted magnetic field, every spin contacts a Boson reservoir with the dissipative system-environment interaction. We analytically investigate the dynamics and the steady-state energy transport taking advantage of the Born-Markov-secular master equation. In the longitudinal field, one can find that the non dissipative $N^\prime$ spins decompose the spin chain into $N^\prime +1$ independent subchains and block the heat currents from the hot end to the cool end. Moreover, for the non-dissipative $\mu$th spin, its nearest two bulk spins become the nodal spins in the subchains and have the corresponding energy correction of $\pm J_{\mu-1,\mu}$ and $\pm J_{\mu,\mu+1}$ depending on the excited/ground state of the $\mu$th spin. Therefore, a magnetically controlled heat modulator can be designed by adjusting the direction of the magnetic field in which the non-dissipative spin is located. For the transverse field case, the whole Hilbert space of the chain can always be divided into two independent subspaces regardless of whether the bulk spin is dissipative. This work provides new insight into the dynamics and energy transport of the dissipative Ising model.</p>

            <p>The debate whether the von Neumann (VN) entropy is a suitable quantum version of the thermodynamic (TH) entropy has a long history. In this regard, we briefly review some of the main reservations about the VN entropy and explain that the objections about its time-invariance and subadditivity properties can be addressed convincingly. In a broader context, we here analyze in detail whether and when the VN entropy is the same or equivalent to the TH entropy. We find that the VN entropy of a large isolated system is equivalent to its TH entropy if the system is in a mixed state described by a microcanonical (MC) ensemble. This equivalence also holds for open system and subsystem if the full system (i.e. system-bath or subsystem-bath combination) is in a mixed state described by an MC ensemble or in a {\it typical} pure state (or if the {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis}, {\it ETH}, holds for the full system). Unlike isolated and open system, demonstrating the equivalence for a subsystem is not straightforward. We take a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model to numerically show that, if the full system is in a pure state, then the VN entropy of a subsystem is equivalent to its TH entropy if the {\it ETH} holds for the full system. We also demonstrate that this equivalence always works (irrespective of whether the {\it ETH} holds) if the full system is in a mixed state describe by an MC ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Husein Natur, Uzi Pereg</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.</p>

            <p>Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube.

And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</p>

            <p>Understanding the relationship between various different forms of nonclassicality and their resource character is of great importance in quantum foundation and quantum information. Here, we discuss a quantitative link between quantum entanglement and the anomalous or nonclassical nonreal values of Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability, in a bipartite setting. We first construct an entanglement monotone for a pure bipartite state based on the nonreality of the KD quasiprobability defined over a pair of orthonormal bases in which one of them is a product, and optimizations over these bases. It admits a closed expression as a Schur-concave function of the state of the subsystem having a form of nonadditive quantum entropy. We then construct a bipartite entanglement monotone for generic quantum states using the convex roof extension. Its normalized value is upper bounded by the concurrence of formation, and for two-qubit systems, they are equal. We also derive lower and upper bounds in terms of different forms of uncertainty in the subsystem quantified respectively by an extremal trace-norm asymmetry and a nonadditive quantum entropy. The entanglement monotone can be expressed as the minimum total state disturbance due to a nonselective local binary measurement. Finally, we discuss its estimation using weak value measurement and classical optimization, and its connection with strange weak value and quantum contextuality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergei Khlebnikov</p>
            <p>Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's "atoms," say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to Gaussian environments.</p>

We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maritza Ahumada, Natalia Valderrama-Quinteros, Guillermo Romero</p>
            <p>Periodically driving a quantum many-body system can drastically change its properties, leading to exotic non-equilibrium states of matter without a static analog. In this scenario, parametric resonances and the complexity of an interacting many-body system are pivotal in establishing non-equilibrium states. We report on a Floquet-engineered transverse field Ising model for the controlled propagation in one dimension of spin waves. The underlying mechanisms behind our proposal rely on high-frequency drivings using characteristic parametric resonances of the spin lattice. Many-body resonances modulating spin-sping exchange or individual spin gaps inhibit interactions between spins thus proving a mechanism for controlling spin-wave propagation and a quantum switch. Our schemes may have applications in coupling-decoupling schemes for system-reservoir interaction, and routing in quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Rongtao Wang, Jiaxin Pan</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</p>

            <h2>General detectability measure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahito Hayashi</p>
            <p>Distinguishing resource states from resource-free states is a fundamental task in quantum information. We have approached the state detection problem through a hypothesis testing framework, with the alternative hypothesis set comprising resource-free states in a general context. Consequently, we derived the optimal exponential decay rate of the failure probability for detecting a given $n$-tensor product state when the resource-free states are separable states, positive partial transpose (PPT) states, or the convex hull of the set of stabilizer states. This optimal exponential decay rate is determined by the minimum of the reverse relative entropy, indicating that this minimum value serves as the general detectability measure. The key technique of this paper is a quantum version of empirical distribution.</p>

            <h2>Strong and noise-tolerant entanglement in dissipative optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong, Dong Wang, Liu Ye</p>
            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as critical quantum resources in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in optomechanical systems with purely dispersive coupling over the past decades. However, quantum entanglement, induced by purely dissipative coupling, remains unexplored. In this work, we study quantum entanglement in a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer, where the dispersive and the dissipative coupling can be arbitrarily switched on and off. With current experimental parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power with the purely dispersive (dissipative) coupling. Further, we find that quantum entanglement generated by purely dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more noise-tolerant than that generated by purely dispersive coupling. When both couplings coexist, entanglement is weakened due to interference. Our findings provide a promising path to engineer strong and noise-tolerant quantum entanglement in purely dissipative quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) theoretically provides information-theoretic security based on physical laws. However, imperfections in practice lead to the possibility of quantum hacking on the QKD implementation, especially the passive attacks that are difficult to be detected. In this paper, we study experimentally and theoretically the upper limit of a backflash attack, as one of the vital passive attacks, on a fiber-based QKD system. We experimentally demonstrate the backflash attack on a full equipped fiber-based QKD receiver to show its feasibility and limited distinguish ratio of decoding. More importantly, we have developed a simulation model to analyze the maximum distinguish ratio of decoding can be achieved considering the wide-spectrum feature of backflash photons, which indicates that Eve can extract effective key information from 95.7% of the backflash photons. Consequently, the secure key rate of the decoy-state BB84 QKD system under backflash attack is calculated. This work provides a general methodology to comprehensively evaluate the effect of the backflash attack on a QKD system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anwei Zhang, Jun-Won Rhim</p>
            <p>Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect is known to be intrinsic and requires time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that a new type of magneto-nonlinear Hall effect can occur in the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum origin arising from a geometric quantity associated with the Berry curvature and band velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking system by proposing a new kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.</p>

            <p>In information theory, we often use intersection and union of the typical sets to analyze various communication problems. However, in the quantum setting it is not very clear how to construct a measurement which behaves analogously to intersection and union of the typical sets. In this work, we construct a projection operator which behaves very similarly to intersection and union of the typical sets. Our construction relies on the Jordan's lemma. Using this construction we study the problem of communication over authenticated classical-quantum channels and derive its capacity. As another application of our construction, we also study the problem of quantum asymmetric composite hypothesis testing.</p>

            <p>As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $>4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soshun Ozaki, Hosho Katsura</p>
            <p>We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems, such as those with disorder or external kick terms, despite their large $N$ behavior differing from that of typical chaotic systems. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</p>

            <p>We prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if it is completely entropy-nonincreasing, where the relevant notion of entropy is a variant of von Neumann entropy. This adjusted von Neumann entropy is the negative of the relative entropy with respect to the uniform state on the C*-algebra, up to an additive constant. As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</p>

            <h2>Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2>0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.</p>

            <p>In this work, improvements are introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas by incorporating the quantum nature of phase space, directly linked to the uncertainty principle. These improved models leverage the recently developed concepts of quantum phase space and phase space representation of quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and quantum statistical mechanics is used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas.  Analytic expressions for thermodynamic quantities - including the grand canonical potential, particle number, internal energy, Von Neumann entropy, and pressure are derived, alongside the corresponding thermodynamic equations of state for both bosons and fermions. These corrections are particularly significant at low temperatures and in confined volumes, where quantum effects such as shape and size become prominent. The results also establish a direct link between thermodynamic functions and the quantum statistical variances of momenta.  Importantly, the improved models recover well-known classical relations of the ideal gas in the high-temperature and large-volume limits, ensuring consistency with classical physics. By addressing quantum corrections and their thermodynamic implications, this work provides a foundation for further applications in nanoscale systems, quantum gases, low-temperature physics, utra-cold physics and astrophysics.</p>

            <h2>Second-Order Moment Quantum Fluctuations and Quantum Equivalence Principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.J.Luo</p>
            <p>The second-order moment quantum fluctuations or uncertainties are mass-dependent, and the incompatibility between the quantum uncertainty principle and the equivalence principle is at the second-order moment (variation) level, but not the first-order moment (mean) level. To reconcile the two fundamental principles, we find that the second-order moment quantum fluctuations are actually distinguished into two parts: a dynamic part and a geometric part. The dynamic part is indeed mass-dependent and governed by a non-zero Hamiltonian in a non-general-covariant inertial frame, and the geometric part is mass-independent and comes from coarse-graining and/or geometric effects. The dynamic part is coordinate dependent, it can be canceled away by a coordinate transformation, and hence it plays no role in general covariant theories whose Hamiltonian automatically vanishes. However, the geometric part is valid for general coordinate, and it can not be eliminated by a coordinate transformation. On the contrary, the geometric part of second-order moment fluctuation of quantum spacetime leads to coordinate transformation anomaly, which induces an effective Einstein's gravity theory. The geometric part is mass-independent and universal, so it is only this part measures the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuation of the spacetime, while the dynamic part plays no role in the general covariant description. The observation generalizes the classical equivalence principle to the quantum level. And according to the principle, a general covariant theory with only geometric part quantum fluctuation, i.e. a non-linear sigma model, is proposed as a theory of a material quantum reference frame system. The effects of the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuations in the material quantum reference system and its implications to an effective gravity theory are also discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Maxwell Silvester, Giuseppe Carleo, Steven R. White</p>
            <p>In approximate ground states obtained from imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum of the state -- its decomposition into exact energy eigenstates -- falls off exponentially with the energy. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in the bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, independent of boundary or dimensionality, and are also observed in neural network wavefunctions. The unusual spectra can have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. The energy variance, which can be used to extrapolate observables to eliminate truncation error, is subject to these large fluctuations when sampled. Nevertheless, we devise a sampling-based variance approach which gives excellent and efficient extrapolations.</p>

            <p>The Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQR) are emerging quantum precision sensing platforms designed for receiving radio frequency (RF) signals. It relies on creation of Rydberg atoms from normal atoms by exciting one or more electrons to a very high energy level, thereby making the atom sensitive to RF signals. RAQRs realize RF-to-optical conversions based on light-atom interactions relying on the so called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Aulter-Townes splitting (ATS), so that the desired RF signal can be read out optically. The large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms associated with rich choices of Rydberg states and various modulation schemes facilitate an ultra-high sensitivity ($\sim$ nV/cm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) and an ultra-broadband tunability (direct-current to Terahertz). RAQRs also exhibit compelling scalability and lend themselves to the construction of innovative, compact receivers. Initial experimental studies have demonstrated their capabilities in classical wireless communications and sensing. To fully harness their potential in a wide variety of applications, we commence by outlining the underlying fundamentals of Rydberg atoms, followed by the principles and schemes of RAQRs. Then, we overview the state-of-the-art studies from both physics and communication societies. Furthermore, we conceive Rydberg atomic quantum single-input single-output (RAQ-SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) schemes for facilitating the integration of RAQRs with classical wireless systems. Finally, we conclude with a set of potent research directions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Novikau, Ilon Joseph</p>
            <p>We propose an explicit algorithm based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations technique to simulate both the advection-diffusion equation and a nonunitary discretized version of the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of nonlinear dynamics. By including dissipation into the model, through an upwind discretization of the advection operator, we avoid spurious parasitic oscillations which usually accompany standard finite difference discretizations of the advection equation. In contrast to prior works on quantum simulation of nonlinear problems, we explain in detail how different components of the algorithm can be implemented by using the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) methods. In addition, we discuss the general method for implementing the block-encoding (BE) required for QSP and QSVT circuits and provide explicit implementations of the BE oracles tailored to our specific test cases. We simulate the resulting circuit on a digital emulator of quantum fault-tolerant computers and investigate its complexity and success probability. The proposed algorithm is universal and can be used for modeling a broad class of linear and nonlinear differential equations including the KvN and Carleman embeddings of nonlinear systems, the semiclassical Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation, as well as the advection and Liouville equations.</p>

            <p>Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.</p>

In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</p>

Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations.

Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system.

The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments applied to combinatorial optimization problems. The results indicate that this method expands the applicability of quantum algorithms to high-dimensional problems and improves the practicality of classical optimization solvers for optimization problems involving inequality constraints.</p>

Here we report on the large-range optical frequency tuning of diamond SnV- centers using micro-electro-mechanically mediated strain control in photonic integrated waveguide devices. We realize a tuning range of >40 GHz, covering a major part of the inhomogeneous distribution. In addition, we employ real-time feedback on the strain environment to stabilize the resonant frequency and mitigate spectral wandering. These results provide a path for on-chip scaling of diamond SnV-based quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Generation of entanglement and non-stationary states via competing coherent and incoherent bosonic hopping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parvinder Solanki, Albert Cabot, Matteo Brunelli, Federico Carollo, Christoph Bruder, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>Incoherent stochastic processes added to unitary dynamics are typically deemed detrimental since they are expected to diminish quantum features such as superposition and entanglement. Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent non-stationary behavior.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Simulation of Quantum Secure Multiparty Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartick Sutradhar</p>
            <p>One of the key characteristics of secure quantum communication is quantum secure multiparty computation. In this paper, we propose a quantum secure multiparty summation (QSMS) protocol that can be applied to many complex quantum operations. It is based on the $(t, n)$ threshold approach. We combine the classical and quantum phenomena to make this protocol realistic and secure. Because the current protocols employ the $(n, n)$ threshold approach, which requires all honest players to execute the quantum multiparty summation protocol, they have certain security and efficiency problems. However, we employ a $(t, n)$ threshold approach, which requires the quantum summation protocol to be computed only by $t$ honest players. Our suggested protocol is more economical, practical, and secure than alternative protocols.</p>

For such hypotheses, we derive an upper bound of the optimal PUT achieved by classical mechanisms, which is tight for some cases, and propose a certain quantum mechanism which achieves a better PUT than the upper bound. The proposed quantum mechanism consists of a classical-quantum channel whose outputs are pure states corresponding to a symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM), and a depolarizing channel.</p>

            <p>Secure and reliable certification of quantum resources is a fundamental challenge in the advancement of next-generation quantum technologies, particularly as devices become more complex and integrated into practical applications, where parts of the system may be untrusted or inaccessible by users. Addressing this challenge requires certification methods that rely on minimal assumptions and limited trust while still faithfully and reliably verifying the quantum resources in question. For infinite-dimensional bosonic systems, existing certification methods rely on fully trusted and well calibrated measurement systems, leaving significant security vulnerabilities open. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of measurement-device-independent (MDI) certification schemes for infinite-dimensional bosonic systems, where the certification process is conducted using entirely untrusted measurement devices and assuming only the trusted preparation of coherent states. Specifically, we implement schemes for the MDI certification of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement and the operation of an elementary optical CV quantum memory. We leverage techniques of Bayesian metrology and exploit the practicality and accessibility of Gaussian quantum optics to achieve secure and efficient certification. These results demonstrate the potential of the MDI framework to enhance trust in quantum technologies with applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.</p>

Here, we present a theoretical framework that rigorously accounts for imperfect heterodyne measurements arising from phase imbalances in the coherent (heterodyne) receiver. Focusing on collective attacks, we establish a finite-size security proof that reveals how measurement imperfections limit the distance over which a positive key rate is achievable. To mitigate these effects, we propose a local transformation during classical post-processing. We validate our approach experimentally on a CVQKD system with an imperfect coherent receiver, underscoring its potential for scalable, cost-effective CVQKD with photonic integrated receivers in which phase-imbalances naturally appear through manufacturing tolerances.</p>

            <p>Quantum backflow, a counterintuitive interference phenomenon where particles with positive momentum can propagate backward, is important in applications involving light-matter interactions. To date, experimental demonstrations of backflow have been restricted to classical optical systems, where momentum is measured using the slit scanning technique or the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor technique. However, these techniques have low spatial resolution due to limitations in slit width and Fourier transform lenslet array density. Here, by adopting the technique of weak measurement, we report an observation of azimuthal backflow both theoretically and experimentally. Our results show that a heralded single photon, prepared in specific superposition states with solely negative orbital angular momentum (OAM), exhibits positive OAM. The effects of mode ratio, propagation distance and OAM index on the azimuthal backflow are systematically investigated. Our method avoids using slits and lenslet arrays, allowing for the accurate extraction of photon momentum at each pixel. This work provides new insights and techniques for observing and manipulating backflow in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate electrically tunable, spin-dependent, directional coupling of single photons by embedding quantum dots (QDs) in a waveguide-coupled nanocavity. The directional behavior arises from direction-dependent interference between two cavity modes when coupled to the device waveguides. The small mode volume cavity enables simultaneous Purcell enhancement (${10.8\pm0.7}$) and peak directional contrast (${88\pm1\%}$), exceeding current state-of-the-art waveguide-only systems. We also present a scattering matrix model for the transmission through this structure, alongside a quantum trajectory-based model for predicting the system's directionality, which we use to explain the observed asymmetry in directional contrast seen in QD devices. Furthermore, the nanocavity enables wide-range electrical tuning of the emitter's directional contrast. We present results showing precise tuning of a QD emission line from a directional contrast of ${2\%}$ to ${96\%}$. In combination, these characteristics make this cavity-waveguide approach promising for use as a building block in directional nanophotonic circuits.</p>

            <p>In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.</p>

            <p>The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error correction codes which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity.

We develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any stabilizer error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a minimal number of shuttling operations. In simulation, these heuristics show that fault tolerance can be achieved on several contemporary quantum error-correcting codes requiring only modestly-optimistic noise parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate how constant column-weight qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that scales constantly with code size using Shor-style syndrome extraction. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for codes not in that class.</p>

            <p>From fundamental sciences to economics and industry, discrete optimization problems are ubiquitous. Yet, their complexity often renders exact solutions intractable, necessitating the use of approximate methods. Heuristics inspired by classical physics have long played a central role in this domain. More recently, quantum annealing has emerged as a promising alternative, with hardware implementations realized on both analog and digital quantum devices. Here, we develop a heuristic inspired by quantum annealing, using Generalized Coherent States as a parameterized variational Ansatz to represent the quantum state. This framework allows for the analytical computation of energy and gradients with low-degree polynomial complexity, enabling the study of large problems with thousands of spins. Concurrently, these states capture non-trivial entanglement, crucial for the effectiveness of quantum annealing. We benchmark the heuristic on the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model and compare the solution quality and runtime of our method to other popular heuristics. Our findings suggest that it offers a scalable way to leverage quantum effects for complex optimization problems, potentially surpassing conventional alternatives in large-scale applications.</p>

            <p>A long-standing challenge in quantum computing is developing technologies to overcome the inevitable noise in qubits. To enable meaningful applications in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing, devising methods to suppress post-correction logical failures is becoming increasingly crucial. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the application of zero-noise extrapolation, a practical quantum error mitigation technique, to error correction circuits on state-of-the-art superconducting processors. By amplifying the noise on physical qubits, the circuits yield outcomes that exhibit a predictable dependence on noise strength, following a polynomial function determined by the code distance. This property enables the effective application of polynomial extrapolation to mitigate logical errors. Our experiments demonstrate a universal reduction in logical errors across various quantum circuits, including fault-tolerant circuits of repetition and surface codes. We observe a favorable performance in multi-round error correction circuits, indicating that this method remains effective when the circuit depth increases. These results advance the frontier of quantum error suppression technologies, opening a practical way to achieve reliable quantum computing in the early fault-tolerant era.</p>

            <p>Typically, the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem increases until it plateaus at the thermal value. Under some circumstances, however, the intermediate value can dwarf the final value, even if the subsystem starts in a pure state. A famous example in the context of the black hole information paradox is the entropy of the Hawking radiation, where this behaviour is dubbed the Page curve. More generally, this is the case for excited systems weakly coupled to cold reservoirs. Here we study the entropy dynamics for Lindbladian evolution, i.e. open quantum systems in weak contact with Markovian reservoirs. This allows us to study the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the subsystem entropy decrease and link it to Landauer's principle: the entropy decrease must be accompanied by a heat flow out of the system. We give an analytic expression of the entanglement dynamics for a decaying excitation in a two-level system and study it under equilibration of a localised oscillator. In both cases the Page time occurs when half the initial energy has left the system.</p>

            <p>The spectral structure of a photonic reservoir shapes radiation phenomena for embedded quantum emitters. We implement an all-optical analogue to study such an effect, particularly to observe the non-Markovian radiation dynamics of an emitter coupled to two-dimensional structured reservoirs. Its dynamics is simulated by light propagating through a photonic lattice, acting as a reservoir for an adjacent waveguide that mimics a coupled quantum emitter. We study radiation dynamics in square and Lieb lattices under different coupling regimes and observe how the flat band properties of the Lieb lattice significantly enhances light-matter coupling and non-Markovianity. Our platform opens a path for the experimental exploration of single photon quantum optical phenomena in structured reservoirs to enhance light-matter interactions.</p>

We theoretically investigate the formation and characteristics of heteronuclear ULRMs, focusing on Rb-Cs systems.

We also predict the formation of polyatomic heteronuclear ULRMs, discussing how the binding energy and spectral features evolve as the number of ground-state atoms increases. Our theoretical predictions are presented in terms of molecular spectra and provide insight into the formation dynamics of these systems. The study further explores the potential applications of heteronuclear ULRMs in quantum information processing, quantum simulation, and precision measurements, offering new avenues for future research in many-body physics and quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Dissociation of Bound Photon Pairs for a Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaming Shi, Alexander N. Poddubny</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaojiao Chen, Wei Xiong, Dong Wang, Liu Ye</p>
            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as critical quantum resources in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in optomechanical systems with purely dispersive coupling over the past decades. However, quantum entanglement, induced by purely dissipative coupling, remains unexplored. In this work, we study quantum entanglement in a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer, where the dispersive and the dissipative coupling can be arbitrarily switched on and off. With current experimental parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power with the purely dispersive (dissipative) coupling. Further, we find that quantum entanglement generated by purely dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more noise-tolerant than that generated by purely dispersive coupling. When both couplings coexist, entanglement is weakened due to interference. Our findings provide a promising path to engineer strong and noise-tolerant quantum entanglement in purely dissipative quantum systems.</p>

            <p>X ray matter interactions are intrinsically weak, and the high energy and momentum of X rays pose significant challenges to applying strong light matter coupling techniques that are highly effective at longer wavelengths for controlling and manipulating radiation. Techniques such as enhanced coupling between light and electrons at a metal dielectric interface or within nanostructures, as well as the Purcell effect where spontaneous emission is amplified near a metallic surface are not applicable to X rays due to their fundamentally different energy and momentum scales. Here we present a novel approach for coupling X rays to surface plasmon polaritons by entangling X ray photons with SPPs in the ultraviolet range through X ray to UV spontaneous parametric down conversion in aluminum. The distinct characteristics of the SPPs are imprinted onto the angular and energy dependence of the detected X ray photons, as demonstrated in this work. Our results highlight the potential to control X rays using SPPs, unlocking exciting opportunities to enhance X ray matter interactions and explore plasmonic phenomena with atomic scale resolution a capability uniquely enabled by X rays.</p>

            <p>Efficient, low-noise, high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical tranduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. Due to the quadratic scaling of transduction efficiency with the electro-optic coefficient, material classes with stronger Pockels effects, such as the perovskite titanates BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, may unlock new performance regimes for future transducers. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response, as well as limited process compatibility. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. Exploiting the bias-induced Pockels effect of BaTiO$_3$, we demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction at millikelvin temperatures and total off-chip efficiencies reaching $1\times10^{-6}$ in pulsed operation. We establish a device concept permitting in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss and tuning of the optical system without sacrificing microwave-optical overlap. Using a fully subtractive process, we fabricate Nb air bridges for crossings of conductors and both air- and oxide-clad optical waveguides. We investigate optically-induced heating through pulsed optical pumping, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept is applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and paves the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</p>

Reproducible interrogation conditions for mixed-species Coulomb crystals are ensured by a conditional preparation sequence with permutation control. We demonstrate clock operation with a 1In$^+$-3Yb$^+$ crystal, achieving a relative systematic uncertainty of $2.5\times10^{-18}$ and a relative frequency instability of $1.6\times10^{-15}/\sqrt{\tau/1\;\mathrm{s}}$. We report on absolute frequency measurements with an uncertainty of $1.3\times10^{-16}$ and optical frequency comparisons with clocks based on $^{171}$Yb$^+$ (E3) and $^{87}$Sr. With a fractional uncertainty of $4.4\times10^{-18}$, the former is - to our knowledge - the most accurate frequency ratio value reported to date. For the $^{115}$In$^+$/$^{87}$Sr ratio, we improve upon the best previous measurement by more than an order of magnitude. We also demonstrate operation with four $^{115}$In$^+$ clock ions, which reduces the instability to $9.2\times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/1\;\mathrm{s}}$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou</p>
            <p>By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</p>

To do so, we create a superfluid of light using paraxial, near-resonant laser beam propagating through a hot rubidium vapor. We excite a bounded vortex-antivortex dipole in the superfluid and observe its transition to a rarefaction pulse and back, in agreement with the seminal predictions of Jones and Roberts. Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aritra Ghosh, Bhabani Prasad Mandal, Bijan Bagchi</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present an analysis of the equation $\ddot{x} - (1/2x) \dot{x}^2 + 2 \omega^2 x - 1/8x = 0$, where $\omega > 0$ and $x = x(t)$ is a real-valued variable. We first discuss the appearance of this equation from a position-dependent-mass scenario in which the mass profile goes inversely with $x$, admitting a singularity at $x = 0$. The associated potential is also singular at $x = 0$, splitting the real axis into two halves, i.e., $x > 0$ and $x < 0$. The dynamics is exactly solvable for both the branches and so for definiteness, we stick to the $x > 0$ branch. Performing a canonical quantization in the position representation and upon employing the ordering strategy of the kinetic-energy operator due to von Roos, we show that the problem is isospectral with the isotonic oscillator. Thus, the quantum spectrum consists of an infinite number of equispaced levels which is in line with the expectation that classical systems that support isochronous oscillations are associated in their quantized versions with equally-spaced spectra. The spacing between energy levels is found to be insensitive to the specific choices of the ambiguity parameters that are employed for ordering the kinetic-energy operator √† la von Roos.</p>

            <h2>Secure Composition of Quantum Key Distribution and Symmetric Key Encryption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunal Dey, Reihaneh Safavi-Naini</p>
            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows Alice and Bob to share a secret key over an insecure channel with proven information-theoretic security against an adversary whose strategy is bounded only by the laws of physics. Composability-based security proofs of QKD ensure that using the established key with a one-time-pad encryption scheme provides information theoretic secrecy for the message. In this paper, we consider the problem of using the QKD established key with a secure symmetric key-based encryption algorithm and use an approach based on hybrid encryption to provide a proof of security for the composition. Hybrid encryption was first proposed as a public key cryptographic algorithm with proven security for messages of unrestricted length. We use an extension of this framework to correlated randomness setting (Sharifian et al. in ISIT 2021) to propose a quantum-enabled Key Encapsulation Mechanism (qKEM) and quantum-enabled hybrid encryption (qHE), and prove a composition theorem for the security of the qHE. We construct a qKEM with proven security using an existing QKD (Portmann et al. in Rev. of Mod. Physics 2022). Using this qKEM with a secure Data Encapsulation Mechanism (DEM), that can be constructed using a one-time symmetric key encryption scheme, results in an efficient encryption system for unrestricted length messages with proved security against an adversary with access to efficient computations on a quantum computer (i.e. post-quantum secure encryption without using any computational assumptions.)</p>

            <p>One of the most practical, and sought after, applications of quantum mechanics in the field of information science is the use of entanglement distribution to communicate quantum information effectively. Similar to the continued improvements of functional quantum computers over the past decade, advances in demonstrations of entanglement distribution over long distances may enable new applications in aeronautics and space communications. The existing NASA Quantum Communications Analysis Suite (NQCAS) software models such applications, but limited experimental data exists to verify the model's theoretical results. There is, however, a large body of experimental data in the relevant literature for entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD). This paper details a Monte Carlo-based QKD model that uses NQCAS input parameters to generate an estimated QKD link budget for verification of NQCAS. The model generates link budget statistics like key rates, error rates, and S values that can then be compared to the experimental values in the literature. Preliminary comparisons show many similarities between the simulated and experimental data, supporting the model's validity. A verified NQCAS model will inform experimental work conducted in Glenn Research Center's (GRC) NASA Quantum Metrology Laboratory (NQML), supporting the United States Quantum Initiative and potential NASA missions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Gen Li, Huatang Tan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atoms stand out as a highly promising platform for realizing quantum computation with significant advantages in constructing high-fidelity quantum gates. Floquet frequency modulation (FFM) is a potent approach for achieving resilient quantum gates through the manipulation of modulation parameters, thereby inducing intricate dynamics within quantum systems. This work introduces a method to realize controlled arbitrary phase gates in Rydberg atoms by manipulating system dynamics by the means of FFM. Notably, this method eliminates the need for laser addressing, significantly enhancing the convenience for future practical applications. Furthermore, this approach can be integrated with soft quantum control strategies to enhance the fidelity and robustness of the resultant controlled-phase gates. Finally, this methodology is applied in Grover's quantum search algorithms to prepare quantum states, demonstrating its substantial significance for future quantum information processing applications.

            <p>Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.</p>

Over 25 hours, we collect measurements on our campus network, where we measure sufficiently low quantum bit error rates (<5% in most cases) which in principle enable quantum digital signatures at over 50 km as shown through rigorous simulation accompanied by a noise model developed specifically for our implementation. These results show quantum digital signatures can be successfully employed over deployed fiber. Moreover, our reported method provides great flexibility in the number of users, but with reduced entanglement rate per user. Finally, while the current implementation of our entanglement-based approach has a low signature rate, feasible upgrades would significantly increase the signature rate.</p>

            <p>We investigate a generic tripartite quantum system featuring a single qubit interacting concurrently with two quantized harmonic oscillators via nonlinear multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings (MPJC) interactions. Assuming the qubit is initially prepared in a superposition state and the two oscillators are in arbitrary Fock states, we analytically trace the temporal evolution of this tripartite pure initial state. We identify four broad cases, each further divided into two subcases, and derive exact analytical solutions for most cases. Notably, we obtain perfect transfer of excitations between the oscillators by carefully selecting system parameters. In addition, we extensively examine the manner in which the nonclassicalities of various initial oscillator Fock states, quantified by the volume of negative regions in the associated Wigner functions, evolve under the MPJC Hamiltonian, considering diverse system parameters including environmental effects. Besides producing substantial enhancements in the initial value for higher photon number states, our analysis reveals that driven solely by the initial qubit energy, with both oscillators initialized in the vacuum state, the nonlinear MPJC interaction yields a significant amount of nontrivial Wigner negativity in the oscillators. The additional nonlinearity introduced by the multiphoton process plays a pivotal role in surpassing the initial nonclassicalities of the photon number states.</p>

The two-chamber silicon and glass cell contains $^{87}$Rb and 1.3 amagat of N$_{2}$ buffer gas, and is placed within a planar optical resonator formed by two mirrors with dichroic dielectric coatings to resonantly enhance the coupling to phase-modulated probe light near the D$_2$ line at 780 nm. We describe the theory of signal generation in this system, including the spin-dependent complex refractive index, cavity optical transfer functions, and PDH signal response to spin polarization. We observe cavity transmission and PDH signals across $\approx 200$ GHz of detuning around the atomic resonance line. By resonant optical pumping on the 795 nm D$_1$ line, we observe spin-dependent cavity line shifts, in good agreement with theory. We use the saturation of the line shift vs. optical pumping power to calibrate the number density and efficiency of the optical pumping. In the unresolved sideband regime, we observe quantum-noise-limited PDH readout of the spin polarization density, with a flat noise floor of $9 \times 10^9$ spins cm$^{-3}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for frequencies above 700 Hz. We note possible extensions of the technique.</p>

Diamagnetic levitation is one of the key techniques for trapping, cooling, and creating a macroscopic quantum spatial superposition in many experiments. It is widely applied in many theoretical and experimental endeavors to test fundamental physics in matter-wave interferometers. To estimate the decoherence rate originating from magnetic-field fluctuations, we use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that our resulting decoherence rate expression is analogous to that of dielectric material in the presence of vacuum fluctuations due to the electric background field component; however, it is often relatively suppressed due to the material properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Song Cao, YanXia Liu, Ding-Fang Zeng</p>
            <p>Investigations show that a time-varying $\delta-\delta'$ mirror gives rise to asymmetrical vacuum radiation on its two sides, enabling one to extract propelling forces from the vacuum fluctuation. In this work, we propose a design of Casimir device to gain propulsions out of vacuum with conventional $\delta$ mirrors. We call this device a ``vacuum propellion'', which is experimentally feasible. It consists of a cavity made up of a perfectly reflective left mirror and a right mirror with time dependent transparency. All particles generated from this propellion are preferentially right-moving, so the cavity obtains a left-pointing propelling force.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence time of the ground state spin of $V_{B}$ centers in hexagonal boron nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Tarighi Tabesh, Saleh Rahimi-Keshari, Mehdi Abdi</p>
            <p>The ground-state spin of optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) offers a promising platform for quantum information applications, such as qubits for quantum computing and nanoscale sensing. A key characteristic of a qubit is its decoherence time, as its duration and controllability are critical for practical applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the electron spin decoherence time of the negatively charged boron vacancies, $V_{B}$ centers, in the hBN lattice by considering the dipolar hyperfine as well as spin-phonon interactions. We employ an approximate method based on the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to take into account a large number of nuclear spins and Debye model to consider the effect of lattice phonons. We show that, in the presence of the dipolar hyperfine interactions, Hahn-echo coherence time of the $V_{B}$ electron spin is approximately $30\: \mathrm{\mu s}$ at room temperature, close to the previously reported results. Our findings suggest that the major source of decoherence is the noise caused by nuclear spins in the lattice. Our results provide a step forward in understanding the $V_{B}$ defect decoherence in the hBN, which might be used for quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Interfacing superconducting nanowire single photon detectors with cryogenic opto-electronics for quantum photonic applications</h2>

            <p>Interfacing single-photon detectors with active photonic components is a cornerstone photonic quantum technology. We describe how the output signal of commercial superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors can be used in situ to drive photonic components such as lasers and electro-optic modulators, co-located in the cryostat. This is enabled by developing custom circuitry using cryogenic-compatible discrete components in the SiGe-BiCMOS platform. We have demonstrated this with a number of experiments, in particular optical readout of an SNSPD and low-latency feed-forward modulation based on single-photon measurement events, all at or below 4 K. This manuscript is an abridged version of the Master thesis of the primary author N. Lamberty.</p>

            <p>Temporal Ghost Imaging (TGI), which reconstructs fast temporal signals using a slow detector, holds significant potential in optical communication, high-speed imaging, and quantum information processing. However, achieving high-quality information reconstruction has been a major challenge for the practical application of TGI. A theoretical model [\emph{ Applied Optics}, 62(5): 1175-1182 (2023)] was proposed to investigate the influence of experimental parameters of the slow detector on image quality; however, its experimental verification was hitherto lacking. In this study, we implemented a multi-bit information transmission scheme based on both quantum and classical TGI methods. Experimental validation confirmed the accuracy of the theoretical model and demonstrated its application in encrypting noisy multi-bit information. The experimental results demonstrate that as the information coding density increases, the decoding accuracy becomes highly sensitive to the detection accuracy and threshold of the slow detector. When these parameters degrade, the decoding quality deteriorates significantly. Additionally, our system shows notable robustness against detection noise, but loses the ability to accurately decode when the noise amplitude becomes too high. Our work endows TGI with optical information encryption capabilities in practical systems and furnishes comprehensive guidelines for the further application of TGI.</p>

            <h2>Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma C. King, Moritz Linnebacher, Peter P. Orth, Matteo Rizzi, Giovanna Morigi</p>
            <p>A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d>4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0<\alpha<3d/2$. For $\alpha<d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d<\alpha<d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s>4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Rongtao Wang, Jiaxin Pan</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>Quantum fluctuations can disrupt long-range order in one-dimensional systems, and replace it with the universal paradigm of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), a critical phase of matter characterized by power-law decaying correlations and linearly dispersing excitations. Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Noise Suppression in Non-Hermitian Resonators at Exceptional Point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitrii N. Maksimov, Andrey A. Bogdanov</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of quantum noise on non-Hermitian resonators at an exceptional point (EP). The system's irreversible Markovian dynamics is modeled using the Lindblad master equation, which accounts for the incoherent pump, radiative losses, and external monochromatic field. An exact analytic solution is derived in the form of the characteristic function of the Husimi distribution, enabling the calculation of all quantum mechanical observables associated with the bosonic degrees of freedom. Our analysis reveals that quantum noise strongly influences the system's response when the system exhibits $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry. Out of the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric regime, however, the system demonstrates stability within a specific parametric domain, where the effects of quantum noise on the signal-to-noise ratio can be mitigated by increasing the external field.</p>

            <p>Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional quantum systems are a valuable resource for quantum information processing. They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variable states in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. For example, high-dimensional systems can be used to realise `Schr√∂dinger cat' states, superpositions of widely displaced coherent states that can also be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales. Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, finite-dimensional systems that can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schrodinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and constitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in the Schrodinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare and control nonclassical resource states, a prerequisite for applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform.</p>

            <p>We present the design and experimental characterization of a kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifier (KI-TWPA) for sub-GHz frequencies. KI-TWPAs amplify signals through nonlinear mixing processes supported by the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting transmission line. The device described here utilizes a compactly meandered TiN microstrip transmission line to achieve the length needed to amplify sub-GHz signals. It is operated in a frequency translating mode where the amplified signal tone is terminated at the output of the amplifier, and the idler tone at approximately 2.5~GHz is brought out of the cryostat. By varying the pump frequency, a gain of up to 22 dB was achieved in a tunable range from about 450 to 850~MHz. Use of TiN as the nonlinear element allows for a reduction of the required pump power by roughly an order of magnitude relative to NbTiN, which has been used for previous KI-TWPA implementations. This amplifier has the potential to enable high-sensitivity and high-speed measurements in a wide range of applications, such as quantum computing, astrophysics, and dark matter detection.</p>

            <h2>High-dimensional entanglement witnessed by correlations in arbitrary bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicky Kai Hong Li, Marcus Huber, Nicolai Friis</p>
            <p>Certifying entanglement is an important step in the development of many quantum technologies, especially for higher-dimensional systems, where entanglement promises increased capabilities for quantum communication and computation. A key feature distinguishing entanglement from classical correlations is the occurrence of correlations for complementary measurement bases. In particular, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a paradigmatic example that is well-understood and routinely employed for entanglement certification. However, implementing unbiased measurements exactly is challenging and not generically possible for all physical platforms. Here, we extend the entanglement-certification toolbox from correlations in MUBs to arbitrary bases. This practically significant simplification paves the way for efficient characterizations of high-dimensional entanglement in a wide range of physical systems. Furthermore, we introduce a simple three-MUBs construction for all dimensions without using the Wootters-Fields construction, potentially simplifying experimental requirements when measurements in more than two MUBs are needed, especially in high-dimensional settings.</p>

            <p>We describe a quantum perturbative approach to evaluating the phase shift of an atom interferometer in a weakly anharmonic trap. This provides a simple way to evaluate quantum corrections to the standard semi-classical approximation. The calculation benefits from the use of generalized coherent states for a basis. We find that the form of the semi-classical approximation remains valid to first order in the anharmonic perturbation, but that phase differences arise because the trajectory of a quantum wave packet will generally deviate from that of a classical particle. The quantum correction to the phase is a factor $\ell^2/A^2$ smaller than the semi-classical perturbation itself, where $\ell$ is the quantum harmonic oscillator length scale and $A$ is the classical amplitude of the motion. We provide analytical results for one-dimensional perturbations of power three through six in the position coordinate.</p>

            <p>We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Sun, Pengfei Zhang, Lei Feng</p>
            <p>Symmetry breaking plays a central role in classifying the phases of quantum many-body systems. Recent developments have highlighted a novel symmetry-breaking pattern, in which the strong symmetry of a density matrix spontaneously breaks to the week symmetry. This strong-to-weak symmetry breaking is typically detected using multi-replica correlation functions, such as the R√©nyi-2 correlator. In this letter, we propose a practical protocol for detecting strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in experiments using the randomized measurement toolbox. Our scheme involves collecting the results of random Pauli measurements for (i) the original quantum state and (ii) the quantum state after evolution with the charged operators. Based on the measurement results, with a large number of samples, we can obtain the exact solution to the R√©nyi-2 correlator. With a small sample size, we can still provide an alternative approach to estimate the phase boundary to a decent accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of Ising chains with all-to-all decoherence as an exemplary demonstration. Our result opens the opportunity for the experimental studies of the novel quantum phases in mixed quantum states.</p>

            <p>Quantum-inspired classical algorithms has received much attention due to its exponential speedup compared to existing algorithms, under certain data storage assumptions. The improvements are noticeable in fundamental linear algebra tasks. In this work, we analyze two major subroutines in sampling-based quantum-inspired algorithms, specifically, inner product estimation and sampling from a linear combination of vectors, and discuss their possible improvements by generalizing the data structure. The idea is to consider the average behavior of the subroutines under certain assumptions regarding the data elements. This allows us to determine the optimal data structure, and the high-dimensional nature of data makes our assumptions reasonable. Experimental results from recommendation systems also highlight a consistent preference for our proposed data structure. Motivated by this observation, we tighten the upper bound on the number of required measurements for direct fidelity estimation. We expect our findings to suggest optimal implementations for various quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms that involve extremely high-dimensional operations, which has potential for many applications.</p>

            <p>A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.</p>

            <p>Driven quantum materials often feature emergent topology, otherwise absent in static crystals. Dynamic bulk-boundary correspondence, encoded by nondissipative gapless modes residing near the Floquet zone center and/or boundaries, is its most prominent example. Here we show that topologically robust gapless dispersive modes appear along the grain boundaries, embedded in the interior of Floquet topological crystals, when the Floquet-Bloch band inversion occurring at a finite momentum (${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv}$) and the Burgers vector (${\bf b}$) of the constituting array of dislocations satisfy ${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv} \cdot {\bf b}=\pi$ (modulo $2 \pi$). Such nondissipative gapless states can be found near the center and/or edges of the Floquet Brillouin zone, irrespective of the drive protocol. We showcase these general outcomes for two-dimensional driven time-reversal symmetry breaking insulators. Promising experimental platforms hosting such dynamic topological dispersive bands in real materials are discussed.</p>

            <p>We employ matrix product states (MPS) and tensor networks to study topological properties of the space of ground states of gapped many-body systems. We focus on families of states in one spatial dimension, where each state can be represented as an injective MPS of finite bond dimension. Such states are short-range entangled ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. To such parametrized families over $X$ we associate a gerbe, which generalizes the line bundle of ground states in zero-dimensional families (\emph{i.e.} in few-body quantum mechanics). The nontriviality of the gerbe is measured by a class in $H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$, which is believed to classify one-dimensional parametrized systems. We show that when the gerbe is nontrivial, there is an obstruction to representing the family of ground states with an MPS tensor that is continuous everywhere on $X$. We illustrate our construction with two examples of nontrivial parametrized systems over $X=S^3$ and $X = \mathbb{R} P^2 \times S^1$. Finally, we sketch using tensor network methods how the construction extends to higher dimensional parametrized systems, with an example of a two-dimensional parametrized system that gives rise to a nontrivial 2-gerbe over $X = S^4$.</p>

For the small systems considered, we observe `thermalization' of both flavor and momentum degrees of freedom on comparable time scales, with results converging towards expectation values computed within a microcanonical ensemble.

            <p>We present a novel scheme for modelling quantum plasmas in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime via a hybrid smoothed particle hydrodynamic - molecular dynamic treatment, here referred to as 'Bohm SPH'. This treatment is founded upon Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics for partially degenerate fluids, does not apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and is computationally tractable, capable of modelling dynamics over ionic timescales at electronic time resolution. Bohm SPH is also capable of modelling non-Gaussian electron wavefunctions. We present an overview of our methodology, validation tests of the single particle case including the hydrogen 1s wavefunction, and comparisons to simulations of a warm dense hydrogen system performed with wave packet molecular dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Transition due to particle losses in a monitored fermionic chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael D. Soares, Youenn Le Gal, Marco Schir√≤</p>
            <p>Recently, there has been interest in the dynamics of monitored quantum systems using linear jump operators related to the creation or annihilation of particles. Here, we study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy under quantum jumps that induce local particle losses in a model of free fermions with hopping and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ pairing. We solve the non-unitary dynamics using the recently developed Faber Polynomial method and explore the different steady-state entanglement regimes by tuning the pairing strength, thus interpolating between monitored free fermions coherently driven by a particle number conserving Hamiltonian to a parity conserving one. In the absence of pairing, all quantum trajectories approach the vacuum at long times, with the entanglement entropy showing non-monotonic behavior over time that we capture with a phenomenological quasiparticle \emph{ansatz}. In this regime, quantum jumps play a key role, and we highlight this by exactly computing their waiting-time distribution. On the other hand, the interplay between losses and pairing gives rise to quantum trajectories with entangled steady-states. We show that by tuning the system parameters, a measurement-induced entanglement transition occurs where the entanglement entropy scaling changes from logarithmic to area-law. We compare this transition with the one derived in the no-click limit and observe qualitative agreement in most of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the statistics of entanglement gain and loss are analyzed to better understand the impact of the linear jump operators.</p>

            <h2>FragPT2: Multi-Fragment Wavefunction Embedding with Perturbative Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emiel Koridon, Souloke Sen, Lucas Visscher, Stefano Polla</p>
            <p>Embedding techniques allow the efficient description of correlations within localized fragments of large molecular systems, while accounting for their environment at a lower level of theory. We introduce FragPT2: a novel embedding framework that addresses multiple interacting active fragments. Fragments are assigned separate active spaces, constructed by localizing canonical molecular orbitals. Each fragment is then solved with a multi-reference method, self-consistently embedded in the mean field from other fragments. Finally, inter-fragment correlations are reintroduced through multi-reference perturbation theory. Our framework provides an exhaustive classification of inter-fragment interaction terms, offering a tool to analyze the relative importance of various processes such as dispersion, charge transfer, and spin exchange. We benchmark FragPT2 on challenging test systems, including \ce{N_2} dimers, multiple aromatic dimers, and butadiene. We demonstrate that our method can be succesful even for fragments defined by cutting through a covalent bond.</p>

            <h2>Phase time and Ehrenfest's theorem in relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Chataignier</p>
            <p>We revisit the concept of phase time, which has been previously proposed as a solution to the problem of time in quantum gravity. Concretely, we show how the geometry of configuration space together with the phase of the wave function of the universe can, under certain conditions, lead to the definition of a positive-definite squared norm from which probabilities can be defined. The norm is conserved under time evolution, and we obtain a version of Ehrenfest's theorem that is analogous to the one in ordinary quantum mechanics. We address how the present approach avoids some difficulties that were encountered in previous attempts at defining an Ehrenfest theorem relative to phase time in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity, and how it is connected to a notion of gauge fixing the inner product. We conclude with a brief outlook.</p>

The number $N_g$ of gravitons can be large enough for the stochastic gravitational noise produced by them to displace a massive test particle in a physical system, allowing for the detection of gravitons. Possible experiments to detect gravitons are proposed involving collective stochastic fluctuations due to a large number of gravitons, causing a Brownian motion displacement of a massive test body. Gravitational wave experiments involving advanced interferometer techniques and mirrors could detect the large collective number of gravitons, and could detect Brownian motion of test particles in the detectors' component mirrors.

            <p>We show that the conventional Jarzynski equality does not hold for a system prepared in a microcanonical ensemble. We derive a modified equality that connects microcanonical work fluctuations to entropy production, in an analogous way to the Jarzynski equality, but with reference to an inverse temperature that depends on the path of the work protocol. For close to isothermal processes the modified equality can improve on the bound $\langle W\rangle\ge \Delta F$. Our result is a special case of a general expression for the microcanonical moment-generating function for any extensive quantity, which enables calculation of the breakdown of ensemble equivalence for thermodynamic fluctuations. We demonstrate our microcanonical Jarzynski equality in a system of driven two-level spins.</p>

We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be tuned to a maximum. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Quantum-Classical Systems in Nonequilibrium Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeremy Schofield, Raymond Kapral</p>
            <p>The dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a classical environment and subject to constraints that drive it out of equilibrium is described. The evolution of the system is governed by the quantum-classical Liouville equation. Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum-classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a dilute solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guus Avis, Stefan Krastanov</p>
            <p>Quantum repeaters are envisioned to enable long-distance entanglement distribution. Analysis of quantum-repeater networks could hasten their realization by informing design decisions and research priorities. Determining derivatives of network properties is crucial towards that end, facilitating optimizations and revealing parameter sensitivity. Doing so, however, is difficult because the networks are discretely random. Here we use a recently developed technique, stochastic automatic differentiation, to automatically extract derivatives from discrete Monte Carlo simulations of repeater networks. With these derivatives, we optimize rate-fidelity tradeoffs in a repeater chain, determine the chain's sensitivity with respect to the coherence times of different nodes, and finally choose the locations of quantum repeaters in a two-dimensional plane to optimize the guaranteed quality of service between four end nodes. In particular, the technique enabled us to discover how the best achievable quality of service, the minimal number of repeaters required to improve a network, and the number of repeaters required to saturate the network scale with the physical size of the network.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement and Measurement Noise: A Novel Approach to Satellite Node Authentication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pooria Madani, Carolyn McGregor</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a novel authentication scheme for satellite nodes based on quantum entanglement and measurement noise profiles. Our approach leverages the unique noise characteristics exhibited by each satellite's quantum optical communication system to create a distinctive "quantum noise fingerprint." This fingerprint is used for node authentication within a satellite constellation, offering a quantum-safe alternative to traditional cryptographic methods. The proposed scheme consists of a training phase, where each satellite engages in a training exercise with its neighbors to compile noise profiles, and an online authentication phase, where these profiles are used for real-time authentication. Our method addresses the inherent challenges of implementing cryptographic-based schemes in space, such as key management and distribution, by exploiting the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics and the unavoidable imperfections in quantum systems. This approach enhances the security and reliability of satellite communication networks, providing a robust solution to the authentication challenges in satellite constellations. We validated and tested several hypotheses for this approach using IBM System One quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ebubechukwu O. Ilo-Okeke, Tongzhou Wang, Valentin Ivannikov, Tim Byrnes</p>
            <p>We propose a method to deterministically entangle qubits or ensembles of qubits interacting with a shared bosonic mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that the resulting gate is a product of two unitaries: one unitary acts only on the quantum state of the qubits and entangles them, while the other acts only on the quantum state of the boson, producing a phase shift. We find that the gate time is inversely proportional to the qubit-boson interaction strength, and by tuning the qubit-boson interaction strength, one can prepare a maximally entangled state or a squeezed state. Applying the quantum gate to multiple qubit ensembles, we show that the quantum gate prepares a Schr√∂dinger cat state. We also examine imperfections such as including free evolution of the qubits, and show that this produces an effective mixing. Our proposal is feasible for ultrastrong coupling experiments.</p>

            <h2>The quantum enigma of teleportation near black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijit Mandal, Sovik Roy</p>
            <p>The enigma surrounding the existence of black holes has recently been substantiated through the groundbreaking work of experimental physicists \cite{genzel2024}. Exploring quantum systems under the gravitational influence of black holes has emerged as a pivotal area of research. Among the frontier works in quantum information processing is the utilization of quantum states as quantum channels. A fundamental quantum information protocol is teleportation, in which two parties, Alice and Bob, share entangled states. In this protocol, the sender, Alice, who holds an unknown qubit, utilizes local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to recreate the qubit at the recipient's (Bob's) end. Notably, during the execution of this protocol, Alice loses the unknown qubit on her side. The teleportation protocol, originally proposed by Bennett et al. \cite{bennett1993}, has been extensively studied with various states and under different physical setups. Researchers have explored both modifications to the protocol itself and the viability of various quantum states as teleportation channels. In this paper, we investigate whether bipartite mixed states derived from two inequivalent classes of tripartite pure states, subjected to the gravitational influence of two different black hole models, can still serve as efficient quantum channels for teleportation. We emphasize the teleportation fidelity of these states, a critical factor for determining their efficacy as quantum channels. Specifically, the fidelity must exceed the classical limit of $\frac{2}{3}$ to be considered effective \cite{pop1994}. We conjecture that, even under the gravitational influence of black holes, the quantum characteristics of the given states are preserved, enabling them to function effectively as quantum channels for teleportation.</p>

            <h2>Gaussian R\'enyi-2 correlations in a nondegenerate three-level laser</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamal El Qars</p>
            <p>Quantum correlation is a key component in various quantum information processing tasks. Decoherence process imposes limitations on achieving these quantum tasks. Therefore, understanding the behavior of quantum correlations in dissipative-noisy systems is of paramount importance. Here, on the basis of the Gaussian R√©nyi-2 entropy, we analyze entanglement and quantum discord in a two-mode Gaussian state $\rho_{AB}$. The mode $A$($B$) is generated within the first(second) transition of a nondegenerate three-level cascade laser. Using realistic experimental parameters, we show that both entanglement and discord could be generated and enhanced by inducing more quantum coherence. Under thermal noise, entanglement is found more fragile having a tendency to disappear rapidly. While, quantum discord exhibits a freezing behavior, where it can be captured within a wide range of temperature. Surprisingly, we find that entanglement can exceed quantum discord in contrary to the expectation based on the assumption that the former is only a part of the later. Finally, we show numerically as well as analytically that optimal quantum discord can be captured by performing Gaussian measurements on mode $B$. The obtained results suggest that nondegenerate three-level lasers may be a valuable resource for some quantum information tasks, especially, for those do not require entanglement.</p>

            <p>The natural lineshape of an excited two-level atom (TLA) has long been known to be gauge-dependent, with certain experiments in better agreement with the lineshape calculated with the dipole gauge. We show that by using a Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian truncated in a manner consistent with the gauge principle, the correct output spectrum can be obtained. For TLAs undergoing dynamics arising from additional Hamiltonian couplings, we also show that the master equation is gauge-invariant under the same conditions of validity as the Born-Markov approximation, despite different gauges having different spectral densities. These results highlight the importance of using correctly truncated gauge-invariant Hamiltonians in input-output theory for accurate frequency-dependent spectra, even in weak coupling regimes.</p>

Here, we present the experimental realization of a $\pi$-flux rhombic system using a two-dimensional superconducting qubit array with tunable coupling. We experimentally observe characteristic dynamics, e.g., $\pi$-flux driven destructive interference, and demonstrate the protocol for eigenstate preparation in this rhombic array with coupler-assisted flux.

            <p>Developing a dark matter detector with wide mass tunability is an immensely desirable property, yet it is challenging due to maintaining strong sensitivity. Resonant cavities for dark matter detection have traditionally employed mechanical tuning, moving parts around to change electromagnetic boundary conditions. However, these cavities have proven challenging to operate in sub-Kelvin cryogenic environments due to differential thermal contraction, low heat capacities, and low thermal conductivities. Instead, we develop an electronically tunable cavity architecture by coupling a superconducting 3D microwave cavity with a DC flux tunable SQUID. With a flux delivery system engineered to maintain high coherence in the cavity, we perform a hidden-photon dark matter search below the quantum-limited threshold. A microwave photon counting technique is employed through repeated quantum non-demolition measurements using a transmon qubit. With this device, we perform a hidden-photon search with a dark count rate of around 64 counts/s and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to ${\varepsilon}< 4\times 10^{-13}$ in a tunable band from 5.672 GHz to 5.694 GHz. By coupling multimode tunable cavities to the transmon, wider hidden-photon searching ranges are possible.</p>

The resource manager models quantum chips into different abstract layers, including the real quantum processing unit (QPU), the standard QPU (StdQPU), the substructure QPU (SubQPU), and the virtual QPU (VQPU), and stores this information in a quantum computing resource virtualization database, thus realizing the unified management of quantum computing devices. The quantum compiler adopts a modular and extensible design, providing a flexible framework for customizing compilation optimization strategies. It provides hardware-aware compilation algorithms that account for quantum gate noise and qubit coupling structures. By selecting the most suitable computing resources from the VQPU library, the compiler maps quantum tasks to the optimal qubit regions of the target device. We validated the effectiveness of the QSteed on the superconducting devices of the Quafu quantum cloud computing cluster.

            <p>To simulate the real- and imaginary-time evolution of a many-electron system on a quantum computer based on the first-quantized formalism, we need to encode molecular orbitals (MOs) into qubit states for typical initial-state preparation.

We employ the discrete Lorentzian functions (LFs) as a fitting basis set, for which we maximize the fidelity to find the optimal Tucker-form state to represent a target MO. For $n_{\mathrm{prod}}$ three-dimensional LFs, we provide the explicit circuit construction for the state preparation involving $\mathcal{O} (n_{\mathrm{prod}})$ CNOT gates. Furthermore, we introduce a tensor decomposition technique to construct a canonical-form state to approximate the Tucker-form state with controllable accuracy. Rank-$R$ decomposition reduces the CNOT gate count to $\mathcal{O} (R n_{\mathrm{prod}}^{1/3}).$ We demonstrate via numerical simulations that the proposed scheme is a powerful tool for encoding MOs of various quantum chemical systems, paving the way for first-quantized calculations using hundreds or more logical qubits.</p>

            <p>To stabilize the working temperature of an equipment, a solid-state thermal resistor is usually a requisite, which could adjust its heat conductance continuously according to the temperature. In this work, the thermal conductivity and the thermal switching performances of surface plasmon polaritons in the polymer films filled with Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) were theoretically analyzed, and a theoretical model was also derived to reveal the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the temperature and the structure of a composite film, which is verified to be effective by numerical calculations. It shows that the thermal conductivity will decrease following ~t-3exp({\zeta}/Td) rule under the thin film limit, here t, d and T are film thickness, diameter of QDs and temperature, respectively, and {\zeta} is a constant. A high thermal conductivity could be only realized at a device with a size lager than millimeter scale, due to the need of avoiding boundary scatterings of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). At the millimeter scale, the thermal conductivity could be reduced by 100 times by increasing temperature from 300 to 400 K, which suggests a very high thermal switching ratio almost in all kinds of solid-state thermal resistor. This study brings new insights in designing thermal resistor and understanding heat conduction in films by adjusting its structures.</p>

            <p>The theory of quantum information processing for macroscopic qubits is based on the fact that every macroscopic qubit has a conserved number of particles. However, from an experimental point of view, every such qubit experiences processes of decoherence that impact the possibilities for entanglement generation between such qubits and use in quantum information processing efficiently. One of the most prospective methods for generating entanglement between distant atomic BECs is quantum nondemolition measurements. Here, we study how the effects of photon measurement impact the entanglement when photon loss decoherence is included. We employ the thermally entangled state representation (TESR) and integral within the ordered operator(IWOP) approach to obtain the accurate density matrix in a photon loss channel. We demonstrate that varying outcomes of photon number measurements lead to the generation of distinct entangled states, each exhibiting unique characteristics. We find that using the Hofmann-Takeuchi and Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criterion provides advantages in entanglement detection compared to the Wineland squeezing and EPR steering criterion in such settings.</p>

Here, we introduce a critical sensing scheme that mitigate critical slowing down by leveraging the non-equilibrium dynamics of a perturbed Ising spin model, coupled with an adaptive strategy to enlarge its sensing interval. We validate the proposed scheme on a superconducting quantum processor and demonstrate that our scheme achieves a Heisenberg scaling with respect to the encoding duration. Additionally, the adaptive strategy tunes the model to operate near its critical point with limited prior information about the parameter, enabling what is known as global sensing. Our work showcases the metrological applications empowered by non-equilibrium critical dynamics and hence opens up a pathway for devising critical quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Wang, Xiantao Li</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM), conceived as an error suppression paradigm without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose non-Markovian Noise Mitigation (NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions (BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on the spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</p>

            <h2>A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas J. Sorensen, Vitaliy Sultanov, Maria V. Chekhova</p>
            <p>The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.</p>

In this work, we introduce several advances to electronic structure calculation for molecular systems, resulting in a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup of estimated runtimes over prior-art algorithms run on comparable quantum devices. One of these advances is a novel framework for block-invariant symmetry-shifted Tensor Hypercontraction (BLISS-THC), with which we achieve the tightest Hamiltonian factorizations reported to date. We compile our algorithm for an Active Volume (AV) architecture, a technical layout that has recently been proposed for fusion-based photonic quantum hardware. AV compilation contributes towards a lower runtime of our computation by eliminating overheads stemming from connectivity issues in the underlying surface code. We present a detailed benchmark of our approach, focusing primarily on the computationally challenging benchmark molecule P450.

            <h2>Teleportation and Entanglement Swapping of Continuous Quantum Variables of Microwave Radiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baleegh Abdo, William Shanks, Oblesh Jinka, J. R. Rozen, Jason Orcutt</p>
            <p>Quantum communication is needed to build powerful quantum computers and establish reliable quantum networks. At its basis lies the ability to generate and distribute entanglement to separate quantum systems, which can be used to run remote quantum operations on them or teleport quantum states from one system to another with the help of classical channels. To this end, it is useful to harness the resource of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement since it can be efficiently and unconditionally produced by squeezing light in a nonlinear medium and can be easily manipulated, distributed, and measured using standard components. While various aspects of CV-based quantum communication have been successfully demonstrated in the optical domain, some key capabilities, such as entanglement swapping, have been lacking in the microwave domain. Here, we demonstrate three key elements of CV-based microwave quantum communication, (1) a Josephson mixer operating as nondegenerate two-mode entangler with maximum measured logarithmic negativity E_N=1.5, (2) a quantum teleportation apparatus, capable of teleporting vacuum and coherent states with a maximum fidelity of 73%, which exceeds the 50% classical limit and is mainly limited by intermediate losses in the setup, and (3) an entanglement swapping system which generates entanglement between two remote noninteracting modes via entanglement swapping operations applied to input vacuum and coherent states with maximum measured logarithmic negativity E_N=0.53. Such hardware-efficient CV entanglement building blocks that are based on nondegenerate Josephson mixers could enable wide-ranging applications in modular quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.</p>

            <p>The quantum dynamics of a compound sample consisting from a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) system non-linearly coupled with a leaking single-mode micro-resonator is theoretically investigated. The focus is on the resonance condition when the transition frequency of the double quantum dot equals to the doubled resonator frequency, respectively, and the resulting interplay among the involved phonon or photon channels. As a result, the steady-state quantum dynamics of this complex non-linear system exhibits a variety of possible effects that have been demonstrated here. Particularly, we have found the relationship among the electrical current through the double quantum dot and the microwave field inside the resonator that is nonlinearly coupled to it, with a corresponding emphasizing on their critical behaviors. Additionally, the quantum correlations of the photon flux generated into the resonator mode vary from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics, leading to single-qubit lasing phenomena at microwave frequencies.</p>

            <p>We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T > 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Wang, Maxine Luo, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</p>

            <p>Synchronizing clocks to measure time is a fundamental process underpinning every practical communication task from GPS to parallel computation. However, as the current protocols are based on classical communication between the sender and receiver, they are prone to simple attacks that could cause a slight delay in the signal which would then cause a massive error in further operations. In this work, we first explain a simple attack that in principle can cause an arbitrary delay in the signal between sender and receiver. We then propose a way to overcome this problem by using a recently contrived idea of device-independent certification which utilises quantum nonlocality. Consequently, clocks can be synchronized in a highly secure way without trusting any devices in the setup. We then extend this proposal to observe relativistic time dilation in a device-independent manner.</p>

            <p>Stress can increase the possibility of cognitive impairment and decrease the quality of life in older adults. Smart healthcare can deploy quantum machine learning to enable preventive and diagnostic support. This work introduces a unique technique to address stress detection as an anomaly detection problem that uses quantum hybrid support vector machines. With the help of a wearable smartwatch, we mapped baseline sensor reading as normal data and stressed sensor reading as anomaly data using cortisol concentration as the ground truth. We have used quantum computing techniques to explore the complex feature spaces with kernel-based preprocessing. We illustrate the usefulness of our method by doing experimental validation on 40 older adults with the help of the TSST protocol. Our findings highlight that using a limited number of features, quantum machine learning provides improved accuracy compared to classical methods. We also observed that the recall value using quantum machine learning is higher compared to the classical method. The higher recall value illustrates the potential of quantum machine learning in healthcare, as missing anomalies could result in delayed diagnostics or treatment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M. Alsing, Richard J. Birrittella</p>
            <p>In recent works we have explored a multi-photon extension of the celebrated two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect in which the quantum amplitudes for a two-photon input to a lossless, balanced 50:50 beamsplitter (BS) undergoes complete destructive interference. In the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel (eHOM) effect the multi-photon scattering of photons from the two input ports to the two output ports of the BS for Fock number basis input states (FS) $|n,m\rangle_{12}$ exhibit complete destructive interference pairwise within the quantum amplitudes containing many scattering components, generalizing the two-photon HOM effect. This has profound implications for arbitrary bipartite photonic input states constructed from such basis states: if the input state to one input port of the BS is of odd parity, i.e. constructed from only of odd numbers of photons, then regardless of the input state to the second 50:50 BS port, there will be a central nodal line (CNL) of zeros in the joint output probability distribution along the main diagonal for coincidence detection. The first goal of this present work is to show diagrammatically how the extended HOM effect can be seen as a succession of multi-photon HOM effects when the latter is viewed as a pairwise cancellation of mirror image scattering amplitudes. The second goal of this work is to explore considerations for the experimental realization of the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We examine the case of a single photon interfering with a coherent state (an idealized laser) on a balanced 50:50 beamsplitter and consider prospects for experimental detection of the output destructive interference by including additional effects such as imperfect detection efficiency, spatio-temporal mode functions, and time delay between the detected output photons.</p>

            <p>Synchronization is one of the essential collective behaviors and has extensive applications. Exploiting a common environment, we establish synchronization in microwave optomechanical circuits. Through analysis and numerical calculations, we study the synchronization dynamics of three nonidentical and mechanically isolated optomechanical resonators. Each resonator supports a microwave mode and a mechanical mode, which are coupled via radiation-pressure type optomechanical interaction. The common environment induces indirect coupling between any two resonators, which can be described by an effective non-Hermitian interaction Hamiltonian. Combined with the Hermitian interaction regulated by the tunable coupler, we demonstrate that the common environment breaks the reciprocity of the interaction. We propose several special microwave optomechanical circuits with nonreciprocal or even unidirectional interactions, and study the regulation of synchronization dynamics by the common environment. By utilizing the excellent tunability of superconducting circuits, we show that different synchronization states can be switched in a controllable way. This work may open up a new way for synchronization research and have potential applications in synchronization networks.</p>

This scheme can be readily extended to a three-giant-atom system for generating W states. In both the two- and three-atom setups, the maximally entangled states are generated in a short time and remain stable even as time approaches infinity. Our proposal is feasible for implementation on state-of-the-art solid-state quantum platforms and significantly broadens the applications of giant atoms and waveguide QED system in quantum information processing.</p>

Since the standard Coulomb potential is a simple but fundamental solution of Maxwell's equations, hence Maxwell's equations can predict the existence of the standard Coulomb potential. The Yang-Mills equations are the natural generalizations of Maxwell's equations from the Abelian potentials to the non-Abelian ones, thus based on the Yang-Mills equations, one can predict the reasonable form of spin-dependent Coulomb potential, which naturally reduces the standard Coulomb potential if without considering the spin.

            <p>Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization is a prominent candidate for early fault tolerant quantum simulation of many-body and molecular systems, but so far the focus has been mainly on computing ground-state energies. We go beyond this by deriving analytical first-order derivatives for quantum Krylov methods and show how to obtain relaxed one and two particle reduced density matrices of the Krylov eigenstates. The direct approach to measuring these matrices requires a number of distinct measurement that scales quadratically with the Krylov dimension $D$. Here, we show how to reduce this scaling to a constant. This is done by leveraging quantum signal processing to prepare Krylov eigenstates, including exited states, in depth linear in $D$. We also compare several measurement schemes for efficiently obtaining the expectation value of an operator with states prepared using quantum signal processing. We validate our approach by computing the nuclear gradient of a small molecule and estimating its variance.</p>

            <p>The existence of macroscopic shell structure of submicron metal clusters is known for several decades. Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis for clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by shell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range electrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a hemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons, but not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we demonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the vicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of hemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure evaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale spatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell effects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in various fields of science and technology.</p>

            <p>We consider an experimentalist, Alice, who creates a quantum superposition of a charged or massive body outside of a black hole (or, more generally, in the presence of a Killing horizon). It was previously shown that emission of soft photons/gravitons into the black hole will result in the decoherence of the components of the superposition if it is held open for a sufficiently long span of time. However, at any finite time, $t_c$, during the process, it is not obvious how much decoherence has irrevocably occurred. Equivalently, it is not obvious how much information an observer inside the black hole can extract about Alice's superposition prior to time $t_c$. In this paper, we solve for the optimal experimental protocol to be followed by Alice for $t > t_c$ so as to minimize the decoherence of the components of her superposition. More precisely, given the entangling radiation that has passed through the horizon prior to the cross-section $\mathcal C$ corresponding to the time $t = t_c$ in Alice's lab, we determine the "optimal purification" of this radiation beyond $\mathcal C$ such that the global quantum state of the radiation through the horizon has maximal overlap (quantum fidelity) with the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh vacuum. Due to the intricate low frequency entanglement structure of the quantum field theory vacuum state, we find this optimal purification to be nontrivial. In particular, even if Alice has already "closed" her superposition by bringing the components back together, we find that she can decrease the net decoherence of the components of her superposition somewhat by re-opening it and performing further manipulations.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions in Quasi-Periodically Driven Quantum Critical Systems: Analytical Results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiyuan Fang, Qi Zhou, Xueda Wen</p>
            <p>In this work, we study analytically the phase transitions in quasi-periodically driven one dimensional quantum critical systems that are described by conformal field theories (CFTs). The phase diagrams and phase transitions can be analytically obtained by using Avila's global theory in one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles. Compared to the previous works where the quasiperiodicity was introduced in the driving time and no phase transitions were observed [1], here we propose a setup where the quasiperiodicity is introduced in the driving Hamiltonians. In our setup, one can observe the heating phases, non-heating phases, and the phase transitions. The phase diagram as well as the Lyapunov exponents that determine the entanglement entropy evolution can be analytically obtained. In addition, based on Avila's theory, we prove there is no phase transition in the previously proposed setup of quasi-periodically driven CFTs [1]. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of entanglement entropy on lattice models.</p>

            <h2>Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artuur Stevens, Christophe Caloz</p>
            <p>We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schr√∂dinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is $25\%$, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of $84\%$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schr√∂dinger equation.</p>

            <p>Studying the immunity of topological superconductors against non-local disorder is one of the key issues in both fundamental researches and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate that the non-Hermiticity can enhance the robustness of topological edge states against non-local disorder. To illustrate that, we consider a one-dimensional (1D) generalized Kitaev model with the asymmetric hopping in the presence of disorder. It is shown that the region supporting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) against non-local disorder will be enlarged by the non-Hermiticity. Through both the numerical and analytical analyses, we show that non-Hermiticity can stabilize the topological superconducting (SC) phase against higher disorder strength. Our studies would offer new insights into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology.</p>

            <h2>Kerr-magnon-assisted asymptotic stationary photon-phonon squeezing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-fan Qi, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states in continuous variable systems, which have broad applications in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a photon-phonon squeezing protocol assisted by a Kerr magnon within a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. We construct an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for photon-phonon squeezing through strong photon-magnon interaction and modulation over the driving on the photon mode. The effective Hamiltonian can be confirmed by the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian and quantum Langevin equation, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation. Our finding indicates that the asymptotic stationary squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even when the covariance matrix of the system still varies with time. This squeezing level can exceed the maximum value under stable conditions. Moreover, our analysis reveals that a proper Kerr nonlinearity of the magnon can further promote the squeezing generation. Our work provides an extendable framework for generating squeezed states of two Gaussian modes with indirect coupling.</p>

            <p>Solving linear systems of equations plays a fundamental role in numerous computational problems from different fields of science. The widespread use of numerical methods to solve these systems motivates investigating the feasibility of solving linear systems problems using quantum computers. In this work, we provide a survey of the main advances in quantum linear systems algorithms, together with some applications. We summarize and analyze the main ideas behind some of the algorithms for the quantum linear systems problem in the literature. The analysis begins by examining the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) solver. We note its limitations and reliance on computationally expensive quantum methods, then highlight subsequent research efforts which aimed to address these limitations and optimize runtime efficiency and precision via various paradigms. We focus in particular on the post-HHL enhancements which have paved the way towards optimal lower bounds with respect to error tolerance and condition number. By doing so, we propose a taxonomy that categorizes these studies. Furthermore, by contextualizing these developments within the broader landscape of quantum computing, we explore the foundational work that have inspired and informed their development, as well as subsequent refinements. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of these algorithms in differential equations, quantum machine learning, and many-body physics.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Evaluation of Optical Quantum Modules via Two-Photon High-Dimensional Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoqian Zhang, Maolin Luo, Xiaoqi Zhou</p>
            <p>The rapid advancement of quantum information technology has increased the demand for precise testing and calibration of quantum modules, especially in optical quantum circuits where module reliability directly impacts system performance. To address this need, we propose a two-photon quantum module evaluation method based on high-dimensional Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. Our method uses multi-degree-of-freedom photon encoding to enable rapid and accurate evaluation of optical quantum modules. Compared to traditional methods such as quantum process tomography and direct fidelity estimation, our method not only simplifies implementation but also significantly minimizes the measurement resources required. Notably, the resource demands remain invariant as the system dimensionality scales, ensuring efficient evaluation even in high-dimensional quantum systems. We validated this method on a programmable silicon photonic chip, demonstrating its ability to accurately evaluate optical quantum module performance while significantly reducing resource consumption. This quantum module evaluation method holds promise for broader applications in the field of optical quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Wang Zhang, Cheng Shang, J. Y. Sun, Zhuo-Cheng Gu, X. X. Yi</p>
            <p>In recent years, extensive research has been dedicated to the study of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, which involves the engineered balance of gain and loss in non-Hermitian optics. Complementary to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, the concept of anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has emerged as a natural framework for describing the dynamics of open systems with dissipations. In this work, we study spectral transitions and photon transmission in a linear spinning resonator perturbed by nanoparticles. First, we show that by precisely controlling the nanoparticle perturbations, the eigenvalues (or spectra) of a non-Hermitian system satisfying anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can transit to that of a quasi-closed Hermitian system. Second, we outline the essential conditions for constructing a quasi-closed system and analyze its dynamic behavior with respect to photon transmission. By adjusting the rotational angular velocity of the spinning resonator and the strength of the nanoparticle perturbations, the quasi-closed system enables a variety of photon distribution behaviors, which may have significant applications in quantum devices. Our findings offer valuable insights for the design of dissipative quantum devices under realistic conditions and for understanding their responses to external perturbations.</p>

            <p>Large-area quantum networks based on optical fibers allow photons at near-infrared wavelengths to travel with minimal loss. Quantum frequency conversion is a method to alter the wavelength of a single photon while maintaining its quantum state. Most commonly, nonlinear crystals are employed for this conversion process, where near-unity conversion efficiency at high fidelity has been demonstrated. Still, the crystal-based conversion process is plagued by strong background noise, very limited spectral bandwidth, and inhomogeneous temperature profiles at strong pump fields. In previous work, we have demonstrated frequency conversion in hydrogen-filled hollow-core fibers and claimed that this conversion process does not compromise performance at strong pump fields, is essentially free of background noise, and intrinsically broadband. Here, we demonstrate that these three claims are justified.</p>

We also explore the non-monotonic relationship between the violations of Bell inequalities and the amount of entanglement present in this family of mixed states.

            <p>The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrowband parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin-state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feed-forward conditional phase-shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to \SI{500}{\cps}, with a measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead-time of \SI{100}{\micro\second}, leading to an entanglement rate of \SI{22}{\cps} per heralding detector, increased by a factor of 15 thanks to temporal multiplexing. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.</p>

            <h2>Quantum entanglement as an extremal Kirkwood-Dirac nonreality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agung Budiyono</p>
            <p>Understanding the relationship between various different forms of nonclassicality and their resource character is of great importance in quantum foundation and quantum information. Here, we discuss a quantitative link between quantum entanglement and the anomalous/nonclassical nonreal values of Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability, in a bipartite setting. We first construct an entanglement monotone for a pure bipartite state based on the nonreality of the KD quasiprobability defined over a pair of orthonormal bases in which one of them is a product, and optimizations over these bases. It admits a closed expression as a Schur-concave function of the state of the subsystem having a form of nonadditive quantum entropy. We then construct a bipartite entanglement monotone for generic quantum states using the convex roof extension. Its normalized value is upper bounded by the concurrence of formation, and for two-qubit systems, they are equal. We also derive lower and upper bounds in terms of different forms of uncertainty in the subsystem quantified respectively by an extremal trace-norm asymmetry and a nonadditive quantum entropy. The entanglement monotone can be expressed as the minimum total state disturbance due to a nonselective local binary measurement. Finally, we discuss its estimation using weak value measurement and classical optimization, and its connection with strange weak value and quantum contextuality.</p>

            <h2>Optimal qubit-mediated quantum heat transfer via non-commuting operators and strong coupling effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marlon Brenes, Jakub Garwo≈Ça, Dvira Segal</p>
            <p>Heat transfer in quantum systems is a current topic of interest due to emerging quantum technologies that attempt to miniaturize engines and examine fundamental aspects of thermodynamics. In this work, we consider heat transfer between two thermal reservoirs in which a central spin degree of freedom mediates the process. Our objective is to identify the system-bath coupling operators that maximize heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling strengths. By employing a Markovian embedding method in the form of the reaction-coordinate mapping, we study numerically heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling energy and for general system-bath coupling operators between the baths and the central qubit system. We find a stark contrast in the conditions required for optimal heat transfer depending on whether the system is weakly or strongly coupled to the heat baths. In the weak-coupling regime, optimal heat transfer requires identical coupling operators that facilitate maximum sequential transport, resonant with the central qubit. In contrast, in the strong-coupling regime, non-commuting system-bath coupling operators between the hot and cold reservoirs are necessary to achieve optimal heat transfer. We further employ the Effective Hamiltonian theory and gain partial analytical insights on the observed phenomena. We discuss the limitations of this approximate method in capturing the behavior of the heat current for non-commuting coupling operators, calling for its future extensions to capture transport properties in systems with general interaction Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>Neutral Atoms in Optical Tweezers as Messenger Qubits for Scaling up a Trapped Ion Quantum Computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Svetlana Kotochigova, Subhadeep Gupta, Boris Blinov</p>
            <p>We propose to combine neutral atom and trapped ion qubits in one scalable modular architecture that uses shuttling of individual neutral atoms in optical tweezers to realize atomic interconnects between trapped ion quantum registers. These interconnects are deterministic, and thus may be performed on-demand. The proposed protocol is as follows: a tweezer-trapped neutral atom qubit is brought close to a trapped ion in an ion chain serving as a module of a larger quantum computer, and an entangling gate is performed between the two qubits. Then the neutral atom is quickly moved to another, nearby trapped ion chain in the same modular ion trap and entangled with an ion in that chain, thus entangling the two separate ion chains. The optical dipole potential of the tweezer beam for the neutral atom does not measurably affect the trapped ions, while the RF ion trap does not affect the neutral atom. With realistic tweezer trap parameters, the neutral atom can be moved over millimeter scale distance in a few tens of microseconds, thus enabling a remote entanglement generation rate of over 10^3/s even with very modest assumptions for the atom-ion quantum gate speed, and possibly up to 10^4/s, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art with photonic interconnects.</p>

Numerical benchmarking on molecular systems shows that our hybrid quantum-neural wavefunction approach achieves near-chemical accuracy, comparable to advanced quantum and classical techniques.

By repetitively generating entanglement with short-coherence-time qubits and injecting it into QEC-protected logical qubits, our approach effectively preserves entanglement. Through error detection to discard error states and entanglement pumping to mitigate errors within the code space, we extend the lifespan of entangled logical qubits by nearly 50% compared to the case without entanglement pumping.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suchetana Goswami, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>The principal resource in several quantum information processing tasks is entanglement. Building practically useful versions of such tasks, one often needs to consider multipartite systems. And in such scenarios, it is impossible to eliminate the effects of environment while distributing the resources. We show how information back-flow from the environment, as a result of non-Markovianity in the system dynamics, affects the resources in multipartite systems, specifically multiparty entanglement. In particular, we find that entanglement of multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger cat states saturate with time to a non-zero value for a non-Markovian dephasing noise. The multi-qubit W states saturate to a higher value. Such non-zero time-saturated values are washed out if the non-Markovianity in the channel is removed. The multi-qubit W states provide a richer set of features, including a non-zero value for an asymptotic number of qubits and an even-odd dichotomy in entanglement with number of qubits. Moving over to a non-Markovian depolarising channel, we find that both cat and W states exhibit revival of entanglement after collapse.</p>

            <p>We present a novel approach to observing the Purcell effect in a photon-magnon coupled (PMC) hybrid system consisting of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film and a hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) arranged in a planar geometry. This hybrid system has been designed and simulated using the commercial electromagnetic full-wave simulator CST Microwave Studio for various values of damping constant (alpha) of the YIG film while keeping the HRR properties constant. Our results reveal that as the magnon damping increases, the anti-crossing behavior between photon and magnon modes in the transmission spectra diminishes, transitioning the coupled modes into the Purcell regime. This transition is attributed to an enhanced spontaneous emission rate of microwave photons when coupled to lossy magnons, driving the PMC system into the Purcell regime. To elucidate this behavior, we developed a comprehensive theoretical framework based on a quantum model, which accurately describes the observed Purcell phenomena and provides estimations of the PMC strength (g/2pi). Notably, by tuning alpha from 1.4 x 10^-5 to 2.8 x 10^-2, we achieved precise control over (g/2pi) ranging from 63 MHz to 127 MHz. This study highlights the Purcell effect's role in enhancing photon decay rates and establishes a clear relationship with PMC strength. Our work offers a comprehensive method for controlling photon resonance dissipation, opening new avenues for exploring the Purcell effect and its applications in on-chip functional devices leveraging magnon-photon interactions for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P√©rot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</p>

We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. Single domain walls on top of ordered states behave differently from those found in Ising models, featuring strong anisotropy because of the $U(1)$ invariant coupling between light and matter. The non-local nature of the cavity mode is instead affecting meson and string dynamics drastically. Meson hybridizes coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polariton excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy and propagate freely thanks to the non-local interaction between the underlying domain-walls mediated by the cavity mode. We conclude by examining the effect of cavity losses, proposing a state-preparation protocol which actively uses the cavity mode, and presenting a concrete experimental blueprint.</p>

This approach works because it allows arbitrary long-range interactions in the spin model to be mapped on an optical system with only nearest-neighbor physical interactions.</p>

            <h2>Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min Long, Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moir√© materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lafe Spietz, Adam Sirois, Nathan Flowers-Jacobs, Steve Waltman, Samuel Benz, Peter Hopkins</p>
            <p>Radio frequency cryogenic switches are a critical enabling technology for quantum information science for both calibration and high throughput testing of samples. Traditionally, solenoid-based switches have been used [1,2], but a transition is being made to MEMS-based (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) switches due to their lower power dissipation and smaller size, and to minimize the risk that solenoid switches tend to produce current pulses that destroy expensive cryogenic amplifiers and can cause electrostatic damage to devices. These MEMS switches require a 90-volt signal to be applied to the control lines to determine the state of the switches. Switches exist that have built-in CMOS-based (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) control electronics to drive the 90 V, but these do not work at the cryogenic temperatures used in quantum information science. There is no currently available room temperature control system with direct control of the switches. The instrument presented here is a 19-inch rack-mount controller for a cryogenic MEMS switch network that allows a human operator to see the state of the switch via a row of clearly marked indicator lights and to change the state manually via buttons on an LED-based indicator board or automatically via Python-based serial port commands to the Arduino, an open source microcontroller platform available from multiple vendors. The design can also be modified to control other switches that require either a large voltage or current to switch.</p>

            <p>Enhancing precision sensors for stochastic signals using quantum techniques is a promising emerging field of physics. Estimating a weak stochastic waveform is the core task of many fundamental physics experiments including searches for stochastic gravitational waves, quantum gravity, and axionic dark matter. Simultaneously, noise spectroscopy and characterisation, e.g. estimation of various decay mechanisms in quantum devices, is relevant to a broad range of fundamental and technological applications. We consider the ultimate limit on the sensitivity of these devices for Lindblad estimation given any quantum state, fast and precise control sequence, and measurement scheme. We show that it is optimal to rapidly projectively measure and re-initialise the quantum state. We develop optimal protocols for a wide range of applications including stochastic waveform estimation, spectroscopy with qubits, and Lindblad estimation.</p>

            <h2>Demonstration of Quantum Polarization Microscopy using an Entangled-Photon Source</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mousume Samad, Maki Shimizu, Yasuto Hijikata</p>
            <p>With the advancement of non-classical light sources such as single-photon and entangled-photon sources, innovative microscopy based on the quantum principles has been proposed over traditional microscopy. This paper introduces the experimental demonstration of a quantum polarization microscopic technique that incorporates a quantum-entangled photon source. Although the point that employs the variation of polarization angle due to reflection or transmission at the sample is similar to classical polarization microscopy, the method for constructing image contrast is significantly different. Image contrast is constructed by the coincidence count of signal and idler photons. In the case that coincidence count is recorded from both the signal and idler photons, the photon statistics resemble a thermal state, similar to the blackbody radiation, but with a significantly higher peak intensity in the second order autocorrelation function at zero delay that is derived from coincidence count. While, when the coincidence count is taken from either the signal or idler photon only, though the photon state exhibits a thermal state again, the photon statistics become more dispersive and result in a lower peak intensity of the autocorrelation function. These different thermal states can be switched by slightly changing the photon polarization, which is suddenly aroused within narrow range of analyzer angle. This polarization microscopic technique can provide a superior imaging technique compared to the classical method, opening a new frontier for research in material sciences, biology, and other fields requiring high-resolution imaging.</p>

            <h2>Zeno Freezing and Anti-Zeno Acceleration of the Dynamic Evolution of Acoustic Topological Boundary States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Meng Zhang, Ze-Guo Chen, Guancong Ma, Ming-Hui Lu, Yan-Feng Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum measurements severely disrupt the dynamic evolution of a quantum system by collapsing the probabilistic wavefunction. This principle can be leveraged to control quantum states by effectively freezing the system's dynamics or enhancing transitions between states. These are known as the quantum Zeno effect (ZE) and anti-Zeno effect (AZE), respectively. However, it remains elusive how quantum measurements affect topological states, which are famous for their robustness against disorder and perturbations. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that the dynamic evolution of topological boundary states (TBSs) can be controlled by quantum-like measurement (QLM). Our work is based on spatially modulated topological acoustic waveguide systems with varying parameters that adiabatically pump the TBS across the bulk to the opposite boundary. Therein, the QLM is emulated using a perturbation to the Hamiltonian known as the Zeno subspace. With the help of quantum metrics, we identify the general conditions for ZE and AZE, and experimentally demonstrate their effects in freezing and accelerating the tunneling of the TBS. Furthermore, we discover a tunneling mechanism by varying the strength of the QLM. These results highlight QLM as a versatile tool for manipulating topological states and wave propagation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Sheng Tang, Xun-Wei Xu, Jie-Qiao Liao, Hui Jing, Le-Man Kuang</p>
            <p>The effective frequency of a mechanical resonator can be tuned via the spring effect induced by quadratic optomechanical (QOM) coupling, and both spontaneous symmetry breaking and anti-parity-time phase transition were predicted in the QOM systems. Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced significantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field, and divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical point (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum imaging is an ever expanding research field, in which the aim is to exploit the quantum nature of light to enhance image reconstruction capabilities. Despite a number of successful demonstrations for quantum imaging, quantum microscopy still seems out of the range for practical applications, due to different physical and technical reasons. Here we propose an imaging method exploiting the quantum correlations of photon pairs and a scanning microscope to achieve fast, single mode quantum imaging. We first test our technique on a metal grating to estimate the resolution capabilities of our system. Moreover, we asses its potential in terms of the number of available independent pixels at full resolution compared to different quantum imaging approaches. Finally, we demonstrate scanning quantum microscopy of onion epithelial cells, paving the way towards scalable quantum microscopy for bio-physical applications. Our results, combined with the rapidly evolving photon-pair generation and detection technology towards the mid-infrared, could lead to an extension of quantum microscopy applications towards the mid-infrared, to access the molecular fingerprint region.</p>

            <p>Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods.

            <h2>Modes, states and superselection rules in quantum optics and quantum information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eloi Descamps, Astghik Saharyan, Adrien Chivet, Arne Keller, P√©rola Milman</p>
            <p>A convenient way to represent quantum optical states is through the quadrature basis of single-modes of the field. This framework provides intuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space representations, and a robust toolbox for quantum state manipulation using universal gates. In this widely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of coherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach neglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence between states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a common phase reference - even though global phases are unmeasurable in quantum optics. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects the superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and information encoding within quantum optics. In the introduced framework, general pure states are described using two orthogonal modes in the Fock basis. We show that this approach preserves the intuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying insights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular momentum systems. Moreover, the superselection rule-compliant representation provides a consistent definition of non-purity and coherence for optical modes and states. It offers a clearer and general perspective on quantum universality, non-classicality, and the (im)possibility of efficient classical simulation across various quantum information encoding schemes involving quantum optical modes and states.</p>

            <p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently emerged as a promising method for generating non-classical states of light with frequencies spanning from the infrared up to the extreme ultraviolet regime. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of squeezed states of light through HHG processes in atomic systems that had been initially driven to their first excited state. Our study reveals significant single-mode squeezing in both the driving field and low-order harmonic modes. Additionally, we characterize two-mode squeezing features in the generated states, both between fundamental and harmonic modes, and among the harmonic modes themselves. Using these correlations, we demonstrate the generation of optical Schr√∂dinger kitten states through heralding measurements, specifically via photon subtraction in one of the modes influenced by two-mode squeezing.</p>

            <p>Quantum correlations in four-wave-mixing from ensembles of cold two-level atoms may prevail without filtering over background light with well-known classical interpretations, such as Rayleigh scattering, as recently experimentally demonstrated in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 083601 (2022). Here we provide an extended investigation of this effect, in which we detail the experimental procedure and the variation of the quantum correlation with various parameters of the system. Particularly, we show that the decay rate of the quantum correlations changes with the number of atoms in the sample, providing another indication of its superradiance-like nature. The nonclassical aspects of the signal occur for short timescales, but the long timescales carry as well a lot of information on the classical correlations of the system. This slow classical regime presents also two clearly distinct timescales, which we explain by two different pathways for the creation of biphotons. From the global analysis of the data in all its timescales, we are able to derive an empirical expression to fit the data, resulting in information on, among other parameters, the sample's temperature and superradiant-like acceleration. In general, the reported quantum correlations present a dependence on critical parameters of the system, such as optical depth and excitation power, that is quite different from other systems used for biphoton generation, and are more robust to changes in these parameters. This opens the possibility of exploring this process for efficient generation of narrow-band biphotons or of other quantum-correlated photonic states of higher order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Rivera-Dean, P. Stammer, M. F. Ciappina, M. Lewenstein</p>
            <p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that these non-classical features prompt the HHG process, with the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics depending on the type of squeezing applied. We examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum error mitigation is regarded as a possible path to near-term quantum utility. The methods under the quantum error mitigation umbrella term, such as probabilistic error cancellation, zero-noise extrapolation or Clifford data regression are able to significantly reduce the error for the estimation of expectation values, although at an exponentially scaling cost, i.e., in the sampling overhead. In this work, we present a straightforward method for reducing the sampling overhead of PEC on Clifford circuits (and Clifford subcircuits) via Pauli error propagation alongside some classical preprocessing. While the methods presented in this work are restricted to Clifford circuits, we argue that Clifford sub circuits often occur in relevant calculations as for example the resource state generation in measurement based quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</p>

This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications.

            <p>Quantum optics bridges esoteric notions of entanglement and superposition with practical applications like metrology and communication. Throughout, there is an interplay between information theoretic concepts such as entropy and physical considerations such as quantum system design, noise, and loss. Therefore, a fundamental result at the heart of these fields has numerous ramifications in development of applications and advancing our understanding of quantum physics. Our recent proof for the entanglement properties of states interfering with the vacuum on a beam splitter led to monotonicity and convexity properties for quantum states undergoing photon loss [Lupu-Gladstein et al., arXiv:2411.03423 (2024)] by breathing life into a decades-old conjecture. In this work, we extend these fundamental properties to measures of similarity between states, provide inequalities for creation and annihilation operators beyond the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, prove a conjecture [Hertz et al., PRA 110, 012408 (2024)] dictating that nonclassicality through the quadrature coherence scale is uncertifiable beyond a loss of 50%, and place constraints on quasiprobability distributions of all physical states.

Extending single-species array to mixed-species one promise to offer new possibilities. In our recent proof of principle realization of defect-free two-dimensional assembly of mixed-species $^{85}$Rb ($^{87}$Rb) atom arrays [C. Sheng et al.\href{this https URL}{{\color{blue} Phys. Rev.

In order to scale up the size of defect-free mixed-species atom array, we scale up the tweezer array and improve the atom transfer, and upgrade the heuristic heteronuclear algorithm so as to facilitate multiple rearrangement cycles. Consequently, we successfully create defect-free atom arrays with 120 mixed-species single atoms. The corresponding filling fraction and defect-free probability are improved to be 98.6(1)\% and 14(2)\%, respectively. It is anticipated that the enhanced algorithm can be extended to other combinations of atomic species, and this mixed-species atom array is readily for studies of many-body physics, quantum error correction, and quantum metrology.</p>

These phenomena are attributed to unconventional atomic correlations. Furthermore, we observe chiral superradiance of the TAs, where the degree of chirality can be enhanced by giant CAs instead of small ones.

We analyze the robustness of the state transfer fidelity against various noise and damping mechanisms, including cavity decay, Rydberg state decay, and the relaxation and dephasing of the superconducting qubit. For experimentally demonstrated parameters of interaction strengths, dissipation, and dephasing, our scheme achieves fidelities above 95\%.</p>

            <p>Photonic temporal crystals host a variety of intriguing phenomena, from wave amplification and mixing to exotic band structures, all stemming from the time-periodic modulation of optical properties. While these features have been well described classically, their quantum manifestation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a quantum electrodynamical model of PTCs that reveals a deeper connection between classical and quantum pictures: the classical momentum gap arises from a localization-delocalization quantum phase transition in a Floquet-photonic synthetic lattice. Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a cavity, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state-a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode. Our findings establish photonic temporal crystals as versatile platforms for studying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for controlling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.</p>

            <p>Quantum communications technologies require a network of quantum processors connected with low loss and low noise communication channels capable of distributing entangled states. Superconducting microwave qubits operating in cryogenic environments have emerged as promising candidates for quantum processor nodes. However, scaling these systems is challenging because they require bulky microwave components with high thermal loads that can quickly overwhelm the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator. Telecommunication frequency optical signals, meanwhile, can be fabricated in significantly smaller form factors while avoiding challenges due to high signal loss, noise sensitivity, and thermal loads due to their high carrier frequency and propagation in silica optical fibers. Transduction of information via coherent links between optical and microwave frequencies is therefore critical to leverage the advantages of optics for superconducting microwave qubits, while also enabling superconducting processors to be linked with low-loss optical interconnects. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical control of a superconducting qubit. We achieve this by developing a microwave-optical quantum transducer that operates with up to 1.18% conversion efficiency with low added microwave noise, and demonstrate optically-driven Rabi oscillations in a superconducting qubit.</p>

            <h2>Photon pair generation via down-conversion in III-V semiconductor microrings: modal dispersion and quasi-phase matching</h2>

            <p>We explore how III-V semiconductor microring resonators can efficiently generate photon pairs and squeezed vacuum states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion by utilizing their built-in quasi phase matching and modal dispersion. We present an analytic expression for the biphoton wave function of photon pairs generated by weak pump pulses, and characterize the squeezed states that result under stronger pumping conditions. Our model includes loss, and captures the statistics of the scattered photons. A detailed sample calculation shows that for low pump powers conversion efficiencies of 10$^{-5}$, corresponding to a rate of 39 MHz for a pump power of 1 $\mu$W, are attainable for rudimentary structures such as a simple microring coupled to a waveguide, in both the continuous wave and pulsed excitation regimes. Our results suggest that high levels of squeezing and pump depletion are attainable, possibly leading to the deterministic generation of non-Gaussian states</p>

            <p>We study the implementation of quantum engines and quantum heat pumps where the quantum adiabatic transformations are replaced by quantum Zeno strokes. During these strokes, frequent measurements are selectively performed on the external state of the system avoiding transition between different levels. This effectively delivers almost ideal isentropic transformations.

            <h2>Noise-Mitigated Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Pre-training and Zero-Noise Extrapolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanqi Sun, Jungang Xu, Chenghua Duan</p>
            <p>The variational quantum eigensolver, as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is widely applied in quantum chemistry simulations, especially in computing the electronic structure of complex molecular systems. However, on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, factors such as quantum decoherence, measurement errors, and gate operation imprecisions are unavoidable. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an efficient noise-mitigating variational quantum eigensolver for accurate computation of molecular ground state energies in noisy environments. We design the quantum circuit with reference to the structure of matrix product states and utilize it to pre-train the circuit parameters, which ensures circuit stability and mitigates fluctuations caused by initialization. We also employ zero-noise extrapolation to mitigate quantum noise and combine it with neural networks to improve the accuracy of the noise-fitting function, which significantly eliminates noise interference. Furthermore, we implement intelligent grouping measurements of Hamiltonian Pauli strings, which not only reduces measurement errors but also improves sampling efficiency. We conduct experiments to solve the ground state energy of the $H_4$ molecule on the Mindquantum quantum computing platform, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm can constrain noise errors within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}) \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$, outperforming mainstream variational quantum eigensolver methods. This work provides a new strategy for high-precision quantum chemistry calculations on near-term noisy quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum state transfer of superposed multi-photon states via phonon-induced dynamic resonance in an optomechanical system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanloc Leu, Xuan-Hoai Thi Nguyen, Jinhyoung Lee</p>
            <p>We propose a method to transfer macroscopically superposed states between two optical cavities mediated by a mechanical oscillator, which works in a nonlinear regime of optomechanical interaction. Our approach relies on the phonon-induced dynamic resonance, where the motion of mechanical oscillator dynamically sets on/off the resonance between two cavities. Our method assumes high amplitude limit of oscillator, weak coupling between optical cavities, and adiabatic approximation. We show that, under these conditions, various multi-photon quantum states, especially, Schr{√∂}dinger cat states, can be transferred with nearly perfect fidelity in a deterministic process. We show that transfer fidelity of 0.99 can be achieved using the experimental parameters in currently available technology.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Liu, Zhi-Qiang Liu, Yu Sang, Lei Tan</p>
            <p>We investigate the entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED systems. The system consists of two pairs of two-level giant atoms, $ab$ and $cd$, each independently coupled to its respective one-dimensional waveguide. Initially, entangled states are stored in atom pair $ac$. There we consider three giant atom coupling configurations: separated, braided, and nested. For comparison, the entanglement transfer for small atoms configuration is also studied here. We focus on the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atoms pair $bd$ and atom pair $ab$ in these four coupling configurations. It is shown that the transfer of entanglement in each coupling configuration strongly depends on phase shift. In particular, the braided configuration demonstrates superior performance in entanglement transfer. For the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atom pair $bd$, complete entanglement transfer is presented in braided configuration, a behavior not found in small atom or other giant atom configurations. For the entanglement transfer from atom pair $ac$ to atom pair $ab$, although the maximum entanglement transferred to atom pair $ab$ in the braided configuration is half of that one to atom pair $bd$, it is still higher than that in the small atom, separated, and nested configurations. This study lays the foundation for entanglement transfer between giant atoms in waveguide-QED platforms.</p>

            <p>Photon-pair sources are widely used in quantum optics and quantum information experiments.

Here we report on such a source based on a single atom with three energy levels in ladder configuration and coupled to two optical fiber cavities. We efficiently generate photon pairs with in-fiber emission efficiency of $\eta_{\mathrm{pair}}=16(1)\%$ and study their temporal correlation properties. We simulate theoretically a regime with strong atom-cavity coupling and find that photons are directly emitted from the ground state, i.e. without atomic population in any intermediate state. We propose a scenario to observe such a double-vacuum-stimulated effect experimentally.</p>

Here, we demonstrate plasmon-mediated phonon pumping, driven by inelastic electron hopping in conductive molecules, which results in strong Raman nonlinearity at the light intensities almost three orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional opto-mechanical systems and up to four-fold enhancement of the effective Raman polarizability due to vibrational electron-phonon coupling. We also developed a microscopic framework of opto-mechanical electron-phonon coupling in molecular nanojunctions based on the Marcus electron hopping. Systematically varying electrical conductance of the molecules in the junction and laser intensity, we observed the transition between a photo-assisted tunnelling regime and an electron hopping process. Our findings provide a microscopic description for vibrational, optical, and electronic phenomena in plasmonic nanocavities, representing the first attempt to exploit conductive molecules as practically implementable quantum-mechanical oscillators.</p>

            <h2>Exciton Dynamics and Quantum Efficiencies in Optically Coupled OLEDs: A Unified Quantum Master Equation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olli Siltanen, Kimmo Luoma, Konstantinos S. Daskalakis</p>
            <p>The primary function of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to convert electrons into photons. However, only 25 % of the electronic states (singlets) in electrically excited fluorescent molecules can emit light, which is why triplet harvesting has attracted significant attention. Specifically, one often aims to maximize the rate of triplet-to-singlet conversion, while at the same time, it is crucial to depopulate the singlets fast enough -- before they convert to triplets or interact with other excited states, potentially breaking molecular bonds. Planar microcavities provide a viable architecture to address these issues. By confining the emitters within planar microcavities one can couple the excitons to cavity modes and engineer the population dynamics to one's liking. While the weak-coupling regime is renowned for Purcell-enhanced emission, strongly coupled excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates known as polaritons. To fully understand and optimize exciton-photon interactions and light-emission mechanisms across various coupling regimes, a unified theory of optically coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs is needed. In this article, we introduce a quantum master equation model spanning the zero-, weak-, and strong-coupling regimes. We derive the different rates using Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory, show how the different regimes converge, and finally evaluate the internal quantum efficiencies in all cases.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Generation of Multi-partite Entanglement between Non-local Superconducting Qubits using Classical Feedback</h2>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing, the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical FPGA-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local, multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both protocols for implementing an unbounded fan-out (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT) gate in constant depth between three non-local qubits. Finally, we demonstrate deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on opposite side of our quantum processor.</p>

The exact simulation of these reactions is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. Here, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multispecies trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. By manipulating both the ground-state and optical qubits, we observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.</p>

            <p>Entangled two-photon absorption can enable a linear scaling of fluorescence emission with the excitation power. In comparison to classical two-photon absorption with a quadratic scaling, this can allow fluorescence imaging or photolithography with high axial resolution at minimal exposure intensities. However, most experimental studies on two-photon absorption were not able to show an unambiguous proof of fluorescence emission driven by entangled photon pairs. On the other hand, existing theoretical models struggle to accurately predict the entangled two-photon absorption behavior of chemically complex dyes. In this paper, we introduce an approach to simulate entangled two-photon absorption in common fluorescence dyes considering their chemical properties. Our theoretical model allows a deeper understanding of experimental results and thus the occurrence of entangled two-photon absorption. In particular, we found a remarkable dependency of the absorption probability on the phase-matching temperature of the nonlinear material. Further, we compared results of our theoretical approach to experimental data for Nile Red.</p>

            <p>Fock states of the quantum harmonic oscillator are fundamental to quantum sensing and information processing, serving as key resources for exploiting bosonic degrees of freedom. Here, we prepare high Fock states in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) by coupling it to a superconducting qubit and applying microwave pulses designed using quantum optimal control. We characterize the experimentally realized states by employing a criterion for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG) designed to reveal multiphonon contributions. Although energy relaxation and decoherence limit the achievable fidelities, we demonstrate genuine QNG features compatible with Fock state $\vert 6\rangle$, confirming that the prepared states cannot be generated through Gaussian operations on states with up to Fock state $\vert 5\rangle$ contributions. We further investigate the robustness of these QNG features to losses and their utility in sensing displacement amplitudes. In particular, we introduce a hierarchy based on the quantum Fisher information and show that, despite decoherence and measurement imperfections, the prepared states achieve a displacement sensitivity surpassing that of an ideal Fock state $\vert 3\rangle$. Our results have immediate applications in quantum sensing and simulations with HBAR devices.</p>

            <h2>Optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubit generation via approximate squeezed coherent state superposition breeding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew J. Pizzimenti, Daniel Soh</p>
            <p>Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits, known for their exceptional error-correction capabilities, are highly coveted in quantum computing. However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement-based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement-based methods can produce high-quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed coherent state superpositions created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than strictly photon number resolving measurement-based methods, while still producing states with high fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.</p>

            <p>We present and experimentally demonstrate a novel approach to verification and benchmarking of quantum computing, implementing it on an ion-trap quantum computer. Unlike previous information-theoretically secure verification protocols, which typically require quantum communication between client and server, our approach is implemented entirely on-chip. This eliminates the need for a quantum client and significantly enhances practicality. We perform tomography to justify the additionally required assumption that the noise is independent of the secret used to prepare the Server's single-qubit states. We quantify the soundness error which may be caused by residual secret dependencies. We demonstrate our protocol on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processing unit, using qubit measurements and resets to construct measurement patterns with up to 52 vertices. To our knowledge, these are the largest verified measurement-based quantum computations performed to date. Our results pave the way for more accessible and efficient verification and benchmarking strategies in near-term quantum devices, enabling robust performance assessment without the added cost of external quantum infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in the engineering of diamond surface make it possible to stabilize the charge state of 7-30 nanometers deep nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensors in diamond and to principally remove the charge noise at the surface. However, it is still a challenge to simultaneously increase the action volume of the quantum sensor by placing NV centers 0.5-2 nanometers deep and maintain their favorable spin coherence properties which will be definitely limited by the magnetic noise from the fluctuating nuclear spins of the terminating surface species of diamond. Here we show that leveraging the interplay of the surface induced strain and small constant magnetic fields, the spin coherence times of the ultra-shallow 1-nanometer deep NV center can be significantly enhanced up to the spin-phonon limited regime at room temperature in $^{12}$C enriched diamonds. We demonstrate that our measurement protocol is beneficial to $\sim$10-nanometers deep NV centers too in diamonds with naturally abundant carbon isotopes where the variable response of the spin bath to the direction of the small constant magnetic fields establishes vector magnetometry at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>Interactions among sensors can provide, in addition to entanglement, an important resource for boosting the precision in quantum estimation protocols. Dephasing noise, however, remains a leading source of decoherence in state-of-the-art quantum sensing platforms. We analyze the impact of classical {\em collective dephasing with arbitrary temporal correlations} on the performance of generalized Ramsey interferometry protocols with \emph{quadratic} encoding of a target frequency parameter. The optimal asymptotic precision bounds are derived for both product coherent spin states and for a class of experimentally relevant entangled spin-squeezed states of $N$ qubit sensors. While, as in linear metrology, entanglement offers no advantage if the noise is Markovian, a precision scaling of $N^{-1}$ is reachable with classical input states in the quadratic setting, which is improved to $N^{-5/4}$ when temporal correlations are present and the Zeno regime is accessible. The use of nonclassical spin-squeezed states and a nonlinear readout further allows for an $N^{-3/2}$ precision scaling, which we prove is asymptotically optimal. We also show how to counter {\em noise-induced bias} by introducing a simple ratio estimator which relies on detecting two suitable system observables, and show that it remains asymptotically unbiased in the presence of dephasing, without detriment to the achievable precision.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qile Su, Rodrigo G. Corti√±as, Jayameenakshi Venkatraman, Shruti Puri</p>
            <p>The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily with the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator), whose energy barrier can be increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a step-like decrease termed the "staircase". The view challenged by the experiment demands a deep review of our understanding of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical formula for the switching rate that resolves a continuous transition between tunneling- and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat and the steep parts of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: dephasing and decay. This allows us to predict the critical drive amplitudes where steps occur. In addition, we show that in the regime of a few states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, however, the perturbation induced by the nonhermitian Hamiltonian becomes important and facilitates a new form of quantum heating. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.</p>

We employ coherence defined by l1-norm to analyze the non-Markovian effects in the spin-boson model. In the transformed frame of reference, the correlation timescales for the bath are significantly shorter than the system's relaxation timescale-a key assumption for Markovian dynamics. However, intriguingly, we demonstrate that under the large polaron theory, the reduced dynamics exhibit effective non-Markovian behaviour within a specific range of couplings, while remaining Markovian beyond this range.</p>

To simplify calculations under strong coupling, we adopt the Lang-Firsov transformation, effectively minimizing system-bath interactions. Within the polaron perspective using Ohmic bath spectral density with a Gaussian cutoff, we identify a fundamental timescale $s$ (equivalently a length scale $l$), dictating coherence decay. Utilizing a quantum master equation in the energy eigen basis while maintaining fixed particle number, we demonstrate that coherence persists for small $s$ values but diminishes for larger ones. Additionally, we explore the utilization of $\pi$-pulses to manipulate decoherence within the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Xia Niu, Qian Wang</p>
            <p>Long-range interacting quantum systems are useful for improving the performance of various applications of quantum technologies. In this work, we carry out a detailed analysis of how the long-range interaction affects the measurement precision in critical quantum metrology. By employing the paradigmatic model of a Kiteav chain with power-law decaying interaction, we focus on the impacts of long-range interaction on the critical sensing for the scenarios with and without uncertainty in system this http URL show that the long-range interaction can be used as a valuable resource for enhancing the sensitivity of critical parameter estimation in both scenarios. Our findings not only provide more insights into the features of the long-range interacting systems, but also verify the usefulness of long-range interacting systems in quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>This study presents the coherent and dissipative coupling realized in the hybrid photonic resonators that have been achieved via the constructive and destructive interference of the photonic resonator fields with the radiation of a common transmission line fed with microwave photons. In the dissipative coupling regime we have found the coexistence of a peculiar phenomenon bound state in the continuum (BIC) near the crossing of frequency of the uncoupled resonators by satisfying the Friedrich-Wintgen BICs condition. Again just by rotating one of the samples and with the dynamic adjustment of a parameter we have achieved coupling induced transparency between the photonic resonators. This transition from BIC in the absorption regime to transparency opens avenues for different sorts of plain or programmable oscillators, filters, quantum information processors, sensors etc.</p>

            <h2>Pseudorandom quantum authentication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Haug, Nikhil Bansal, Wai-Keong Mok, Dax Enshan Koh, Kishor Bharti</p>
            <p>We introduce the pseudorandom quantum authentication scheme (PQAS), an efficient method for encrypting quantum states that relies solely on the existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). The scheme guarantees that for any eavesdropper with quantum polynomial-time (QPT) computational power, the encrypted states are indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. Furthermore, the receiver can verify that the state has not been tampered with and recover the original state with asymptotically unit fidelity. Our scheme is cost-effective, requiring only polylogarithmic circuit depth and a single shared key to encrypt a polynomial number of states. Notably, the PQAS can potentially exist even without quantum-secure one-way functions, requiring fundamentally weaker computational assumptions than semantic classical cryptography. Additionally, PQAS is secure against attacks that plague protocols based on QPT indistinguishability from Haar random states, such as chosen-plaintext attacks (CPAs) and attacks that reveal meta-information such as quantum resources. We relate the amount of meta-information that is leaked to quantum pseudoresources, giving the concept a practical meaning. As an application, we construct important cryptographic primitives, such as verifiable pseudorandom density matrices (VPRDMs), which are QPT-indistinguishable from random mixed states while being efficiently verifiable via a secret key, as well as verifiable noise-robust EFI pairs and one-way state generators (OWSGs). Our results establish a new paradigm of quantum information processing with weaker computational assumptions.</p>

            <p>The characterization of high-dimensional entanglement plays a crucial role in the field of quantum information science. Conventional methods perform either fixed measurement bases or randomized measurements with high-order moments. Here, we introduce a criterion for estimating the Schmidt number of bipartite high-dimensional states based on local randomized projections with first-order moments. To extract more information from limited experimental data, we propose an estimation algorithm of the Schmidt number. We exhibit the performance of the proposed approach by considering the maximally entangled state under depolarizing and random noise models. Our approach not only obtains a more accurate estimation of the Schmidt number but also reduces the number of projections compared to known methods.</p>

            <p>Increasing the size and complexity of quantum information systems requires highly-multiplexed readout architectures, as well as amplifier chains operating near the quantum limit (QL) of added noise. While documented prior efforts in KITWPA integration in quantum systems are scarce, in this work we demonstrate integration of a KI-TWPA with a multiplexed-qubit device. To quantify the system noise improvement we perform an ac Stark shift calibration to precisely determine noise power levels on-chip (at each cavity's reference plane) and the total system gain. We then characterize the qubit state measurement fidelity and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To conduct the most faithful measurement of the benefits offered by the KI-TWPA we perform these measurements for readout chains where the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier is the first-stage amplifier (FSA) - with none of the external hardware required to operate the KI-TWPA - and with the KI-TWPA as the FSA. While some readout cavities fall outside the KI-TWPA bandwidth, for those inside the bandwidth we demonstrate a maximum improvement in the state measurement SNR by a factor of 1.45, and increase the fidelity from 96.2% to 97.8%. These measurements demonstrate a system noise below 5 quanta referenced on-chip and we bound the KI-TWPA excess noise to be below 4 quanta for the six cavities inside its bandwidth. These results show a promising path forward for realizing quantum-limited readout chains in large qubit systems using a single parametric amplifier.</p>

            <p>Atom-field interactions, induced by the vacuum of the electromagnetic field, exhibit a variety of fundamental phenomena and effects. In this paper, we study the electromagnetically induced atomic grating due to the vacuum state of the radiation field. Using an ensemble of cold atoms, strongly coupled to an optical cavity, we show that a probe field, propagating through the atomic medium, diffracts to zeroth and first-order diffraction peaks with few photons and even by the electromagnetic vacuum field of the cavity mode. As the number of photons in the cavity increases, the intensity of the first-order diffraction peak initially rises and then exhibits a decreasing trend. Furthermore, we observe that the first-order peak intensity reaches its maximum at resonance for both the vacuum and single-photon cavity state. However, as the number of photons increases further, this peak at resonance transforms into a dip, accompanied by two side peaks at off-resonance positions. This transition from a peak to a dip may potentially be used to distinguish the quantum state of the cavity.</p>

Our results demonstrate that the corrections exhibit significant sensitivity to both the distance between the two parallel plates and the order parameter of the weak field.

            <p>We study the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) numerically and investigate thermodynamic behavior of cSYK model across varying chemical potentials. We discover that the cSYK model remarkably mirrors the first-order phase transition seen in the van der Waals-Maxwell system, culminating at a non-mean-field critical point with distinctively different critical exponents. We analyze in detail the similarity between the van der Waals phase transition and the cSYK model, and further explore the mechanism by which the chemical potential drives the phase transition in the system. Exact diagonalization for the cSYK model reveals the significant impact of chemical potential on energy distribution, with observable energy gaps in the gapped phase. Quantum chaos indicators, including spectral form factors, suggest more stable energy states in the neutral case. Real-time dynamics, analyzed via analytical continuation of Schwinger-Dyson equations, show rapid decay in the gapless phase and prolonged oscillation lifetimes in the gapped regime. Spectral functions imply a shift from a continuous to a discrete energy level distribution, emphasizing the critical role of chemical potential in shaping spectral properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Sienicki</p>
            <p>This paper explores the intersection of identity, individuality, and reality through competing frameworks, including classical metaphysics, quantum mechanics, and computational theories. Traditional metaphysical notions of fixed identity are challenged by advancements in cloning, teletransportation, and digital replication, which reveal the fluid and relational nature of individuality. Quantum mechanics further complicates these notions, emphasizing the indistinguishability and contextuality of fundamental particles. Computational approaches, such as the Ruliad and Constructor Theory, offer expansive views of emergent realities but often lack practical constraints for observer relevance. Algorithmic idealism is introduced as a unifying framework, proposing that reality is an emergent construct governed by computational rules prioritizing coherence, sufficiency, and observer-dependent experiences. By redefining identity as an informational construct and reality as a process shaped by algorithmic transitions, algorithmic idealism resolves foundational paradoxes and offers a superior lens for understanding existence in an increasingly digital and interconnected world. The framework bridges gaps between competing theories, providing a coherent and pragmatic model for addressing ethical, metaphysical, and technological challenges.</p>

            <p>A comprehensive study integrating the microscopic structure of spacetime and the principle of quantum superposition is capable of offering a fundamental bottom-up approach for understanding the quantum aspect of gravity. In this paper, we present a framework for the superposition causal diamond spacetime and analyze the behavior of quantum entanglement influenced by the spacetime superposition from the perspective of relativistic quantum information. For the first time, we combine the concept of spacetime superposition with causal diamonds and derive the analytical expression of the Unruh-diamond vacuum state for Dirac fields in the superposed causal diamond spacetime. Based on this, we analyze both initially correlated and uncorrelated modes in superposed and classical causal diamond spacetimes, and quantify how quantum thermal effects arising from spacetime structure alter entanglement. Our findings reveal that quantum entanglement degrades in classical diamond spacetime, while the superposing structure of spacetime generates additional entanglement resources between modes in superposed diamond spacetimes. From a quantum information perspective, our results suggest that the characteristics of spacetime superposition can serve as valuable resources for performing quantum information processing tasks.</p>

We outline and discuss several outstanding challenges, including the need to explore and identify the organisational principles that can guide the development of theories, key experimental phenomenologies that continue to confound, and the formulation of methods that enable progress.

To assess the potential of ST2, we map out its basic optical characteristics, reveal its electronic level structure, and quantify the intrinsic transition rates. Furthermore, we investigate its response to microwaves, static magnetic fields, and the polarization of excitation laser light, revealing twelve inequivalent orientations of the ST2 center. Simultaneous exposure to microwaves and static magnetic fields also reveals an exceptionally wide acceptance angle for sensing strong magnetic fields, unlike the well-established NV center, which is sensitive only within a narrow cone aligned with its symmetry axis. This finding establishes the ST2 center as a highly promising candidate for nanoscale quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>The learner's ability to generate a hypothesis that closely approximates the target function is crucial in machine learning. Achieving this requires sufficient data; however, unauthorized access by an eavesdropping learner can lead to security risks. Thus, it is important to ensure the performance of the "authorized" learner by limiting the quality of the training data accessible to eavesdroppers. Unlike previous studies focusing on encryption or access controls, we provide a theorem to ensure superior learning outcomes exclusively for the authorized learner with quantum label encoding. In this context, we use the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) learning framework and introduce the concept of learning probability to quantitatively assess learner performance. Our theorem allows the condition that, given a training dataset, an authorized learner is guaranteed to achieve a certain quality of learning outcome, while eavesdroppers are not. Notably, this condition can be constructed based only on the authorized-learning-only measurable quantities of the training data, i.e., its size and noise degree. We validate our theoretical proofs and predictions through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) image classification learning.</p>

Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current.

            <h2>Black Hole Waterfall: a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation with Page curve</h2>

            <p>We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation based on the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) \cite{Alsing:2015,Alsing:2016} when the black hole (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero mass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the interior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further generate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains behind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking radiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for the evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole internal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises at early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated, reaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon complete evaporation of the black hole. The entire system remains in a pure state at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the initial state of the black hole modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but finite number $n_{p0}$ of particles. For the final state of the system, the black hole reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking radiation carries away the total energy of the initial black hole. Inside the horizon there remains $n_{p0}$ Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small total energy, reminiscent of the "soft-hair" (zero energy) qubit model of Hotta, Nambu and Yamaguchi \cite{Hotta_Nambu_Yamaguchi:2018}, but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state generation perspective. The model presented here can be readily extended to encompass arbitrary initial pure states for the black hole, and in falling matter.</p>

We perform infinite density matrix renormalization group to contract the two-dimensional tensor network. We present the numerical result of magnetization and entanglement entropy for the Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet side by side. In order to determine the critical line in the parameter space of temperature and magnetic field, we use the half-chain entanglement entropy of the one-dimensional quantum state.

            <p>Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem. There is a widespread belief that this statement implies an exponential scaling, $\sim 2^{N/\beta}$, of necessary computational efforts (classical or quantum), with the number of spins, $N$. Yet, what is a factor $\beta$ here and are there any fundamental limits on how large it can be? Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, characterized by $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. We argue that with a further improvement of annealing protocols, post-processing algorithms and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further.

            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</p>

However, for products of more than two codes, product expansion is a strictly stronger property. In this paper, we prove that the collection of random codes over a sufficiently large field has good product expansion. We believe that in the case of four codes, these ideas can be used to construct good quantum locally testable codes in a way similar to the current constructions using only products of two codes.</p>

We examine how the information for various quantum states evolves with changes in the width of the potential well. For both potentials, the Shannon entropy decreases in position space and increases in momentum space as the width increases, maintaining a constant sum of entropies, consistent with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The Fisher information measure shows different behaviors for the two potentials: it remains nearly constant for the quartic potential. For the symmetric well potential, the Fisher information decreases in position space and increases in momentum space as localization in position space increases, also consistent with the analogue of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Additionally, the Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski inequality is evaluated across various cases and is confirmed to hold in each instance.</p>

Treating the initial error parameter and the dimension as constants, we show that our procedure has sample complexity asymptotically optimal in the final error parameter. Our protocol has a simple recursive structure that can be applied when the states are provided one at a time in a streaming fashion, requiring only a small quantum memory to implement.</p>

A fundamental question is whether learning can be performed at the Heisenberg limit, where the Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the error, $\varepsilon$, in the reconstructed parameters. The Heisenberg limit has previously been shown to be achievable for certain classes of qubit and bosonic Hamiltonians. Most recently, a Heisenberg-limited learning algorithm was proposed for a simplified class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians restricted to real hopping amplitudes and zero chemical potential at all sites, along with on-site interactions. In this work, we provide an algorithm to learn a more general class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit, allowing complex hopping amplitudes and nonzero chemical potentials in addition to the on-site interactions, thereby including several models of physical interest. The required evolution time across all experiments in our protocol is $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ and the number of experiments required to learn all the Hamiltonian parameters is $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$, independent of system size as long as each fermionic mode interacts with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ other modes. Unlike prior algorithms for bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians, to obey fermionic parity superselection constraints in our more general setting, our protocol utilizes $\mathcal{O}(N)$ ancillary fermionic modes, where $N$ is the system size. Each experiment involves preparing fermionic Gaussian states, interleaving time evolution with fermionic linear optics unitaries, and performing local occupation number measurements on the fermionic modes. The protocol is robust to a constant amount of state preparation and measurement error.</p>

            <h2>Quantum speed limit and nonclassicality in open quantum system models using the Wigner function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arti Gaharwar, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>The quantum speed limit and the Wigner function of open system models are studied. To this end, we use the phase covariant and a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath via position-dependent coupling. The dependence of the coupling on the position of the qubits allows for the study of the dynamics in the collective regime, which is conducive to speeding up the evolution. An interesting interplay is observed between non-Markovian behavior, quantumness, and the quantum speed limit. The presence of quantum correlations is seen to speed up the evolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Li Ye, Christian Arenz, Joseph M. Lukens, Ying-Cheng Lai</p>
            <p>Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mihyang Yu, Jeonghan Lee, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jieun Lee</p>
            <p>Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond and silicon carbide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we realize a device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon emission using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allow robust and persistent generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect structures of h-BN crystal. Our work facilitates implementing efficient and miniaturized single-photon devices in van der Waals platforms toward applications in quantum optoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Quantum instability and semiclassical approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. E. Camblong, A. Chakraborty, P. Lopez-Duque, C. Ord√≥√±ez</p>
            <p>Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability, which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate.</p>

            <p>This study presents the design, simulation, and experimental characterization of a superconducting transmon qubit circuit prototype for potential applications in dark matter detection experiments. We describe a planar circuit design featuring two non-interacting transmon qubits, one with fixed frequency and the other flux tunable. Finite-element simulations were employed to extract key Hamiltonian parameters and optimize component geometries. The qubit was fabricated and then characterized at $20$ mK, allowing for a comparison between simulated and measured qubit parameters. Good agreement was found for transition frequencies and anharmonicities (within 1\% and 10\% respectively) while coupling strengths exhibited larger discrepancies (30\%). We discuss potential causes for measured coherence times falling below expectations ($T_1\sim\,$1-2 \textmu s) and propose strategies for future design improvements. Notably, we demonstrate the application of a hybrid 3D-2D simulation approach for energy participation ratio evaluation, yielding a more accurate estimation of dielectric losses. This work represents an important first step in developing planar Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) single-photon counters for dark matter searches, particularly for axion and dark photon detection schemes.</p>

            <p>The Purcell effect, a common issue in qubit-resonator systems leading to both fidelity and nonclassicality losses is studied while its suppression is achieved using a novel qubit readout circuit design. Our approach utilizes a unique coupling architecture in which, the qubit first interacts with a filter resonator before coupling to the readout resonator. This configuration enables precise control over the Purcell decay rate and ac Stark factor without impacting on measuring time. The mentioned factor is highly sensitive to the coupling strength between the readout resonator and the filter, meaning that the factor adjustment directly impacts the qubit state detection. A major advantage of this design is that tuning the resonator-filter coupling strength is relatively straightforward, offering flexibility in fine-tuning ac Stark factor. This work extensively analyzes the system using full quantum mechanical theory, deriving the total Hamiltonian and investigates mode dynamics via quantum Langevin equations. Key parameters influencing the nonclassicality of output signals are also explored through quantum correlation metrics, including symplectic eigenvalues, quantum discord, and classical discord. The main goal is to find any compromises exsting between the ac Stark factor increasing and the quantum correlation created in the readout circuit. By optimizing the critical factors, by which the ac Stark factor mainly affected, the proposed design not only improves the distinguishability of the qubit states but also ensures robust nonclassicality in the output signals. Results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to bridge the gap between a high fidelity readout and quantum correlation preservation in scalable quantum architectures.</p>

            <h2>Universal coarse geometry of spin systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Elokl, Corey Jones</p>
            <p>The prospect of realizing highly entangled states on quantum processors with fundamentally different hardware geometries raises the question: to what extent does a state of a quantum spin system have an intrinsic geometry? In this paper, we propose that both states and dynamics of a spin system have a canonically associated coarse geometry, in the sense of Roe, on the set of sites in the thermodynamic limit. For a state $\phi$ on an (abstract) spin system with an infinite collection of sites $X$, we define a universal coarse structure $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}$ on the set $X$ with the property that a state has decay of correlations with respect to a coarse structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ if and only if $\mathcal{E}_{\phi}\subseteq \mathcal{E}$. We show that under mild assumptions, the coarsely connected completion $(\mathcal{E}_{\phi})_{con}$ is stable under quasi-local perturbations of the state $\phi$. We also develop in parallel a dynamical coarse structure for arbitrary quantum channels, and prove a similar stability result. We show that several order parameters of a state only depend on the coarse structure of an underlying spatial metric, and we establish a basic compatibility between the dynamical coarse structure associated to a quantum circuit $\alpha$ and the coarse structure of the state $\psi\circ \alpha$ where $\psi$ is any product state.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic limitations on fault-tolerant quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mykhailo Bilokur, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Shayan Majidy</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermodynamic limits on scaling fault-tolerant quantum computers due to heating from quantum error correction (QEC). Quantum computers require error correction, which accounts for 99.9% of the qubit demand and generates heat through information-erasing processes. This heating increases the error rate, necessitating more rounds of error correction. We introduce a dynamical model that characterizes heat generation and dissipation for arrays of qubits weakly coupled to a refrigerator and identify a dynamical phase transition between two operational regimes: a bounded-error phase, where temperature stabilizes and error rates remain below fault-tolerance thresholds, and an unbounded-error phase, where rising temperatures drive error rates beyond sustainable levels, making fault tolerance infeasible. Applying our model to a superconducting qubit system performing Shor's algorithm to factor 2048-bit RSA integers, we find that current experimental parameters place the system in the bounded-error phase. Our results indicate that, while inherent heating can become significant, this thermodynamic constraint should not limit scalable fault tolerance if current hardware capabilities are maintained as systems scale.</p>

            <p>L-systems can be made to model and create simulations of many biological processes, such as plant development. Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a massively time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-system) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</p>

            <h2>Wave function evolution from source to detection and the measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> LiHua Yu</p>
            <p>We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates through free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to a detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We consider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of the wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the detection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the slits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function evolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the vertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an approximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the function characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows wider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally collapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope of this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits. Hence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the Schroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is narrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit, where it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is lost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase information, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the y-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on the counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe the process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show this function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is closely related to the wave function.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the constraints of the transmon qubit, an improved version of the charge qubit, on bosonic light dark matters. Phonon excitations induced by the scattering or absorption of dark matter on a superconductor may destroy the Cooper pair, leading to the production of quasiparticles made by the electron. By measuring the production rate of the quasiparticle density, one may read out the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter, assuming that these quasiparticles are solely induced by dark matter interactions. For the first time, we show constraints on the parameter space of the dark photon, light scalar dark matter, and axion-like particles from the measurement of quasiparticles in transmon qubit experiments. This study offers insights for the development of quantum qubit experiments aimed at the direct detection of dark matter in underground laboratories.</p>

            <p>Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</p>

            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol.

We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement in a two-mode cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of two cross-microwave (MW) cavities having a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which is coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. Our results show that the self-Kerr effect of magnon can significantly enhance multipartite entanglement, which turns out to be nonreciprocal when the magnetic field is tuned along the crystallographic axis [110]. This is due to the frequency shift on the magnons (YIG sphere), which depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Interestingly, the degree of nonreciprocity of bipartite entanglements depends upon a careful optimal choice of system parameters like normalized cavity detunings, bipartite nonlinear index, self-Kerr coefficient, and effective magnomechanical coupling rate G. In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements. Our present theoretical proposal for nonreciprocity in multipartite entanglement may find applications in diverse engineering nonreciprocal devices</p>

            <h2>Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Emerging Quadrature Lattices of Kerr Combs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eran Lustig, Melissa A. Guidry, Daniil M. Lukin, Shanhui Fan, Jelena Vuckovic</p>
            <p>A quadrature lattice is a coupled array of squeezed vacuum field quadratures that offers new avenues in shaping the quantum properties of multimode light [1-3]. Such lattices are described within the framework of non-Hermitian, non-dissipative physics and exhibit intriguing lattice phenomena such as lattice exceptional points, edge-states, entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect, offering fundamentally new methods for controlling quantum fluctuations [1, 4]. Nonlinear resonators are suitable for studying multimode pair-generation processes and squeezing which are non-dissipative in \chi(2) and \chi(3) materials [5-12], but observing non-Hermitian lattice phenomena in photonic quadrature lattices was not achieved. Remarkably, in dissipative Kerr microcombs [13], which have revolutionized photonic technology, such lattices emerge and govern the quantum noise that leads to comb formation. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to realize quadrature lattices, and to study and manipulate multimode quantum noise which is essential for any quantum technology. Here, we experimentally study non-Hermitian lattice effects in photonic quadrature lattices for the first time. Our photonic quadrature lattices emerge at Kerr microcomb transitions, allowing us to observe fundamental connections between dispersion symmetry, frequency-dependent squeezed supermodes, and non-Hermitian lattice physics in an integrated setup. Our work unifies two major fields, quantum non-Hermitian physics and Kerr combs, and opens the door to utilizing dissipative Kerr combs to experimentally explore rich non-Hermitian physics in the quantum regime, engineer quantum light, and develop new tools to study the quantum noise and formation of Kerr combs.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calder√≥n, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions.

Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tongyuan Bao, Qi Luo, Ailun Yin, Yao Zhang, Haibo Hu, Zhengtong Liu, Shumin Xiao, Xin Ou, Yu Zhou, Qinghai Song</p>
            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase estimation and realistic detection schemes in Mach-Zehnder interferometer using SU(2) coherent states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Abdellaoui, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishna Shende, Matreyee Kandpal, Arvind, Kavita Dorai</p>
            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <h2>Extensive manipulation of transition rates and substantial population inversion of rotating atoms inside a cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Critical spectrum of the anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong Li, Daniel Braak, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <h2>Towards a General Framework for Practical Quantum Network Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet Khatri</p>
            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <p>This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mo Zhou, F. A. C√°rdenas-L√≥pez, Sugny Dominique, Xi Chen</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Abdellaoui, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</p>

            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol.

We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances.

            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths.

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Multipartite Entanglement in a two-cavity magnomechanical system</h2>

            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement in a two-mode cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of two cross-microwave (MW) cavities having a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which is coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. Our results show that the self-Kerr effect of magnon can significantly enhance multipartite entanglement, which turns out to be nonreciprocal when the magnetic field is tuned along the crystallographic axis [110]. This is due to the frequency shift on the magnons (YIG sphere), which depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Interestingly, the degree of nonreciprocity of bipartite entanglements depends upon a careful optimal choice of system parameters like normalized cavity detunings, bipartite nonlinear index, self-Kerr coefficient, and effective magnomechanical coupling rate G. In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements. Our present theoretical proposal for nonreciprocity in multipartite entanglement may find applications in diverse engineering nonreciprocal devices</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <p>This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <h2>Chaos and spatial prethermalization in driven-dissipative bosonic chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calder√≥n, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rizwan Ahmed, Hazrat Ali, Aamir Shehzad, S K Singh, Amjad Sohail, Marcos Cesar de Oliveira</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for the generation of nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement in a two-mode cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of two cross-microwave (MW) cavities having a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which is coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. Our results show that the self-Kerr effect of magnon can significantly enhance multipartite entanglement, which turns out to be nonreciprocal when the magnetic field is tuned along the crystallographic axis [110]. This is due to the frequency shift on the magnons (YIG sphere), which depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Interestingly, the degree of nonreciprocity of bipartite entanglements depends upon a careful optimal choice of system parameters like normalized cavity detunings, bipartite nonlinear index, self-Kerr coefficient, and effective magnomechanical coupling rate G. In addition to bipartite entanglement, we also present the idea of a bidirectional contrast ratio, which quantifies the nonreciprocity in tripartite entanglements. Our present theoretical proposal for nonreciprocity in multipartite entanglement may find applications in diverse engineering nonreciprocal devices</p>

            <h2>Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <p>This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <h2>Chaos and spatial prethermalization in driven-dissipative bosonic chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calder√≥n, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Microwave-Optical Entanglement in Kerr-Modified Cavity Optomagnomechanics</h2>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase estimation and realistic detection schemes in Mach-Zehnder interferometer using SU(2) coherent states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Abdellaoui, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara</p>
            <p>In quantum parameter estimation, the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable with unbiased estimators. It relates the uncertainty in estimating a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Both QCRB and QFI are valuable tools for analyzing interferometric phase sensitivity. This paper compares the single-parameter and two-parameter QFI for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with three detection schemes: single-mode and difference intensity detection, neither has access to an external phase reference and balanced homodyne detection with access to an external phase reference. We use a spin-coherent state associated with the su(2) algebra as the input state in all scenarios and show that all three schemes can achieve the QCRB for the spin-coherent input state. Furthermore, we explore the utilization of SU(2) coherent states in diverse scenarios. Significantly, we find that the best pressure is obtained when the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is high, and we demonstrate that given optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing SU(2) coherent states as input states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishna Shende, Matreyee Kandpal, Arvind, Kavita Dorai</p>
            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Critical spectrum of the anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong Li, Daniel Braak, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <h2>Towards a General Framework for Practical Quantum Network Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet Khatri</p>
            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tongyuan Bao, Qi Luo, Ailun Yin, Yao Zhang, Haibo Hu, Zhengtong Liu, Shumin Xiao, Xin Ou, Yu Zhou, Qinghai Song</p>
            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. While micro-ring cavities have been extensively studied in SiC and other materials, the integration of 4H-SiC spin defects into these critical structures, along with continuous mode tunability, remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of PL4 divacancy spin defects into tunable micro-ring cavities in scalable thin-film 4H-SiC nanophotonics. Comparing on- and off-resonance conditions, we observed an enhancement of the Purcell factor by approximately 5.0. This enhancement effectively confined coherent photons within the coupled waveguide, leading to a twofold increase in the ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance) contrast and coherent control of PL4 spins. These advancements lay the foundation for developing SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Control for Open Quantum System in Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mo Zhou, F. A. C√°rdenas-L√≥pez, Sugny Dominique, Xi Chen</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum systems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a linear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in energy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such as counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled to a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio comparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon numbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in dissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Experimental investigation of a quantum Otto heat engine with shortcuts to adiabaticity implemented using counter-adiabatic driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishna Shende, Matreyee Kandpal, Arvind, Kavita Dorai</p>
            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>In this letter we propose a new interpretation of the Casimir effect. Concretely, we show that the Casimir energy can be written as the quantum ``Von Neumann'' entropy associated to a 2-qubit, mixed, non-separable, pseudo-density matrix of the relevant quantum fluctuations. The quantum entropy we introduce draws parallels to the concept of quantum inseparability found in quantum information theory. Our results suggest that the Casimir energy is a measure of the entanglement of quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Extensive manipulation of transition rates and substantial population inversion of rotating atoms inside a cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Peng, Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations inside a high-quality cavity. Our findings reveal that the emission and excitation rates can be extensively manipulated by adjusting the cavity's normal mode frequency and the rotational angular velocity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, while the emission rate remains negligible, trailing by 9 orders of magnitude. This suggests the potential for substantial population inversion in an ensemble of atoms. In another scenario, both the emission and excitation rates can simultaneously reach magnitudes as high as $10^7~{\rm s}^{-1}$, indicating that millions of transitions per second are expected even for a single atom. These remarkable results not only offer a new method for controlling the radiative properties of atoms but also open avenues for the experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect using cutting-edge quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Critical spectrum of the anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong Li, Daniel Braak, Qing-Hu Chen</p>
            <p>The anisotropic two-photon quantum Rabi model is studied using the Bogoliubov operator approach. The doubly degenerate exceptional states are identified through analytical methods. By adjusting the position of the last exceptional point belonging to two adjacent energy levels, we derive a condition for the absence of the discrete spectrum at the critical coupling where ``spectral collapse" occurs. In this special case, the spectrum becomes fully continuous above a threshold energy, with no bound states existing, whereas the ground state remains gapped in the general case. This also signals a quantum phase transition. More interestingly, we rigorously find that a finite number of bound states exist between two anisotropy dependent critical atomic frequencies, with infinitely many bound states beyond this frequency regime. In this manner, all issues in the two-photon quantum Rabi model are resolved.</p>

            <h2>Towards a General Framework for Practical Quantum Network Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet Khatri</p>
            <p>The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement and to guide the realization of large-scale quantum networks, and eventually the quantum internet, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies. This work provides an initial step towards this goal. The main contribution of this thesis is a mathematical framework for entanglement distribution protocols in a quantum network, which allows for discovering optimal protocols using reinforcement learning. We start with a general development of quantum decision processes, which is the theoretical backdrop of reinforcement learning. Then, we define the general task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network, and we present ground- and satellite-based quantum network architectures that incorporate practical aspects of entanglement distribution. We combine the theory of decision processes and the practical quantum network architectures into an overall entanglement distribution protocol. We also define practical figures of merit to evaluate entanglement distribution protocols, which help to guide experimental implementations.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Shu, Yining Jiang, Hao Wu, Mark Oxborrow</p>
            <p>We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</p>

            <h2>Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Mei Xie, Yu-Shuo Lu, Yao Fu, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Wang, Frank Mueller</p>
            <p>This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reyhan Ay, Adipta Pal, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Microwave-Optical Entanglement in Kerr-Modified Cavity Optomagnomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Yue Liu, Yuan Gong, Jiaojiao Chen, Yan-Wei Wang, Wei Xiong</p>
            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>
