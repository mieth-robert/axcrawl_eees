            <h2>An Ontological Interpretation of Photon Wave-Particle Duality via Complex-Space Trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiang-Yi Han, Ciann-Dong Yang</p>
            <p>Wave particle duality remains a central interpretational challenge in quantum theory. In this work, we develop a trajectory-based description of photon dynamics formulated in an extended complex space within the relativistic quantum Hamilton Jacobi framework. In this approach, photon motion is represented by complex trajectories whose real projections describe propagation, while imaginary components encode oscillatory structure. We show that momentum eigenstates correspond to straight line trajectories with uniform propagation at the speed of light, whereas superposition states lead to nontrivial quantum potentials and oscillatory motion in the complex plane. Extending the analysis to complex two dimensional space reveals richer dynamical behavior, including propagating wave like trajectories and standing wave like patterns in real projections. Energy momentum consistency is verified through an internal coherence analysis based on projected standing wave wavelengths. Rather than introducing new dynamical laws or additional physical dimensions, the complex space is employed as an interpretational framework that renders wave like and particle like aspects as complementary projections of a single underlying motion. The results suggest a unified geometric perspective on wave particle duality, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>Majorana stars, the $2S$ spin coherent states that are orthogonal to a spin-$S$ state, offer an elegant method to visualize quantum states. This representation offers deep insights into the structure, symmetries, and entanglement properties of quantum states, bridging abstract algebraic formulations with intuitive geometrical intuition. In this paper, we briefly survey the development and applications of the Majorana constellation, exploring its relevance in modern areas of quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Polaron-Polaritons in Subwavelength Arrays of Trapped Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Lukas Wangler, David Castells-Graells, J. Ignacio Cirac, Ana Asenjo-Garcia, Daniel Malz, Cosimo C. Rusconi</p>
            <p>Subwavelength arrays of atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezers are inherently susceptible to deformations: Optomechanical forces produce lattice distortions, which, in turn, modify the optical response of the array. We show that this coupling hybridizes collective atomic excitations (polaritons) with phonons, forming polaron-polaritons -- the fundamental quasiparticles governing light-matter interactions in arrays of trapped atoms. Using analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations, we show that: (1) phonons can strongly enhance the decay of subradiant states, but also enable their efficient excitation; (2) transport of dark excitations remains remarkably robust even at low trap frequencies, except when a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons; and (3) motion reduces the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, however, we identify mechanisms that mitigate this degradation and restore reflectivity above 99% in some cases. Our findings lay the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to harness them in state-of-the-art experiments.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Casimir effect under the action of gravitational waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo de Oliveira, Thiago Henrique Moreira, Lucas Chibebe Céleri</p>
            <p>Several nontrivial phenomena emerge when a quantum field is subjected to dynamical perturbations, with prominent examples including the Hawking and Unruh effects, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. In this work, we compute the number of particles produced via the dynamical Casimir effect in an ideal cavity, where one of the mirrors is allowed to move under the influence of a gravitational wave. Assuming an oscillatory mirror motion and a plane gravitational wave, we identify the resonance conditions that lead to an exponential increase in the number of created particles through parametric amplification.</p>

            <h2>Sampling methods to describe superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Eyles, Emmanuel Lassalle, Adam Stokes, Ramón Paniagua-Domínguez, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon in which coherence between emitters results in enhanced and directional radiative emission. Many quantum optical phenomena can be characterized by the two-time quantum correlation function $g^{(2)}(t,\tau)$, which describes the photon statistics of emitted radiation. However, the critical task of determining $g^{(2)}(t,\tau)$ becomes intractable for large emitter ensembles due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of emitters. Here, we analyse and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods applicable to emitter arrays embedded within electromagnetic environments, which generally provide upper and lower bounds for $g^{(2)}(t,0)$. We also introduce corrections to these methods (termed offset corrections) that significantly improve the quality of the predictions. The optimal choice of method depends on the total number of emitters, such that taken together, the two approaches provide accurate descriptions across a broad range of important regimes. This work therefore provides new theoretical tools for studying the well-known yet complex phenomenon of superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters.</p>

            <h2>Cooperative Emission from Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Khanonkin, Amir Sivan, Le Liu, Johannes Eberle, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Gadi Eisenstein, Meir Orenstein</p>
            <p>Collective light emission from many-body quantum systems is a cornerstone of quantum optics, yet its implementation in solid-state platforms operating under ambient conditions remains highly challenging. Large-bandgap van der Waals materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) host stable room-temperature single-photon emitters with narrow linewidths across a broad spectral range. However, cooperative radiative effects in this system have not been previously explored. Here we demonstrate collective emission from quantum-emitter ensembles in hBN layers when the emitters are nearly indistinguishable and positioned within a sub-wavelength proximity. Using confocal microscopy and a Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) configuration, we identify both isolated emitters and ensembles activated by localized electron-beam irradiation. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a superlinear intensity enhancement and a pronounced acceleration of the radiative decay in tightly confined ensembles, with lifetimes approaching the temporal resolution of our experimental system (about 500 ps), compared to approximately 1.85 ns for single emitters or large, spatially extended ensembles. Complementary second-order photon-correlation measurements exhibit sub-Poissonian antidip consistent with emission from a few indistinguishable emitters. The simultaneous observation of lifetime shortening and enhanced emission provides direct evidence of cooperative emission at room temperature, achieved without optical cavities or cryogenic cooling. These results establish optically active defect ensembles in hBN as a scalable solid-state platform for engineered collective quantum optics in two-dimensional materials, opening avenues toward ultrabright superradiant light sources and nonclassical photonic states for quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Non-secular polariton leakage and dark-state protection in hybrid plasmonic cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Vallone</p>
            <p>A major issue in exploiting plasmonic cavities as key components in nanotechnology is the effect of radiative and absorption losses on their electrodynamic behavior. Treating them as open-systems, we derive a time-local, completely positive master equation that retains non-secular interference between decay pathways and reduces to the standard secular description when the environment resolves polariton splitting. When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects.</p>

            <h2>Holographic Entanglement Propagation Through Wormholes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Doi, Liang Li, Ung Nguyen, Tadashi Takayanagi</p>
            <p>We study how energy and quantum entanglement are transferred when two identical CFTs are entangled locally. This is probed by considering a local operator insertion in one of the CFTs. When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation. We also find that this leads to a phenomenon opposite to scrambling, where mutual information, instead of being suppressed, gets enhanced by the insertion of a local operator excitation.</p>

            <h2>Non-invertible translation from Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Oishi, Takuma Saito, Hiromi Ebisu</p>
            <p>Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Quotient geometry of tensor ring decomposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Gao, Renfeng Peng, Ya-xiang Yuan</p>
            <p>Differential geometries derived from tensor decompositions have been extensively studied and provided the foundations for a variety of efficient numerical methods. Despite the practical success of the tensor ring (TR) decomposition, its intrinsic geometry remains less understood, primarily due to the underlying ring structure and the resulting nontrivial gauge invariance. We establish the quotient geometry of TR decomposition by imposing full-rank conditions on all unfolding matrices of the core tensors and capturing the gauge invariance. Additionally, the results can be extended to the uniform TR decomposition, where all core tensors are identical. Numerical experiments validate the developed geometries via tensor ring completion tasks.</p>

            <h2>Bound-state-free Förster resonant shielding of strongly dipolar ultracold molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reuben R. W. Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a method to suppress collisional loss in strongly dipolar, rotationally excited ultracold molecules using a combination of static (dc) and microwave (ac) electric fields. By tuning two excited pair molecular rotational states into a Förster resonance with a dc field, simultaneously driving excited rotational transitions with an ac field removes all long-range bound states, allowing near complete suppression of all two- and three-body collisional loss channels. While permitting tunable dipolar and anti-dipolar interactions, this bound-state-free ac/dc scheme is not subject to photon-changing collisions that are the primary source of two-body loss in shielding with two microwave fields, used to achieve the first molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Using NaCs as a representative example for strongly dipolar molecules, close-coupling calculations are performed to show that bound-state-free shielding can achieve ratios of elastic-to-loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ at 100 nK, with currently accessible ac and dc field generation technologies. This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions.</p>

            <h2>Photon triplets from integrated microrings: A path towards deterministic non-Gaussianity on a chip</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel E. Fontaine, J. E. Sipe, Marco Liscidini, Milica Banic</p>
            <p>We propose cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in microring resonators as a scalable and efficient approach for directly generating non-Gaussian states of light. Focusing on the well-understood "low-gain" regime, we demonstrate that triplet generation through cascaded SFWM can be achieved with high efficiency and favorable spectral characteristics using realistic microring sources in AlGaAs. The ability to achieve the generation of light in a single set of supermodes -- and the predicted accessibility of the "high-gain" regime at realistic pump powers -- makes this source a promising candidate as a direct and deterministic source of non-Gaussian light for photonic quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Implementation of Leaking Quantum Walks on a Photonic Processor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Stefanutti, J. Philipps, J. Buetow, A. Guidara, M. Nuvoli, A. Chiuri, L. Sansoni</p>
            <p>Quantum walks (QWs) represent pillars of quantum dynamics and information processing. They provide a powerful framework for simulating quantum transport, designing search algorithms, and enabling universal quantum computation. Several physical platforms have been employed for their implementation, such as trapped atoms and ions, nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and photonic quantum architectures either in bulk optics or waveguide structures and fiber-loop networks. Here we focus on the most promising and versatile approach, that is photonic integrated circuits. In this work, we review how the employment of this versatile experimental platform has allowed to explore several phenomena related to QW-based protocols as, for instance, the evolution in presence of different kinds of noise. In this landscape, to the best of our knowledge, few examples report on the introduction of absorbing centers and their effects on the coherence of the dynamics. Here we present and discuss the results related to absorbing boundaries in QWs obtained through theoretical simulations and experiments conducted with the universal photonic quantum processors realized by Quix Quantum. We analyze how localized absorption along one lattice edge affects the walker dynamics depending on both the leakage probability and the initial injection site. Our results show that the presence of controlled losses modifies interference patterns and coherence, without fully destroying quantum features and providing an effective resource for engineering on-chip QWs and simulating open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nima Leclerc, Chris Miller, Nicholas Brawand</p>
            <p>Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</p>

            <p>Two-photon light-matter interactions exhibit distinctive features such as spectral collapse. The two-photon Dicke model has been reported to exhibit a superradiant phase which could be useful in quantum applications. Here we show that this superradiant phase is not a genuine thermodynamic phase but a finite-size effect. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains. Our results clarify the nature of superradiant conditions in two-photon systems and constrain its realization in quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Foundry-Enabled Patterning of Diamond Quantum Microchiplets for Scalable Quantum Photonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jawaher Almutlaq, Alessandro Buzzi, Anders Khaykin, Linsen Li, William Yzaguirre, Maxim Sirotin, Gerald Gilbert, Genevieve Clark, Dirk Englund</p>
            <p>Quantum technologies promise secure communication networks and powerful new forms of information processing, but building these systems at scale remains a major challenge. Diamond is an especially attractive material for quantum devices because it can host atomic-scale defects that emit single photons and store quantum information with exceptional stability. However, fabricating the optical structures needed to control light in diamond typically relies on slow, bespoke processes that are difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing. These masks define large arrays of nanoscale optical structures, shifting the most demanding pattern-definition steps away from the diamond substrate, improving uniformity, yield, and throughput. Using this method, we demonstrate hundreds of diamond "quantum microchiplets" with improved optical performance and controlled interaction with quantum emitters. The chiplet format allows defective devices to be replaced and enables integration with existing photonic and electronic circuits. Our results show that high-quality diamond quantum devices can be produced using scalable, foundry-compatible techniques. This approach provides a practical pathway toward large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies built on established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Channels on Graphs: a Resonant Tunneling Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Catalano, Farzad Kianvash, Vittorio Giovannetti</p>
            <p>Quantum transport on structured networks is strongly influenced by interference effects, which can dramatically modify how information propagates through a system. We develop a quantum-information-theoretic framework for scattering on graphs in which a full network of connected scattering sites is treated as a quantum channel linking designated input and output ports. Using the Redheffer star product to construct global scattering matrices from local ones, we identify resonant concatenation, a nonlinear composition rule generated by internal back-reflections. In contrast to ordinary channel concatenation, resonant concatenation can suppress noise and even produce super-activation of the quantum capacity, yielding positive capacity in configurations where each constituent channel individually has zero capacity. We illustrate these effects through models exhibiting resonant-tunneling-enhanced transport. Our approach provides a general methodology for analyzing coherent information flow in quantum graphs, with relevance for quantum communication, control, and simulation in structured environments.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Photonic Approach to Graph Coloring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesua Epequin, Pascale Bendotti, Joseph Mikael</p>
            <p>Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a quantum computational model that leverages linear optics to solve sampling problems believed to be classically intractable. Recent experimental breakthroughs have demonstrated quantum advantage using GBS, motivating its application to real-world combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we reformulate the graph coloring problem as an integer programming problem using the independent set formulation. This enables the use of GBS to identify cliques in the complement graph, which correspond to independent sets in the original graph. Our method is benchmarked against classical heuristics and exact algorithms on two sets of instances: Erdős-Rényi random graphs and graphs derived from a smart-charging use case. The results demonstrate that GBS can provide competitive solutions, highlighting its potential as a quantum-enhanced heuristic for graph-based optimization.</p>

            <h2>Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Spectra of Ladder Four-Level System with Quantum Frequency Mixing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Xian Xiao, Tao Wang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we generalized the quantum frequency mixing technology to a ladder-type four-level system and studied its effect on electromagnetically induced transparency spectra. We found a secondary splitting of Autler-Townes splitting in the probing field transmission spectra, which could be understood by the effective Hamiltonian derived with multi-mode Floquet theory. The Frequency mixing scheme developed here enables continuous tunablity of the resonant frequency between upper levels, which facilitates the broad band sensing of AC field. Furthermore, by introducing an additional periodic driving, we realize an effective model that two distinct quantum interference effects coexist: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference arising from closed coherent pathways. Both interference effects could be read out from the transmission spectra independently. The changing of the distance between double splitting peaks represents the interference of Floquet channels, while their asymmetric linewidth broadening is linked with the total effective phase of the loop. This not only provides complementary readout for extracting the phase of AC field, but also establishes a new paradigm for coherent control in multi-level quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid Jump-Diffusion Model for Coherent Optical Control of Quantum Emitters in hBN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saifian Farooq Bhat, Michael K. Koch, Sachin Negi, Alexander Kubanek, Vibhav Bharadwaj</p>
            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional host for stable single-photon emission owing to its wide bandgap, high photostability, and compatibility with nanophotonic integration. We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $\gamma_{\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\mathrm{crit}} \approx 25.91$~K. This hybrid framework provides a quantitative connection between accessible spectroscopic observables and the dominant noise mechanisms limiting coherent optical control in mechanically decoupled quantum emitters, exemplified in hBN and generalizable to similar emitters in other materials.</p>

            <p>Nonclassical states of light and their correlations lie at the heart of quantum optics, serving as fundamental resources that underpin both the exploration of quantum phenomena and the realisation of quantum information protocols. These lecture notes provide an accessible yet rigorous introduction to the foundations of quantum optics, emphasising their relevance to quantum information science and technology. Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of light. Key families of states -- thermal, coherent, and squeezed -- are introduced as paradigmatic examples illustrating the transition from classical to nonclassical behaviour. The concepts of convexity, classicality, and quasiprobability representations are presented as complementary tools for characterising quantumness and defining operational notions such as P-nonclassicality. The discussion extends naturally to Gaussian states, composite systems, and continuous-variable entanglement, highlighting how nonclassicality serves as a resource for generating and quantifying quantum correlations. Theoretical developments are complemented by computational and experimental perspectives, including simulations of optical states using the Python library Strawberry Fields and data analysis from simulated data. Together, these notes aim to bridge the foundational concepts of quantum optics and modern quantum information, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for students and researchers entering the field.</p>

            <h2>Entangled photon pair excitation and time-frequency filtered multidimensional photon correlation spectroscopy as a probe for dissipative exciton kinetics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arunangshu Debnath, Shaul Mukamel</p>
            <p>In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. It can alleviate bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, circumventing transport in mediating states. The distributions thus created can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting, and the pathways contributing to photon emission events can be classified by tuning filtering parameters. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources and multidimensional photon counting allow promising applications to spectroscopy and sensing.</p>

Under these conditions, we show that the three-particle system exhibits infinitely many negative eigenvalues which accumulate at zero and satisfy the universal geometrical law characterising the Efimov effect.

            <p>Long spin coherence times of carriers are essential for implementing quantum technologies using semiconductor devices for which, however, a possible obstacle is spin relaxation. For the spin dynamics, decisive features are the band structure, crystal symmetry, and quantum confinement. Perovskite semiconductors recently have come into focus of studies of their spin states, notivated by efficient optical access and potentially long-living coherence. Here, we report an electron spin coherence time $T_2$ of the order of 1 ms, measured for a bulk FA$_{0.95}$Cs$_{0.05}$PbI$_3$ lead halide perovskite crystal. Using periodic laser pulses, we synchronize the electron spin Larmor precession about an external magnetic field in an inhomogeneous ensemble, the effect known as spin mode locking. It appears as a decay of the optically created ensemble spin polarization within the dephasing time $T_2^*$ of up to 20 ns and its revival during the spin coherence time $T_2$ reaching the millisecond range. This exceptionally long spin coherence time in a bulk crystal is complemented by millisecond-long longitudinal spin relaxation times $T_1$ for electrons and holes, measured by optically-detected magnetic resonance. These long-lasting spin dynamics highlight perovskites as promising platform for the quantum devices with all-optical control.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite quantum states over time from two fundamental assumptions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seok Hyung Lie, James Fullwood</p>
            <p>The theory of quantum states over time extends the density operator formalism into the temporal domain, providing a unified of treatment of timelike and spacelike separated systems in quantum theory. Although recent results have characterized quantum states over time involving two timelike separated systems, it remains unclear how to consistently extend the notion of quantum states over time to multipartite temporal scenarios, such as those considered in studies of Leggett-Garg inequalities. In this Letter, we show that two simple assumptions uniquely single out the Markovian multipartite extension of bipartite quantum states over time, namely, linearity in the initial state and a quantum analog of conditionability for multipartite probability distributions. As a direct consequence of our result, we establish a canonical correspondence between multipartite QSOTs and Kirkwood-Dirac type quasiprobability distributions, which we show opens up the possibility of experimentally verifying the temporal correlations encoded in QSOTs via the recent experimental technique of simulating quasiprobability known as quantum snapshotting.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the first violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality and time-order noninvariance on public quantum computers using genuine noninvasive measurements. By gathering sufficiently large statistics, we have been able to violate Leggett-Garg inequality and time-order invariance. The detailed analysis of the data on 10 qubit sets from 5 devices available on IBM Quantum and one on IonQ reveals violations beyond 5 standard deviations in almost all cases. We implemented our protocols using fractional gates, newly available on the IBM Heron devices, allowing us to benchmark them in application to weak measurements. The noninvasiveness is supported by a qualitative and quantitative agreement with the model of weak disturbance. Moreover, our data expose statistically significant deviations from theoretical predictions that exceed declared device error rates, establishing weak measurement protocols as a sensitive benchmark for quantum hardware. These advances transform public quantum computers into practical testbeds for probing foundational questions of realism and temporal order with unprecedented accessibility and precision.</p>

            <h2>Engineering quantum Mpemba effect by Liouvillian skin effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zhang, Chen Sun, Fuxiang Li</p>
            <p>We propose a novel approach to engineer the quantum Mpemba effect (QME)-wherein an initial state farther from the steaty state relaxes faster than a closer one-by the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE) in open quantum systems. We show that, in the open quantum chain with LSE, QME can be easily realized by considering only the spatial profile of initial states, since the initial states localized on the left or right edges experience distinctive relaxation process (algebraic or exponential decay). This approach circumvents the necessity of careful initial-state design and fine-tuning of control parameter. Moreover, when the initial correlation matrix contains off-diagonal elements, we uncover a new kind of QME which manifest as two crossings in the Hilbert-Schmidt distance at different times. This work unveils the deep connection between QME and LSE, and provides a physically intuitive understanding of QME and straightforward pathway for the initial state preparation thereby enabling readily accessible experimental preparation.</p>

            <h2>Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu Li, Xiao-Han Yang, Xiao-Yu Dong</p>
            <p>The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Effects of quantum geometry on the decoherence induced by black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Joseph Fahn, Alessandro Pesci</p>
            <p>Recently, it has been shown that a quantum system held in spatial superposition and then eventually recombined does experience decoherence from black hole horizons, at a level increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. In this, the effects of the horizon have been derived using a classical spacetime picture for the latter. In the present note we point out that quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the quantum black hole could significantly affect the results. In a specific effective implementation of the quantum geometry in terms of a minimal length and ensuing minimal area, it appears in particular that, for selected values of the quantum of area proposed on various grounds in the literature, the decoherence induced by the horizon turns out to be limited to negligibly small values.</p>

            <h2>Horizon quantum geometries and decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Joseph Fahn, Alessandro Pesci</p>
            <p>There is mounting theoretical evidence that black hole horizons induce decoherence on a quantum system, say a particle, put in a superposition of locations, with the decoherence functional, evaluated after closure of the superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes, that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area $A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of the Polaron-Molecule Transition on a NISQ Device</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Catala, Ezequiel Valero, German Rodrigo</p>
            <p>The simulation of strongly correlated fermionic systems remains one of the most significant challenges in computational physics due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the fermionic sign problem. In this work, we present a digital quantum simulation framework to explore the Fermi polaron and the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover. We develop a unified Hamiltonian formalism that bridges pairing superfluidity and impurity physics, mapping the system onto a gate-based quantum processor via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Using a first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, we implement a Ramsey interferometry protocol to extract the real-time dynamics and spectral response of the system. Our results demonstrate a smooth transition from a dressed quasiparticle (polaron) regime to a stable molecular bound state, characterized by a linear energy renormalization in the strong-coupling limit. We validate our simulation against exact classical benchmarks and report successful execution on the Barcelona Supercomputing Center quantum hardware. Despite the inherent noise of the quantum hardware, the hybrid variational approach shows remarkable resilience, accurately capturing the bifurcation of the spectral density</p>

            <h2>Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian for ab initio hybrid quantum-classical molecular design with applications to photodynamic therapy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil Zak</p>
            <p>Relativistic spin effects drive subtle molecular phenomena ranging from intersystem crossing in photodynamic therapy to spin-mediated catalysis and high-resolution spectroscopy. These effects are described by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian, which extends the nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian by including one- and two-electron spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions. First-principles simulations of the full Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian rapidly become intractable on classical computers due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the complexity of two-body spin-dependent terms. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing molecular energy levels and properties governed by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian. Our approach block-encodes the relativistic Hamiltonian in a second-quantized, doubly factorized representation. By reformulating the Hamiltonian in a symmetry-adapted Majorana basis, we construct efficient linear-combination-of-unitaries circuits that encode spin-orbit interactions without effective or mean-field approximations. We introduce spin-controlled Pauli-SWAP networks that decouple spin and orbital control logic, enabling a unified treatment of relativistic spin mixing with only modest overhead relative to spin-free simulations. We analyze quantum resources in terms of logical qubits and T-gate complexity, showing that explicit spin degrees of freedom do not worsen the asymptotic scaling. The prefactor is reduced by a factor of two compared to direct linear-combination-of-unitaries approaches. Finally, we outline a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for designing photodynamic therapy photosensitizers, artificial photosynthesis catalysts, and other systems where accurate relativistic spin effects are essential.</p>

            <h2>Complete transparency with three active-passive-coupled optical resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Bo Yan, Liu Yang, Bing He</p>
            <p>The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.</p>

Assuming a generic setting, the electron spin of each node acts as the communication qubit and may be entangled with other nodes, e.g., through a spin-photon interface. The generally available Ising component of the hyperfine interaction is shown to facilitate repeated entanglement transfer onto memory qudits of arbitrary dimension $d\le 2I+1$ with $I$ the nuclear spin quantum number. When $d$ is set to an integer power of two, maximal entanglement can be generated deterministically and without intermittent driving of nuclear spins. The scheme is applicable to several candidate systems, including the $^{73}$Ge germanium vacancy in diamond.</p>

Our results show that variational methods, while being the most heuristic, still require substantially fewer overall resources on quantum hardware, and could feasibly address such problems on current or near-future devices.

            <p>The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model that describes diverse complex phenomena in nature. However, simulating the NLSE on a quantum computer is inherently challenging due to the presence of the nonlinear term. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating the NLSE based on the split-step Fourier method. During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions. This work provide a concrete basis for analyzing accuracy-cost trade-offs in quantum-classical simulations of nonlinear dispersive wave dynamics.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for fast, robust and high-fidelity topological quantum state transfer in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings, motivated by chains of Rydberg atoms with dipole-dipole interactions. Such long-range interactions naturally give rise to extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models supporting topologically protected edge states. We show that these edge states enable high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer using both time-independent protocols, based on coherent edge state dynamics, and time-dependent protocols, based on adiabatic modulation of system parameters. Long-range couplings play a central role by enhancing the relevant energy gaps, leading to a substantial improvement in transfer efficiency compared to nearest neighbour models. The resulting transfer is robust against positional disorder, reflecting its topological origin and highlighting the potential of long-range interacting platforms for reliable quantum state transfer.</p>

            <p>Advances in quantum technologies are accelerating the demand for optical quantum state sensors that combine high precision, versatility, and scalability within a unified hardware platform. Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/\gamma \approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes. By reducing reliance on material nonlinearity and reservoir size, the proposed approach facilitates the practical deployment of high-fidelity photonic quantum sensors on existing integrated platforms, paving the way toward chip-scale quantum processors and photonic sensing technologies.</p>

            <p>The minimum error probability for distinguishing between two quantum states is bounded by the Helstrom limit, derived under the assumption that measurement strategies are restricted to positive operator-valued measurements. We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, indicating the use of measurement operations that go beyond the standard positive operator-valued measurements framework. We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination. Interestingly, even initial product states can give rise to effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem, and achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination error when discriminating quantum states of the subsystem.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate direct, non-invasive and non-contact detection of human cardiac magnetic signals using quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Three configurations were employed recording magnetocardiography (MCG) signals in various shielded and unshielded environments. The signals were averaged over a few hundreds up to several thousands of heart beats to detect the MCG traces. The compact room-temperature NV sensors exhibit sensitivities of 6-26 pT/Hz^(1/2) with active sensing volumes below 0.5 mm^3, defining the performance level of the demonstrated MCG measurements. While the present signals are obtained by averaging, this performance already indicates a clear path toward single-shot MCG sensing. To move beyond shielded environments toward practical clinical use, strong noise suppression is required. To this end, we implement NV-based gradiometry and achieve efficient common-mode noise rejection, enabled by the intrinsically small sensing volume of NV sensors. Together, these multi-platform results obtained across diverse magnetic environments provide a solid foundation for translating quantum sensors into human medical diagnostics such as MCG and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</p>

            <p>Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</p>

We implement dual-tone heterodyne detection, achieving a minimum detectable field strength on the order of uV/cm and a sensitivity in the sub-uV/cm/Hz^1/2 regime, while extending the operational bandwidth up to 3 GHz. Through systematic characterization of frequency and power dependencies, we identify optimal operating conditions to minimize power broadening in the resonant AT regime and maximize sensitivity in the far-off-resonance AC Stark regime.

Since attention computations account for the primary computational overhead in both model inference and training, efficiently computing attention matrices has become one of the core challenges in accelerating large language models. It is well-known that quantum machines possess computational advantages over classical machines, and the role of quantum computing in LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on leveraging the Grover search algorithm to efficiently compute a sparse attention matrix. Through comparisons with classical algorithms, we demonstrate that our method achieves quantum acceleration in polynomial time. Additionally, we observe that the generated quantum attention matrices naturally exhibit low-rank structures, providing further theoretical support for efficient modeling. Moreover, within the specific context of attention matrix computation, we conduct a systematic and detailed analysis of the error and time complexity of the proposed algorithm.</p>

            <p>Solid state defects such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been utilized for NMR sensing at ambient temperatures for samples at the nano-scale and up to the micro-scale. Similar to standard NMR, NV-sensitivities can be increased using tesla-valued magnetic fields to boost nuclear thermal polarization, while structural parameters, such as chemical shifts, are also enhanced. However, with standard microwave (MW) based sensing techniques, NV centers struggle to track fast megahertz Larmor frequencies encountered in high-field scenarios. Previous protocols have addressed this by mapping target NMR parameters to the signal amplitude rather than the frequency, using a mediating RF field. Although successful, protocol sensitivities are limited by the coherence time ($T_2^*$) of the NMR signal owing to the presence of stages where the sample magnetization freely evolves. In this work, we propose extending this coherence time, and consequently improving sensitivity, via amplitude encoding with weak nuclear spin locking instead of free evolution, thereby taking advantage of the longer sample coherence times ($T_{1\rho}$). We demonstrate this can enhance protocol sensitivities by $\gtrsim 4$ times.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems have attracted considerable interest over the last few decades due to their unique spectral and dynamical properties not encountered in Hermitian counterparts. An intensely debated question is whether non-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are operated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current analysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for Hermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space metric is intrinsically parameter dependent. Here, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) defined on the deformed Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This covariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a consistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the covariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems is dual to the ordinary QFI of corresponding Hermitian systems. Importantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the covariant QFI and allows one to identify optimal projections which saturate the corresponding classical Fisher information to this ultimate limit. The developed framework also enables to set the criteria under which pseudo-Hermitian sensors can exhibit an advantage over their Hermitian counterparts of the same dimensionality.</p>

            <h2>General many-body entanglement swapping protocol: opportunities for distributed quantum computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Santeri Huhtanen, Yousef Mafi, Ali G. Moghaddam, Teemu Ojanen</p>
            <p>Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. Moreover, we demonstrate how the three-party protocol can be generalized to many-body swapping networks, enabling a general many-body state sharing with unit fidelity via arbitrary number of intermediate nodes. This is achieved by replacing all but one of the unitary operations with those corresponding to the same Schmidt states but with a flattened spectrum, which also completely eliminates the need for postselection. We provide a proof of concept of the three-party protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as fault-tolerant entanglement swapping and new strategies for distributed quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boris Gurevich, Weihua Xie, Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Michael H. Kolodrubetz</p>
            <p>We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.</p>

            <h2>Construction and Rigorous Analysis of Quantum-Like States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Dickey, Abhijeet Vyas, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>Extending upon the observations of the emergence of quantum-like states from classical complex synchronized networks, this work adds mathematical rigor to the analysis of single Quantum-Like (QL) bits constructed by eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of such networks. First, we rigorously show that symmetric construction of such networks (regular undirected/symmetric bipartite graph $G_C$ connecting two regular undirected subgraphs $G_A,\,G_B$) leads to an equal superposition of the $|+\rangle, |-\rangle$ Hadamard states (with basis $|0\rangle,\,|1\rangle$ set from eigenvectors of the subgraphs), and provide an analysis of sufficient conditions on the network for construction of such states. Second, we prove two methods to construct any arbitrary single qubit state $|\psi\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle,\, |a|^2+|b|^2=1$ and provide a switching lemma for the boundaries of both methods. The first method of construction is by detuning the regularities of the two subgraphs and the second is by asymmetrically constructing the bipartite connection matrix $C$ by allowing it to be directed, and then detuning those regularities. While the intuition is derived from the motivation of using complex synchronized networks for quantum information storage and computations, the proofs for constructing eigenvectors that interact in a quantum-like fashion only require the structure of the graph embedded in the adjacency matrix. Practically, this means that synchronization is not important to creating quantum-like bits, only that the edge weights are generally unit or close to unit and that the subgraphs are regular. As such, the results on combinations of random k-regular graphs (precisely Erdős-Rényi graphs) may be independently interesting.</p>

            <p>Quantum algorithms based on classical processing of individual samples have recently emerged as the most effective and robust methods to approximate ground-state wave functions of many-body quantum systems on pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In these algorithms, the quantum computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. The recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is well approximated by a polynomial subset of the full Hilbert space. However, implementations of SKQD for complex many-body Hamiltonians, such as quantum chemistry ones, are limited by the depths of time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. In this work, we introduce a method that combines SKQD with a qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables quantum chemistry experiments on quantum processors, while preserving the convergence guarantees similar to the phase estimation algorithm. We demonstrate its viability by applying SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.</p>

            <p>We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranav Kulkarni, Leo Sünkel, Michael Kölle</p>
            <p>Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link.</p>

Comparing with traditional superconducting quantum interference device which requires at least $2$-dimensional circuits, the synthetic dimensional superconducting quantum interference device can be realized only in $1$-dimensional circuits. The synthetic dimensional system is composed of Bose-Einstein condensate in two neighboring optical wells which is coupled to an external coherent light. Control parameter for the qubit is naturally provided by artificial magnetic flux originated from the coherent atom-light coupling.

            <p>Superpositions between states in doubly degenerate Kramers pairs can act as an internal degree of freedom. Here we uncover a Kramers dichroism in PT symmetric magnets: interband transitions induced by circularly polarized light irradiation produce a coherent superposition between Kramers partnered states. This allows to optically control the Kramers degree of freedom. In contrast, Kramers pairs optically excited by linearly polarized light remain in a completely mixed state. Strikingly, we find a class of second-order nonlinear responses that directly track the coherence between Kramers partnered states. Such Kramers nonlinearities can be pronounced producing large second-order nonlinear layer polarization responses activated by Kramers degeneracy in layered antiferromagnets. Together with Kramers dichroism, these render optical responses a novel means for accessing the Kramers degree of freedom and diagnosing their quantum coherent state.</p>

            <p>Only recently the concept of achronal localization has been developed as the adequate frame for the description of the localizability of a relativistic quantum mechanical system. Here covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method is applied to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. As (covariant) achronal localizations correspond one-to-one to (covariant) representations of the causal logic, thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly a covariant family of representations of the causal logic is derived from the stress-energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. The construction of an achronal localization from a conserved current relies on a version of the divergence theorem for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary. This result is stated and proved in this work.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations.

We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of the dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information-theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.</p>

In the USC regime, where the ratio of the atom-cavity coupling strength to the cavity resonance frequency exceeds 0.1, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles known as polaritons emerge. By employing modified second- and third-order correlation functions appropriate for the USC regime, we predict the emergence of 2PB, characterized by pronounced two-polariton bunching accompanied by suppressed three-polariton coincidences. This Letter introduces a novel route to achieving 2PB, with promising implications for the realization of multiparticle quantum light sources in the USC regime.</p>

            <p>Quantum interferometers offer phase measurement capabilities that surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), with phase sensitivity and quantum enhancement factor serving as key performance metrics. However, practical implementations face severe degradation of both metrics due to unavoidable losses, representing the foremost challenge in advancing quantum interferometry toward real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent-amplifier-empowered quantum interferometer. The coherent amplifier dramatically suppresses the decay of both sensitivity and quantum enhancement under high-loss conditions, maintaining phase sensitivity beyond the original SQL even for losses exceeding 90%. Using an injected 4.2 dB squeezed-vacuum state in experimental demonstration, our scheme reduces the quantum enhancement degradation under 90% loss from 3.7 dB in a conventional quantum interferometer (CQI) to only 1.5 dB. More importantly, the phase sensitivity degradation under the same loss is limited to 4.0 dB, markedly outperforming the 11.2 dB degradation observed in a CQI. This improvement is enabled by the coherent amplifier's phase-sensitive photon amplification and its protection of the quantum state. This breakthrough in amplifier-empowered quantum interferometry overcomes the critical barrier to practical deployment, enabling robust quantum-enhanced measurements in lossy environments.</p>

            <p>The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect highlights the fundamental role of electromagnetic potentials in quantum mechanics, manifesting as a phase shift for a charged particle in field-free regions. While well-established for static magnetic fluxes, the effect's behavior under time-varying fluxes remains an open and debated question. Employing the WKB method, we derive the AB phase shift for a time-dependent magnetic vector potential, demonstrating that for circular paths in the quasistatic regime, it is proportional to the time-averaged enclosed magnetic flux, \(\Delta \phi_{\rm AB} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T e \Phi(t) \, dt\), with the total phase shift, including kinetic contributions, equaling \(e \Phi(0)\). For non-circular paths, the phase shift depends on both the flux history and path geometry, revealing the effect's hybrid nature involving gauge potentials and induced electric fields. We verify the consistency of our gauge choice with Maxwell's equations and discuss the implications for local versus nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect. We also generalize the results to scenarios with nonzero external magnetic fields, where the enclosed flux is through the actual electron paths, and for circular paths of radius $R$, the AB phase shift is also proportional to the time average of the enclosed flux \(\Phi_{\rm enc}(R,t)\), with the total phase shift depending only on the initial enclosed flux \(e \Phi_{\rm enc}(R,0)\); for general non-circular paths, the external magnetic field affects trajectories and phase accumulation through the Lorentz force, leading to additional path dependence. These findings clarify the role of gauge-dependent potentials and induced fields in the generalized AB effect, offering new theoretical insights and potential applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) relies on Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes to reach error rates necessary for large scale quantum applications. At a physical level, QEC codes perform parity checks on data qubits, producing syndrome information, through Syndrome Measurement (SM) circuits. These circuits define a code's logical error rate and must be run repeatedly throughout the entire program. The performance of SM circuits is therefore critical to the success of a FTQC system. While ultimately implemented as physical circuits, SM circuits have challenges that are not addressed by existing circuit optimization tools. Importantly, inside SM circuits themselves errors are expected to occur, and how errors propagate through SM circuits directly impacts which errors are detectable and correctable, defining the code's logical error rate. This is not modeled in NISQ-era tools, which instead optimize for targets such as gate depth or gate count to mitigate the chance that any error occurs. This gap leaves key questions unanswered about the expected real-world effectiveness of QEC codes. In this work we address this gap and present PropHunt, an automated tool for optimizing SM circuits for CSS codes. We evaluate PropHunt on a suite of relevant QEC codes and demonstrate PropHunt's ability to iteratively improve performance and recover existing hand-designed circuits automatically. We also propose a near-term QEC application, Hook-ZNE, which leverages PropHunt's fine-grained control over logical error rate to improve Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), a promising error mitigation strategy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudraksh Sharma</p>
            <p>The quantum phase transitions provide a paradigm for studying collective quantum phenomena that are a result of competing non-commuting interactions. This paper will study the ground state properties and quantum critical dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model through a combined perspective that includes exact diagonalisation, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulations, and simulations on realistic physical quantum devices. We focus on a lattice of four spins, where we calculate the ground-state energies, magnetic order parameters and correlation functions at uniformly applied conditions, which is repeated by all systems. Precise diagonalisation provides both a benchmark, which is symmetry-conserving, and a depth-two, physics inspired variational approximation, which provides simulations accessible to hardware. The circuits that have been optimised identically are then placed on the IQM Garnet quantum processor, using a resource-efficient batched protocol. We find that the ground-state energies of shallow variational circuits are reliably captured by the circuit over the entire parameter space; the magnetic arrangement parameters and observables sensitive to correlation signal significantly more noise. The error analysis of quantitative analysis reveals a strong broadening of critical crossover on hardware, which is consistent with the noise attenuation of long-range correlations. These findings highlight the current capabilities as well as the fundamental limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems in modelling quantum critical phenomena as a benchmark to future enhancements in obtaining quantum hardware and quantum algorithms development.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors offer significant advantages over classical devices in spatial resolution and sensitivity, enabling transformative applications across materials science, healthcare, and beyond. Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields. In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model. These results are broadly applicable to a wide range of quantum sensing platforms, not limited to single-spin systems, and are particularly valuable for real-time adaptive protocols, where model inaccuracies can otherwise lead to suboptimal control and degraded performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramandeep Dewan</p>
            <p>Decoherence is often modeled using Markovian master equations that predict exponential suppression of coherence and are frequently used as effective bounds on quantum behavior in complex environments. Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case. For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel. These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit. Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data.</p>

            <h2>The Double Covariance Model: A Stochastic Reconstruction of Quantum Entangled States via Interplay of Micro-Macro Time Scales</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei Khrennikov</p>
            <p>This article presents a concrete mathematical framework for the generation of entangled quantum states from classical stochastic processes. We demonstrate that any density operator $\rho_{AB}$ of a composite system can be derived from the correlations between two underlying stochastic processes, $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$, representing the random fluctuations of its subsystems. This construction utilizes a two-scale temporal scheme - micro and macro time - where quantum correlations emerge as macro-correlations derived from underlying micro-correlations. We propose the Double Covariance Model (DCM), which reproduces the fundamental properties of quantum theory by treating the quantum state as the fourth-order moment structure of an underlying classical probability space.</p>

            <h2>LiDMaS: Architecture-Level Modeling of Fault-Tolerant Magic-State Injection in GKP Photonic Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computation in photonic architectures relies on the efficient preparation of high-fidelity logical magic states under realistic constraints imposed by finite squeezing and photon loss. In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity. These results provide quantitative design guidance for scalable photonic fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. We realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform a myriad of quantum protocols. With simple pulse sequences, we explore many-body dynamics and generate a variety of entangled states, including GHZ states, 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. The versatility and scalability of QCAs offers compelling routes for scaling quantum information systems with global controls, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert A. Lang, Paarth Jain, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Danial Motlagh</p>
            <p>Non-adiabatic dynamics at molecule-metal interfaces govern diverse and technologically important phenomena, from heterogeneous catalysis to dye-sensitized solar energy conversion and charge transport across molecular junctions. Realistic modeling of such dynamics necessitates taking into account various charge and energy transfer channels involving the coupling of nuclear motion with a very large number of electronic states, leading to prohibitive cost using classical computational methods. In this work we introduce a generalization of the Anderson-Newns Hamiltonian and develop a highly optimized quantum algorithm for simulating the non-adiabatic dynamics of realistic molecule-metal interfaces. Using the PennyLane software platform, we perform resource estimations of our algorithm, showing its remarkably low implementation cost for model systems representative of various scientifically and industrially relevant molecule-metal systems. Specifically, we find that time evolution for models including $100$ metal orbitals, $8$ molecular orbitals, and $20$ nuclear degrees of freedom, requires only $271$ qubits and $7.9 \times 10^7$ Toffoli gates for $1000$ Trotter steps, suggesting non-adiabatic molecule-metal dynamics as a fruitful application of first-generation fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilad Orr, Golan Ben-Ari, Eliran Talker</p>
            <p>We combined experimental and theoretical investigations of an effective two-level atomic system operating in the near-infrared telecom wavelength regime, realized using hot rubidium vapor confined within a sub-micron-thick cell. In this strongly confined geometry, atomic coherence is profoundly influenced by wall-induced relaxation arising from frequent atom-surface collisions. By analyzing both absorption and fluorescence spectra, we demonstrate that the optical response is dominated by a closed cycling transition, which effectively isolates the atomic dynamics to a two-level configuration despite the presence of multiple hyperfine states. This confinement-induced selection suppresses optical pumping into uncoupled states and enables robust, controllable light-matter interaction at telecom wavelengths within a miniature atomic platform. Our results establish a practical route to realizing near-infrared atomic two-level systems in compact vapor-cell devices, opening new opportunities for integrated quantum photonic technologies, including on-chip quantum memories, telecom-band frequency references, and scalable quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.</p>

Moreover, we identify different scalings of the detector system parameters for entanglement inside and outside the light cone.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Ford, Adrien Amour, Matthias Keller</p>
            <p>Control over the internal states of trapped ions makes them the ideal system to generate single and two-photon states. Coupling a single ion to an optical cavity enables efficient emission of single photons into a single spatial mode and grants control over their temporal shape, phase and frequency. Using the long coherence time of the ion's internal states and employing a scheme to protect the coherence of the ion-cavity interaction, we demonstrate the generation of a two-photon entangled state with full control over the phase. Initially, ion-photon entanglement is generated. A second photon is subsequently generated, mapping the ion's state onto the second photon. By adjusting the drive field the phase of the entangled state can be fully controlled. We implement this scheme in the most resource efficient way by utilizing a single $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion coupled to an optical cavity and demonstrate the generation of a two-photon entangled stated with full phase control with a fidelity of up to 82\%.</p>

The protocol combines a new geometric phase gate which can be utilized for exact unitary synthesis on the Dicke subspace, an analytic solution of the noisy quantum channel dynamics and optimal control methods.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Xue, Jacob P. Covey, Matthew Otten</p>
            <p>Quantum chemistry is a promising application of future quantum computers, but the requirements on qubit count and other resources suggest that modular computing architectures will be required. We introduce an implementation of a quantum chemistry algorithm that is distributed across several computational modules: the distributed unitary selective coupled cluster (dUSCC). We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\sim$20$\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be "free" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of "free" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.</p>

            <p>Theoretical analysis demonstrates that a spin qubit in a parabolic quantum wire, when driven by a bichromatic field, exhibits a confinement-tunable synthetic gauge field leading to novel Floquet topological phenomena. The underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations is presented. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, characterized by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. The emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Furthermore, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, such as fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunnelling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Concrete experimental pathways for realizing these effects in semiconductor heterostructures are proposed, and the framework is extended to multi-qubit entanglement generation with a quantitative analysis of its inherent resilience to decoherence. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials as a versatile and scalable platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Precision limit under weak-coupling with ancillary qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Chen, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>We propose a measurement-based quantum metrology protocol in a composite model, where the probe system (a spin ensemble) is coupled to an ancillary two-level system (qubit) with a general Heisenberg XXZ interaction. With an optimized and weak probe-ancilla coupling strength and a proper duration of joint evolution, the two parallel evolution paths of the probe system induced by the unconditional measurement on qubit can transform an eigenstate of the collective angular momentum operator of spin ensemble to be a two-component state with a large distance in eigenspace. The quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system of polarized states or their superposition, that could be relaxed to mixed states, can therefore manifest an exact or asymptotic quadratic scaling with respect to the probe size (spin number) $N$. The quadratic scaling behavior is found to be insensitive to the imperfect encoding operator and coupling strength. By virtue of the parity detection on the ancillary qubit or the probe system, the phase sensitivity can approach the Heisenberg limit. We suggest that the unconditional measurement on qubit could become an efficient resource to replace Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like states and squeezing Hamiltonian for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision.</p>

In this work, we initiate the study of computational quantum capacities. These quantify how much information can be reliably transmitted when imposing the natural requirement that en- and decoding have to be computationally efficient. We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm. Our results demonstrate that the natural requirement of computational efficiency can radically alter the limits of quantum communication.</p>

            <p>Squeezed states of light enable enhanced measurement precision by reducing noise below the standard quantum limit. A key application of squeezed light is nonlinear microscopy, where state-of-the-art performance is limited by photodamage and quantum-limited noise. Such microscopes require bright, pulsed light for optimal operation, yet generating and detecting bright pulsed squeezing at high levels remains challenging. In this work, we present an efficient technique to generate high levels of bright picosecond pulsed squeezed light using a $\chi^2$ optical parametric amplification process in a waveguide. We measure $-3.2~\mathrm{dB}$ of bright squeezing with optical power compatible with nonlinear microscopy, as well as $-3.6~\mathrm{dB}$ of vacuum squeezing. Corrected for losses, these squeezing levels correspond to $-15.4^{+2.7}_{-8.7}~\mathrm{dB}$ of squeezing generated in the waveguide. The measured level of bright amplitude pulsed squeezing is to our knowledge the highest reported to date, and will contribute to the broader adoption of quantum-enhanced nonlinear microscopy in biological studies.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology typically demands the preparation of exotic quantum probe states, such as entangled or squeezed states, to surpass classical limits. However, the need for carefully calibrated system parameters and finely optimized quantum controls imposes limitations on scalability and robustness. Here, we circumvent these limitations by introducing an echoed random process that achieves sensitivity approaching the Heisenberg limit while remaining blind to the random probe state. We demonstrate that by simply driving a Kerr nonlinear mode with random pulses, the emergence of sub-Planck phase-space structures grants high sensitivity, eliminating the need for complex quantum control. The protocol is statistically robust, yielding high performance across broad driving parameter ranges while exhibiting resilience to control fluctuations and photon loss. Broadly applicable to both bosonic and qubit platforms, our work reveals a practical, hardware-efficient, scalable, and optimization-free route to quantum-enhanced metrology in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</p>

            <p>While quantum metrology enables measurement precision beyond classical limits, its performance is often susceptible to experimental imperfections. Most prior studies have focused on imperfections in quantum states and operations. Here, we investigate the effect of coarse graining in quantum measurement through both theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration. Using an interferometer with a squeezed vacuum and a laser input, we analyze how coarse graining in homodyne detection affects the precision of phase estimation. We evaluate the Fisher information under various coarse-graining conditions and determine, in each case, an optimal estimation strategy that saturates the Cramér-Rao bound. Remarkably, even extremely coarse-grained measurement -- with only two bins -- enables phase estimation beyond the standard quantum limit and even achieves a precision that follows the Heisenberg scaling. We experimentally demonstrate quantum-enhanced phase estimation under coarse-grained homodyne detection. To determine an optimal estimation strategy, we employ the method of moments and present calibration procedures that enable its application to general experimental settings. Using only two bins, we observe a quantum enhancement of 1.2 dB compared to the classical method using the ideal measurement, improving towards 3.8 dB as the bin number increases. These results highlight a practical pathway to achieving quantum enhancement under the presence of severe experimental imperfections.</p>

            <p>Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and uncover exotic universal features from a systematic investigation. In particular, we show that for generic bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians, the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding of hard-core bosonic zero modes. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by a nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with and without the aid of a controlled defect, respectively. Analytic and numerical results are given. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to observe these predictions and identify the parameter regimes for the high-fidelity braiding, paving the way for the experimental observation of our results in the near future.</p>

            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols enable two distant parties to communicate with information-theoretically proven secrecy. However, these protocols are generally vulnerable to potential mismatches between the physical modeling and the implementation of their quantum operations, thereby opening opportunities for side channel attacks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD addresses this problem by reducing the degree of device modeling to a black-box setting. The stronger security obtained in this way comes at the cost of a reduced noise tolerance, rendering experimental demonstrations more challenging: so far, only one experiment based on trapped ions was able to successfully generate a secret key. Photonic platforms have however long been preferred for QKD thanks to their suitability to optical fiber transmission, high repetition rates, readily available hardware, and potential for circuit integration. In this work, we assess the feasibility of DIQKD on a photonic circuit recently identified by machine learning techniques. For this, we introduce an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that takes into account full outcome statistics. Our analysis shows that the proposed optical circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization realistic.</p>

Benchmarking ITPP on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model demonstrates that truncation provides a controlled trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, while also revealing challenges associated with operator growth under imaginary time evolution.

            <p>The temporal degree-of-freedom of light is incredibly powerful for modern quantum technologies, enabling large-scale quantum computing architectures and record key-rates in quantum key distribution. However, the generalized measurement of large and complex quantum superpositions of the time-of-arrival of a photon remains a unique experimental challenge. Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization. In addition, these are limited by construction to a restricted set of phase-only superposition measurements. Here we show how the coupling of spatial and temporal information inside a single multi-mode fiber can be harnessed to program completely generalized measurements for high-dimensional superpositions of photonic time-bin. Using the multi-spectral transmission matrix of the fiber, we find special sets of spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays through the fiber. By exciting coherent superpositions of these spatial modes, we engineer the equivalent of large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber and use them to perform high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions in up to dimension 11. The single fiber functions as a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits that significantly eases the experimental overheads of standard approaches based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers, serving as an essential tool for quantum technologies that harness the temporal properties of light.</p>

            <h2>Exotic collective behaviors of giant quantum emitters in two-dimensional baths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing-Yang Qiu, Wen Huang, Lei Du, Xin-You Lü</p>
            <p>Nonlocal light-matter interactions with giant atoms in high-dimensional environments are not only fundamentally intriguing for testing quantum electrodynamics beyond the dipole approximation but also crucial for building high-dimensional quantum networks and engineering multipartite entangled states. Given the enigmatic and largely uncharted collective signatures exhibited by multiple giant atoms within two-dimensional optical baths, we delve into their nonperturbative collective dynamics within the single-excitation subspace, focusing on the case where they are coupled to a common two-dimensional photonic reservoir and employing a resolvent operator approach. We demonstrate that precisely engineered atomic arrangements lead to unconventional quantum dynamics, featuring non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in the continuum, thereby providing a versatile platform for implementing two-dimensional quantum memory. Phenomenologically, we observe the emergence of exotic photon emission patterns in both two- and three-dimensional (3D) baths. The emission directions are shown to be precisely controllable on demand through exact phase engineering of the coupling parameters, enabling a highly efficient chiral light-matter interface. Moreover, our generalization to a 3D bath reveals that coherent dipole-dipole interactions can survive despite the coupling to a continuum of modes, a finding that challenges conventional wisdom regarding decoherence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. P. Teja, Radim Filip</p>
            <p>Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) offers a promising paradigm for photonic quantum computing, but its implementation requires the generation of specific non-Gaussian resource states. While continuous-variable encodings such as the highly complex (GKP) states have been widely studied, the much simpler binomial codes offer an experimentally accessible alternative, though they demand a distinct set of operational tools. Here, we present a toolkit for MBQC using optical binomial codes, detailing a cavity-QED protocol for conditional generation of cluster states and the implementation of Pauli measurements. Our work proposes the first steps for existing optical atom-cavity architectures to lay the groundwork for their use in quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubit networks (SQNs) embedded in a low-dissipative resonator is a promising device allowing one not only to establish the collective quantum dynamics on a macroscopic scale but also to greatly enhance the sensitivity of detectors of microwave photons. A quantum ac Stark effect provided by coupling between an SQN and microwave photons of a resonator, leads to a strong nonlinear interaction between photons. Here, we present a two-tone spectroscopy experiment in which a set of 10 superconducting flux qubits is coupled to the input R- resonator and the output T- transmission line. An external microwave pump field close to the resonance frequency populates macroscopically the resonator mode as a Bose-Einstein condensate, while a second probe beam scans the resonances referred also as Bogoliubov-like excitations. The corresponding excitation frequency measured from the transmission coefficient, |S21(f)| displays an abrupt change of the resonant dip position once the power of the pump field overcomes a critical value Pcr. This sharp shift occurs in a narrow region of pump frequencies, and can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. It is a signature of bistability of the photon number inside the resonator, in agreement with theory.</p>

The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native implementations of targeted algorithms in the quantum-classical pipeline, the toolkit builds upon and integrates with widely used open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks through a plugin system, allowing users to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic.

            <p>Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linear optical gain. However, spontaneous emission is not a fundamental property of the emitter. By engineering metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters into microcavities coupled to patch antennas, we have demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting a collimated beam with excellent spatial properties and a factor 100 increase in the collected power, compared to standard devices. Our results illustrate that by reshaping the photonic environment around emitting dipoles, as in the Purcell effect, it is possible to enhance the spontaneous emission and conceive efficient optoelectronic light emitting devices that operate close to the thermodynamical equilibrium as LEDs in the visible range.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental observation of stimulated cooling in the non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting exciton-polaritons from approximately room temperature down to 20K. By resolving the condensate in energy-momentum space and performing interferometric measurements, we distinguish the condensate from thermalized particles yet occupying excited states macroscopically. In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 065301 (2022)], we observe segmentation of the particle density along the excited states into two fractions both following Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with different effective temperatures and chemical potentials. Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Quantum Entanglement in Autonomous Thermal Machines: Effects of Non-Markovianity, Hilbert Space Structure, and Quantum Coherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Achraf Khoudiri, Khadija El Anouz, Abderrahim El Allati</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of entanglement generation in an external quantum system via interaction with a quantum autonomous thermal machine (QATM) under non-Markovian dynamics. The QATM, composed of two qubits each coupled to independent thermal reservoirs, interacts with an external system of two additional qubits. By analyzing the Hilbert space structure, energy level configurations, and temperature gradients, we define a common interaction between the QATM qubits and the external system qubits, which allows the definition of two thermodynamic cycles (A and B) governed by virtual temperatures and energy-conserving transitions. We demonstrate that the QATM can act as a structured reservoir capable of inducing non-Markovian memory effects, as highlighted by negative entropy production rates. Using mutual information and concurrence, we show that entanglement is generated only under cycle A, which is associated with stronger non-Markovian behavior and higher coherence correlations. Our results demonstrate that temperature differences, Hilbert space structure, and coherence serve as quantum resources for controlling and enhancing entanglement in quantum thermodynamic settings, with parameters consistent with experimental superconducting qubit platforms.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental realization of strong longitudinal (ZZ) coupling between two superconducting transmon qubits achieved solely through capacitive engineering. By systematically varying the qubit frequency detuning, we measure cross-Kerr inter-qubit interaction strengths ranging from 10 MHz up to 350 MHz, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously observed in similar capacitively coupled systems. In this configuration, the qubits enter a strong-interaction regime in which the excitation of one qubit inhibits that of its neighbor, demonstrating a dynamical blockade mediated entirely by the engineered ZZ coupling. Circuit quantization simulations accurately reproduce the experimental results, while perturbative models confirm the theoretical origin of the energy shift as a hybridization between the computational states and higher-excitation manifolds. We establish a robust and scalable method to access interaction-dominated physics in superconducting circuits, providing a pathway towards solid-state implementations of globally controlled quantum architectures and cooperative many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>Eliminating cryogenic operating requirements while preserving microsecond-scale quantum coherence and enabling CMOS scalability remains a central challenge for telecom quantum technologies. Addressing this, we introduce a CMOS-compatible quantum system comprising single-erbium-(Er)-ion qudits (five-level systems) operating across the visible and telecom C-band. Through innovative nanofabrication, we achieve self-aligned ion placement, enabling spatial isolation of single-Er ions and suppressing dephasing. We realize individually addressable single-Er-devices with record-long optical coherence times in the telecom C-band exceeding 500 {\mu}s at ambient conditions, a performance previously limited to vacuum conditions at temperatures over 900 times lower. Furthermore, we present the first demonstration of background-free, upconversion-enabled single-photon Er-emissions providing coherent, high-contrast optical readouts.

            <p>Precision, robustness, and efficiency are crucial aspects in the design of quantum technologies. Here, we show how genuine quantum features, together with non-Gaussianity, can be the key elements to achieve the best of these three aspects during a quantum battery-charging process. Taking inspiration from a light-matter interaction paradigm, i.e., the Jaynes-Cummings model, we employ the Full Counting Statistics to study the stochastic exchanges of energy between an entire stack of qubits and a single-mode electromagnetic field (or mechanical oscillator). Our study allows to conclude that charging the battery through a sequential protocol involving a quantum non-Gaussian field state guarantees extremely high-performances in the charging process, whose precision is maximized even under sub-optimal operating conditions. These results highlight the potential of non-Gaussian quantum state charging to achieve a robust quantum precision advantage over Gaussian states of the field by suppressing detrimental quantum fluctuations, thus making it suitable to ultimate tasks for which a significant degree of accuracy is required.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a robust scheme for quantum information storage based on bound states in a two-dimensional coupled-cavity array. When a target cavity is tuned to resonance with the array, a bound state in the continuum (BIC) emerges, coexisting with two conventional bound states outside the band. The resulting dynamics reflects a delicate interplay between these bound states, which can be fully captured through exact analytical solutions. In the weak-coupling regime, the BIC dominates, enabling perfect and persistent information storage. At stronger coupling, all bound states contribute, leading to oscillatory behavior and reduced storage fidelity. These results, valid at both zero and finite reservoir temperatures and further supported by a single-particle framework, reveal distinctive non-Markovian features in continuous-variable systems and highlight the potential of photonic lattices for scalable all-optical decoherence-free quantum memory platforms.</p>

            <p>Improving multiparameter quantum estimation in magnonic systems via quantum noise suppression is a well-established and critical research objective. In this work, we propose an experimentally realistic scheme to improve the precision of simultaneously estimating different parameters in a cavity-magnon system by utilizing a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The OPA enhances the estimation precision by decreasing the most informative quantum Cramér-Rao bound, calculated employing the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). We show that when nonlinearity is introduced into the system, quantum noise is significantly suppressed. Our results show how different physical parameters influence multiparameter estimation precision and provide a detailed discussion of the associated physical mechanisms in the steady state. Our results focus on exploring practical Gaussian measurement schemes that can be realized experimentally. Besides, we further analyze the system's dynamics, comparing both the SLD quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the classical Fisher information (CFI) for both homodyne and heterodyne detection. This approach provides a robust foundation for multiparameter quantum estimation, offering significant potential for application in hybrid magnomechanical and optomechanical systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum-correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, constitute a fundamental resource for quantum technologies, enabling enhanced performance in quantum metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum communications. The practical deployment of such technologies requires squeezed-light sources that are compact, efficient, low-cost, and robust. Here we report a compact narrowband source of two-mode squeezed light at 795 nm based on four-wave mixing in hot 85Rb atomic vapor. The source is implemented in a small, modular architecture featuring a single fiber-coupled input, an electro-optic phase modulator combined with a single Fabry-Perot etalon for probe generation, and two free-space output modes corresponding to the signal and conjugate fields. Optimized for low pump power, the system achieves up to -8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing at an analysis frequency of 0.8 MHz with a pump power of only 300 mW. The intrinsic narrowband character of the generated quantum states makes this source particularly well suited for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking, including interfaces with atomic quantum memories. Our results establish a versatile and portable platform for low-SWaP squeezed-light generation, paving the way toward deployable quantum-enhanced technologies.</p>

            <p>Two applications of gates from the B gate equivalence class can generate all two-qubit gates. This local equivalence class is invariant under the mirror (multiplication with the SWAP gate) operation, inverse (Hermitian conjugate) operation, and the combined inverse and mirror operations. The last two symmetries are associated with the ability of a two-qubit gate to generate the two-qubit local gates and the SWAP gate in two applications. No single local equivalence class of two-qubit gates, except the B gate equivalence class, has these two symmetries. Only the planar regions of the Weyl chamber, describing the mirror operation, contain the local equivalence classes with either one of the two symmetries. We show that there exist one-parameter families of local equivalence classes on these planes, with and without the B gate equivalence class, such that each of them can be used to construct a parameterized universal two-qubit quantum circuit that involves only two nonlocal two-qubit gates. We also discuss the implementation of the gates from a few families of local equivalence classes on superconducting quantum computers for optimal generation of all two-qubit gates.</p>

            <p>Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We identify localizable entanglement (LE) as an order parameter for measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT). LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to being essentially constant for the volume-law phase thereby, discover an intrinsic length scale $\xi_E$ that diverges at the critical measurement probability $p_c$. While classical percolation transition captures successful transport across a network, MIPT as characterized by LE can be interpreted as quantifying the amount of quantum teleportation between two given nodes in a quantum circuit. Building on this insight, we propose a two-ancilla protocol that provides an experimentally accessible readout of entanglement redistribution across the transition.</p>

            <p>Recently, it has been shown that group Fourier analysis of quantum states, i.e., decomposing them into the irreducible representations (irreps) of a symmetry group, enables new ways to characterize their resourcefulness. Given that quantum phase spaces (QPSs) provide an alternative description of quantum systems, and thus of the group's representation, one may wonder how such harmonic analysis changes. In this work we show that for general compact Lie-group quantum resource theories (QRTs), the entire family of Stratonovich-Weyl quantum phase space representations-characterized by the Cahill-Glauber parameter $s$-has a clear resource-theoretic and signal-processing meaning. Specifically, changing $s$ implements a group Fourier filter that can be continuously tuned to favor low-dimensional irreps where free states have most of their support ($s=-1$), leave the spectrum unchanged ($s=0$), or highlight resourceful, high-dimensional irreps ($s=1$). As such, distinct QPSs constitute veritable group Fourier filters for resources. Moreover, we show that the norms of the QRT's free state Fourier components completely characterize all QPSs. Finally, we uncover an $s$-duality relating the phase space spectra of free states and typical (Haar-random) highly resourceful states through a shift in $s$. Overall, our results provide a new interpretation of QPSs and promote them to a signal-processing framework for diagnosing, filtering, and visualizing quantum resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyu Meng, Yangshuai Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have attracted growing interest for scientific machine learning, yet in regression settings they often suffer from limited trainability under noisy gradients and ill-conditioned optimization. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical regression framework designed to mitigate these bottlenecks. Our model prepends a lightweight classical embedding that acts as a learnable geometric preconditioner, reshaping the input representation to better condition a downstream variational quantum circuit. Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes. We further observe reduced structured errors that are visually correlated with oscillatory components on several scientific benchmarks, suggesting that geometric preconditioning combined with curriculum training is a practical approach for stabilizing quantum regression.</p>

            <p>For any kind of wave phenomenon one can find ways to derive the respective dispersion relation from experimental observations and measurements. This dispersion relation determines the structure of the wave equation and thus characterizes the dynamics of the respective wave. Different wave phenomena are thus governed by different differential equations. Here we want to emphasize the experimental approach to matter waves, but before doing so we will discuss and test the procedure for other types of waves, in particular water waves.</p>

            <h2>AlphaSyndrome: Tackling the Syndrome Measurement Circuit Scheduling Problem for QEC Codes</h2>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet repeated syndrome-measurement cycles dominate its spacetime and hardware cost. Although stabilizers commute and admit many valid execution orders, different schedules induce distinct error-propagation paths under realistic noise, leading to large variations in logical error rate. Outside of surface codes, effective syndrome-measurement scheduling remains largely unexplored. We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code.</p>

            <h2>Quantum State Preparation of Ferromagnetic Magnons by Parametric Driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Monika E. Mycroft, Rostyslav O. Serha, Andrii V. Chumak, Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero</p>
            <p>We propose a method to prepare and certify Gaussian quantum states of the ferromagnetic resonance spin-wave modes in ferromagnets using a longitudinal drive. Contrary to quantum optics-based strategies, our approach harnesses a purely magnonic feature - the spin-wave nonlinearity - to generate magnon squeezing. This resource is used to prepare vacuum-squeezed states, as well as entangled states between modes of different magnets coupled via a microwave cavity. We propose methods to detect such states with classical methods, such as ferromagnetic resonance or local pickup coils, and quantify the required detection efficiency. We analytically solve the case of ellipsoidal yttrium iron garnet ferrimagnets, but our method applies to a vast range of shapes and sizes. Our work enables quantum magnonics experiments without single-magnon sources or detectors (qubits), thus bringing the quantum regime within reach of the wider magnonics community.</p>

            <p>The concept of random walk, in which particles or waves undergo multiple collisions with the microscopic constituents of a surrounding medium, is central to understanding diffusive transport across many research areas. However, this paradigm may break down in complex systems, where quantum interference and memory effects render the particle propagation anomalous, often fostering localization. Here we report on the observation of such anomalous dynamics in a minimal setting: an ultracold mass-imbalanced mixture of two fermionic gases in three dimensions. We release light impurities into a gas of heavier atoms and follow their evolution across different collisional regimes. Under strong interspecies interactions, by lowering the temperature we unveil a crossover from normal diffusion to subdiffusion. Simultaneously, a localized fraction of the light gas emerges, displaying no discernible dynamics over hundreds of collisions. Our findings, incompatible with the conventional Fermi-liquid picture, are instead captured by a model of an atom propagating through a (quasi-)static disordered landscape of point-like scatterers. These results highlight the key role of quantum interference in our mixture, which emerges as a versatile platform for exploring disorder-free localization phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Qi Fang, Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate loopless multiterminal hybrid superconducting devices at odd fermion parity with time-reversal symmetry. We find that the energy-phase relationship has a double minimum corresponding to opposite windings of the superconducting phases. Spin-orbit coupling adds multi-axial spin splittings, which contrasts with two-terminal devices where spin dependence is uniaxial. Capacitive shunting localizes quantum circuit states in the wells and exponentially suppresses their splitting. For weak spin-orbit strength, the system has a four-dimensional spin-chirality low-energy subspace which can be universally controlled with electric fields only.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Qualifiers for Neural Network Model Selection in Hadronic Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon B. Le, D. Keller</p>
            <p>As quantum machine-learning architectures mature, a central challenge is no longer their construction, but identifying the regimes in which they offer practical advantages over classical approaches. In this work, we introduce a framework for addressing this question in data-driven hadronic physics problems by developing diagnostic tools - centered on a quantitative quantum qualifier - that guide model selection between classical and quantum deep neural networks based on intrinsic properties of the data. Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the quantum qualifier identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models. Together, these results establish a principled framework for deploying quantum machine-learning tools in precision hadronic physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Jie Qiu, Xi-Wen Guan, Yi-Cong Yu</p>
            <p>Recently, researchers have proposed the Asymmetric Bethe ansatz method - a theoretical tool that extends the scope of Bethe ansatz-solvable models by "breaking" partial mirror symmetry via the introduction of a fully reflecting boundary. Within this framework, the integrability conditions which were originally put forward by Gaudin have been further generalized. In this work, building on Gaudin's generalized kaleidoscope model, we present a detailed investigation of the relationship between DN symmetry and its integrability. We demonstrate that the mathematical essence of integrability in this class of models is characterized by a newly proposed Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation. Furthermore, we show that the solvability of a model via the coordinate Bethe ansatz depends not only on the consistency relations satisfied by scattering matrices, but also on the model's boundary conditions and the symmetry of the subspace where solutions are sought. Through finite element method based numerical studies, we further confirm that Bethe ansatz integrability arises in a specific symmetry sector. Finally, by analyzing the algebraic structure of the Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation, we derive a series of novel quantum algebraic identities within the framework of quantum torus algebra.</p>

            <h2>Topological Anderson insulator and reentrant topological transitions in a mosaic trimer lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiatao Wang, Li Wang, Shu Chen</p>
            <p>We study the topological properties of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic-potential-modulated mosaic trimer lattice. To begin with, we first investigate the topological properties of the model in the clean limit free of quasiperiodic disorder based on analytical derivation and numerical calculations of the Zak phase $Z$ and the polarization $P$. Two nontrivial topological phases corresponding to the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling, respectively, are revealed. Then we incorporate the mosaic modulation and investigate the influence of quasiperiodic disorder on the two existing topological phases. Interestingly, it turns out that quasiperiodic disorder gives rise to multiple distinct effects for different fillings. At $2/3$ filling, the topological phase is significantly enhanced by the quasiperiodic disorder and topological Anderson insulator emerges. Based on the calculations of polarization and energy gap, we explicitly present corresponding topological phase diagram in the $\lambda-J$ plane. While for the $1/3$ filling case, % the topological phase is dramatically suppressed by the same quasiperiodic disorder. the quasiperiodic disorder dramatically compresses the topological phase, and strikingly, further induces the emergence of reentrant topological phase transitions instead. Furthermore, we verify the topological phase diagrams by computing the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility for both the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling cases. Our work exemplifies the diverse roles of quasiperiodic disorder in the modulation of topological properties, and will further inspire more research on the competitive and cooperative interplay between topological properties and quasiperiodic disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Kaicher, Joseph Vovrosh, Alexandre Dauphin, Simon B. Jäger</p>
            <p>We introduce equations of motion for a parity-violating fermionic mean-field theory (PV-FMFT): a numerically efficient fermionic mean-field theory based on parity-violating fermionic Gaussian states (PV-FGS). This work provides explicit equations of motion for studying the real- and imaginary-time evolution of spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with arbitrary geometries and interactions. We extend previous formulations of parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT) by including fermionic displacement operators in the variational Ansatz. Unlike PP-FMFT, PV-FMFT can be applied to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, describe quenches from arbitrary initial spin-1/2 product states, and compute local and non-local observables in a straight-forward manner at the same modest computational cost as PP-FMFT -- scaling as $O(N^3)$ in the worst case for a system of $N$ spins or fermionic modes. We demonstrate that PV-FMFT can exactly capture the imaginary- and real-time dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. We then study the post quench-dynamics of the one- and two-dimensional Ising model in presence of longitudinal and transversal fields with PV-FMFT and compute the single site magnetization and correlation functions, and compare them against results from other state-of-the-art numerical approaches. In two-dimensional spin systems, we show that the employed spin-to-fermion mapping can break rotational symmetry within the PV-FMFT description, and we discuss the resulting consequences for the calculated correlation functions. Our work introduces PV-FMFT as a benchmark for other numerical techniques and quantum simulators, and it outlines both its capabilities and its limitations.</p>

            <p>This work theoretically demonstrates that a spin qubit in a parabolic quantum wire driven by a bichromatic field exhibits a confinement-tunable synthetic gauge field, leading to novel Floquet topological phenomena. The study presents the underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, marked by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. Notably, the emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Additionally, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, including fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunneling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials has a versatile platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</p>

Away from the critical point, we discuss the interplay between the Laplacian and the Adjacency matrix in the whole parameter plane of the quantum Hamiltonian. These results allow us to paint the full picture of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model on graphs in the large $n$ limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Leifer, Cristhiano Duarte</p>
            <p>According to Aumann's celebrated theorem, rational agents cannot agree to disagree. In other words, agents who once shared a common prior probability distribution and who have common knowledge about their posteriors cannot assign different probability distributions to a given proposition. Common knowledge imposes strong restrictions on assigned probabilities. In fact, Aumann's agreement theorem was one of the first attempts to formalise and explore the role played by common knowledge in decision theory. Recently, the debate over possible (quantum) extensions of Aumann's results has resurfaced. This paper contributes to this discussion. First, we argue that agreeing to disagree is impossible in quantum theory. Secondly, by building on the quantum argument, we show that agreeing to disagree is also forbidden in any generalised probability theory. The upshot is that in its probabilistic version, the agreement theorem is a direct consequence of how we choose to condition upon acquiring new information.</p>

            <p>Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascués et al., New J. Phys. 10, 073013 (2008)], known as the Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the scalar extension [A. Pozas-Kerstjens et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new bilocal factorisation NPA hierarchy, prove its equivalence to a modified bilocal scalar extension NPA hierarchy, and characterise its convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario. We further explore its relations with the other known generalisations.</p>

            <p>Recently, feedback-based quantum algorithms have been introduced to calculate the ground states of Hamiltonians, inspired by quantum Lyapunov control theory. This paper aims to generalize these algorithms to the problem of calculating an eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian, assuming that the lower energy eigenstates are known.

We present two approaches for evaluating the circuit parameters: one based on the expectation and overlap estimation of the terms in the feedback law and another based on the gradient of the Lyapunov function. We demonstrate the algorithm through an illustrative example and through an application in quantum chemistry. To assess its performance, we conduct numerical simulations and execution on IBM's superconducting quantum computer.</p>

            <p>Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) might be a promise application in the NISQ era. However, the limited trainability of VQAs could hinder their scalability to large problem sizes. In this paper, we improve the trainability of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) by utilizing convex interpolation to solve portfolio optimization. Based on convex interpolation, the location of the ground state can be evaluated by learning the property of a small subset of basis states in the Hilbert space. This enlightens naturally the proposals of the strategies of close-to-solution initialization, regular cost function landscape, and recursive ansatz equilibrium partition. The successfully implementation of a $40$-qubit experiment using only $10$ superconducting qubits demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposals. Furthermore, the quantum inspiration has also spurred the development of a prototype greedy algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that the hybridization of VQE and greedy algorithms achieves a mutual complementarity, combining the advantages of both global and local optimization methods. Our proposals can be extended to improve the trainability for solving other large-scale combinatorial optimization problems that are widely used in real applications, paving the way to unleash quantum advantages of NISQ computers in the near future.</p>

            <p>Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</p>

            <p>We establish improved complexity estimates of quantum algorithms for linear dissipative ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and show that the time dependence can be fast-forwarded to be sub-linear. Specifically, we show that a quantum algorithm based on truncated Dyson series can prepare history states of dissipative ODEs up to time $T$ with cost $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log(T) (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, which is an exponential speedup over the best previous result. For final state preparation at time $T$, we show that its complexity is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T} (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, achieving a polynomial speedup in $T$. We also analyze the complexity of simpler lower-order quantum algorithms, such as the forward Euler method and the trapezoidal rule, and find that even lower-order methods can still achieve $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ cost with respect to time $T$ for preparing final states of dissipative ODEs. As applications, we show that quantum algorithms can simulate dissipative non-Hermitian quantum dynamics and heat processes with fast-forwarded complexity sub-linear in time.</p>

            <p>The description of a closed quantum system is extended with the identification of an underlying substructure enabling an expanded formulation of dynamics in the Heisenberg picture. Between measurements a ``state point" moves in an underlying multi-dimensional complex projective space with constant velocity determined by the quantum state vector. Following a measurement the point changes direction and moves with new constant velocity along one of several possible new orthogonal paths with probabilities determined by the Born Interpretation of the state vector. From this previously hidden substructure a new picture of quantum dynamics and quantum measurements emerges without violating existing no-gotheorems regarding hidden variables. A natural generalisation to a Riemannian substructure is proposed, determined by the entropy of the background environment. This leads to a suggestedinteraction between the substructure of quantum dynamics and the background gravitational field.</p>

Our algorithm performs tangential projections onto the set of separable states, leading to classically correlated quantum trajectories. By comparing this restricted evolution with the unrestricted one, we can characterize the entangling capabilities of quantum channels without making use of input-output relations. Moreover, applying this method is equivalent to solving the nonlinear master equation in Lindblad form introduced in \cite{PAH24} for two-qubit systems. We here extend these equations to multipartite systems of qudits, describing non-entangling dynamics in terms of a stochastic differential equation. We identify the impact of dynamical entanglement in open systems by applying our approach to several correlated decay processes. Therefore, our methodology provides a complete and ready-to-use framework to characterize dynamical quantum correlations caused by arbitrary open-system processes.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, autonomous stabilization of bosonic qubits has emerged as a promising approach for hardware-efficient protection of quantum information. However, applying these techniques to more complex encodings than the Schrödinger cat code requires exquisite control of high-order wave mixing processes. The challenge is to enable specific multiphotonic dissipation channels while avoiding unintended non-linear interactions. In this work, we leverage a genuine six-wave mixing process enabled by a near Kerr-free Josephson element to enforce dissipation of quartets of excitations in a high-impedance superconducting resonator. Owing to residual non-linearities stemming from stray inductances in our circuit, this dissipation channel is only effective when the resonator holds a specific number of photons. Applying it to the fourth excited state of the resonator, we show an order of magnitude enhancement of the state decay rate while only marginally impacting the relaxation and coherence of lower energy states. Given that stray inductances could be strongly reduced through simple modifications in circuit design and that our methods can be adapted to activate even higher-order dissipation channels, these results pave the way toward the dynamical stabilization of four-component Schrödinger cat qubits and even more complex bosonic qubits.</p>

This approach yields a compact expression for the system's propagator, which we show to be equivalent to existing formulations, such as the stochastic von Neumann equation (SVNE). A key advantage of our method is its generality: It can be extended to describe any open-system evolution defined on a suitable ordering contour. As a result, we adapt it to derive generalized versions of the SVNE that account for initial system-environment correlations, as well as stochastic equations that incorporate information about the statistics of energy flows in the environment. The insights offered by our technique further allow us to examine the nature of the noise processes appearing in the SVNE. We prove that its solution can be expressed in terms of a single physical noise, without any loss of information. Finally, we propose a semiclassical scenario in which this noise can be interpreted as arising from an initial measurement process on the environment.</p>

Assuming that the representation of $G$ is irreducible, we first show that a particular optimal measurement can be understood as the limit of weighted `pretty good measurements' (PGM). This naturally provides examples of state discrimination for which the unweighted PGM is provably sub-optimal. We extend this analysis to certain reducible representations, and use Schur-Weyl duality to discuss two particular examples of GU ensembles in terms of Werner-type and permutation-invariant generator states. For the case of pure-state GU ensembles we give a streamlined proof of optimality of the PGM first proved in [Eldar et al., 2004]. We use this result to give simplified proofs of the optimality of the PGM, along with expressions for the corresponding success probabilities, for two tasks: the hidden subgroup problem over semidirect product groups (first proved in [Bacon et al., 2005]), and port-based teleportation (first proved in [Mozrzymas et al., 2019] and [Leditzky, 2022]). Finally, we consider the $n$-copy setting and adapt a result of [Montanaro, 2007] to derive a compact and easily evaluated lower bound on the success probability of the PGM for this task. This result can be applied to the hidden subgroup problem to obtain a new proof for an upper bound on the sample complexity by [Hayashi et al., 2006].</p>

            <h2>Exact non-Markovian master equations: a generalized derivation for Gaussian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio D'Abbruzzo, Vittorio Giovannetti, Vasco Cavina</p>
            <p>We derive an exact master equation that captures the dynamics of a quadratic quantum system linearly coupled to a Gaussian environment of the same statistics: the Gaussian Master Equation (GME). Unlike previous approaches, our formulation applies universally to both bosonic and fermionic setups, and remains valid even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, allowing for the exact computation of the system's reduced density matrix across all parameter regimes. Remarkably, the GME shares the same operatorial structure as the Redfield equation and depends on a single kernel - a dressed environment correlation function accounting for all virtual interactions between the system and the environment. This simple structure grants a clear physical interpretation and makes the GME easy to simulate numerically, as we show by applying it to an open system based on two fermions coupled via superconductive pairing.</p>

            <h2>Scalable quantum simulator with an extended gate set in giant atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangze Chen, Anton Frisk Kockum</p>
            <p>Quantum computation and quantum simulation require a versatile gate set to optimize circuit compilation for practical applications. However, existing platforms are often limited to specific gate types or rely on parametric couplers to extend their gate set, which compromises scalability. Here, we propose a scalable quantum simulator with an extended gate set based on giant-atom three-level systems, which can be implemented with superconducting circuits. Unlike conventional small atoms, giant atoms couple to the environment at multiple points, introducing interference effects that allow exceptional tunability of their interactions. By leveraging this tunability, our setup supports both CZ and iSWAP gates through simple frequency adjustments, eliminating the need for parametric couplers. This dual-gate capability enhances circuit efficiency, reducing the overhead for quantum simulation. As a demonstration, we showcase the simulation of spin dynamics in dissipative Heisenberg XXZ spin chains, highlighting the setup's ability to tackle complex open quantum many-body dynamics. Finally, we discuss how a two-dimensional extension of our system could enable fault-tolerant quantum computation, paving the way for a universal quantum processor.</p>

            <p>We determine the covert capacity for entanglement generation over a noisy quantum channel. While secrecy guarantees that the transmitted information remains inaccessible to an adversary, covert communication ensures that the transmission itself remains undetectable. The entanglement dimension follows a square root law (SRL) in the covert setting, i.e., $O(\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs can be distributed covertly and reliably over $n$ channel uses. We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation.</p>

            <h2>Dynamically stable two-mode squeezing in cavity optomechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Wang, Shi-fan Qi</p>
            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme in a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, where a mechanical resonator couples to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through diagonalization of the full system's transition matrix in the Heisenberg picture. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the framework of open quantum system. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unsteady system states. Remarkably, the squeezing level can exceed the maximum achievable under system stability conditions. Furthermore, we show that our protocol is robust against systematic errors in both driving intensity and frequency, as well as against thermal Markovian noises. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Entanglement Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijie Cheng, Narayanan Rengaswamy</p>
            <p>Quantum network applications impose a variety of requirements on entanglement resources in terms of rate, fidelity, latency, and more. The repeaters in the quantum network must combine good methods for entanglement generation, effective entanglement distillation, and smart routing protocols to satisfy these application requirements. In this work, we focus on entanglement distillation in a linear chain of quantum repeaters. While conventional approaches reuse the same distillation scheme over multiple hop lengths after entanglement swaps, we propose a novel adaptive quantum error correction (QEC) scheme that boosts end-to-end metrics. Specifically, depending on the network operating point, we adapt the code used in distillation over successive rounds to monotonically increase the rate while also improving fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using three codes, with parameters [[9,1,3]], [[9,2,3]], [[9,3,3]], and a new performance metric, efficiency, that incorporates both overall rate and fidelity. Since the minimum input fidelity for QEC-based distillation is high, we then extend our study to include non-QEC-based purification protocols, specifically DEJMPS since it outperforms others. We compare the performance of end-to-end DEJMPS against adapting from DEJMPS to QEC once DEJMPS improves the initial fidelity to the threshold for QEC. Through a refined efficiency metric, we illuminate the regime where QEC is beneficial. These results provide a detailed outlook for entanglement purification and distillation in first and second generation quantum repeaters.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Topology Principles behind Topological Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zou, Hoi-Kwong Lo</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for realizing scalable quantum technologies, and topological quantum error correction (TQEC) has emerged as the most experimentally advanced paradigm of QEC. Existing homological and topological code constructions, however, are largely confined to orientable two-manifolds with simple boundary conditions. In this work, we develop a unified algebraic-topological framework for TQEC based on homology, cohomology, and intersection theory, which characterizes exactly when an arbitrary-dimensional manifold (with or without boundary) can serve as a quantum memory, thereby extending the standard 2D homological-code picture to arbitrary dimension and to manifolds with boundary via Poincaré-Lefschetz duality. Building on this classification, we introduce concrete code families that exploit nontrivial topology beyond the planar and toric settings. These include ``3-torus code'' and higher-dimensional ``volume codes'' on compact manifolds with mixed $X$- and $Z$-type boundaries. We further give a topological construction of qudit TQEC codes on general two-dimensional cell complexes using group presentation complexes, which unifies and extends several known quantum LDPC and homological-product-like constructions within a single geometric language. Finally, we combine the theoretical framework with numerical simulations to demonstrate that changing only the global topology can yield improved logical performance at fixed entanglement resources. Taken together, our results provide a systematic set of topological design principles for constructing and analyzing TQEC codes across dimensions and boundaries, and they open new avenues for topology-aware fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshar Ramkumar, Yiyi Cai, Yu Tong, Jiaqing Jiang</p>
            <p>Efficient simulation of a quantum system generally relies on structural properties of the quantum state. Motivated by the recent results by Bakshi et al. on the sudden death of entanglement in high-temperature Gibbs states of quantum spin systems, we study the high-temperature Gibbs states of bounded-degree local fermionic Hamiltonians, which include the special case of geometrically local fermionic systems. We prove that at a sufficiently high temperature that is independent of the system size, the Gibbs state is a probabilistic mixture of fermionic Gaussian states. This forms the basis of an efficient classical algorithm to prepare the Gibbs state by sampling from a distribution of fermionic Gaussian states. As a contrasting example, we show that high-temperature Gibbs states of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model are not convex mixtures of Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime are a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated coherent interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of $21~\mathrm{\mu K}$ and read out with 77% single-shot fidelity. During the $6~\mathrm{ms}$ lifetime of the membrane the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective qubit detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the position noise spectrum of the membrane, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at $10~\mathrm{mK}$ and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</p>

            <p>Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) wave packets, known for their vortex structure and nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), are of great interest in various scientific fields. Here we study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a spatially-localized electron LG wave packet interacting with an inhomogeneous external electric field that violates the axial symmetry of the initial wave function. We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its qualitative form. We demonstrate that due to the interaction with the external field, the degenerate zeros of the initial wave function located on the $z$ axis split into multiple nondegenerate nodes in the transverse plane representing separate single-charge vortices. This mechanism resembles the analogous effects known in topological optics. These findings provide new insights into controlling and manipulating twisted matter beams and into their possible instabilities.</p>

            <p>We revisit quantum tomography in an informationally incomplete scenario and propose improved state reconstruction methods using deep neural networks. In the first approach, the trained network predicts an optimal linear or quadratic reconstructor with coefficients depending only on the collection of (already taken) measurement operators. This effectively refines the undercomplete tomographic reconstructor based on pseudoinverse operation. The second, based on an LSTM recurrent network performs state reconstruction sequentially. It can also optimize the measurement sequence, which suggests a no-free-lunch theorem for tomography: by narrowing the state space, we gain the possibility of more efficient tomography by learning the optimal sequence of measurements. Numerical experiments for a 2-qubit system show that both methods outperform standard maximum likelihood estimation and also scale to larger 3- and 4-qubit systems. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively learn the underlying geometry of multi-qubit states using this for their reconstruction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhruv Baheti, Shubhayan Sarkar</p>
            <p>Quantum networks with independent sources allow observing quantum nonlocality or steering with just a single measurement per node of the network, or without any inputs. Inspired by the recently introduced notion of swap-steering, we consider here the triangle network scenario without inputs, where one of the parties is trusted to perform a well-calibrated measurement. In this scenario, we first propose a linear witness to detect triangle network swap-steering. Then, by using the correlations that achieve the maximum value of this inequality, and assuming that all the sources are the same, we can self-test the state generated by the sources and the measurements of the untrusted party. We then extend this framework to ring networks with an arbitrary number of nodes with one of them being trusted. Interestingly, this is the first example of a topologically robust, that is, one can observe steerability without assuming the network structure of the network, as well as noise-robust quantum advantage in a network. Additionally, by allowing the trusted party to perform tomography of their subsystems, we demonstrate that every bipartite entangled state will result in swap-steerable correlations in the ring network. For this purpose, we construct linear witnesses to detect ring network swap-steering corresponding to every bipartite entangled state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Ostner, Innocenzo De Marco, Christian Roubal</p>
            <p>Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on semiconductor laser phase noise are an inexpensive and efficient resource for true random numbers. Commercially available technology allows for designing QRNG setups tailored to specific use cases. However, it is important to constantly monitor whether the QRNG is performing according to the desired security standards in terms of independence and uniform distribution of the generated numbers. This is especially important in cryptographic applications. This paper presents a test scheme that helps to assess the acceptable operating conditions of a semiconductor laser for QRNG operation, using commonly accessible methods. This can be used for system monitoring, but crucially also to help the user choose the laser diode which better suits their needs. Two specific quality measurements, ensuring proper operation of the device, are explained and discussed. Setup-specific approaches for setting an acceptance boundary for these measures are presented and exemplary measurement data showing their effectiveness is given. By following the comprehensible procedure described here, a QRNG qualification environment tailored to specific security requirements can be reproduced.</p>

            <p>Quantum devices comprised of elementary components with more than two stable levels - so-called qudits - enrich the accessible Hilbert space, enabling applications ranging from fault-tolerant quantum computing to simulating complex many-body models. While several quantum platforms are built from local elements that are equipped with a rich spectrum of stable energy levels, schemes for the efficient control and entanglement of qudits are scarce. Importantly, no experimental demonstration of multi-qudit control has been achieved to date in neutral atom arrays. Here, we propose a general scheme for controlling and entangling qudits and perform a full analysis for the case of qutrits, encoded in ground and metastable states of alkaline earth atoms. We find an efficient implementation of single-qudit gates via the simultaneous driving of multiple transition frequencies. For entangling operations, we provide a concrete and intuitive recipe for the controlled-Z (CZ) gate for any local dimension d, realized through alternating single qudit and entangling pulses that simultaneously drive up to two Rydberg transitions. We further prove that two simultaneous Rydberg tones are, in general, the minimum necessary for implementing the CZ gate with a global drive. The pulses we use are optimally-controlled, smooth, and robust to realistic experimental imperfections, as we demonstrate using extensive noise simulations. This amounts to a minimal, resource-efficient, and practical protocol for realizing a universal set of gates. Our scheme for the native control of qudits in a neutral atom array provides a high-fidelity route toward qudit-based quantum computation, ready for implementation on near-term devices.</p>

            <p>Coherent two-state oscillations are observed in numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-longitudinal-field Ising model (TLFIM) within false vacuum decay regimes. Starting from the false vacuum (a nearly fully polarized ferromagnetic state), we show that in moderate-sized systems, at resonances $h\approx 2J/n$ (with longitudinal field $h$, transverse field $J$, and an integer $n$), the expected decay can give way to coherent oscillations between the false vacuum and a symmetric resonant state. The oscillation frequency, i.e., the tunneling splitting, is observed notably to exhibit a superradiant-like $\sqrt{L}$ enhancement, as confirmed by a Schrieffer-Wolff analysis. In large chains, coherence remains for $n\gtrsim L/2$ due to bubble-size blockade and is robust against stronger transverse fields; for small $n$, long-range interactions can stabilize the oscillations by lifting multi-bubble degeneracies, establishing a robust many-body coherence mechanism beyond perturbative and finite-size limits.</p>

The measured dependencies of SiV- PL lifetime and intensity on excitation wavelength, together with the enhancement dependence on Ns concentration in the studied nanodiamonds, provide unambiguous evidence of the involvement of donor nitrogen in SiV-emission dynamics. Saturation curves and second-order PL intensity correlation measurements further indicate suppression of the population of the optically inactive SiV2- state upon the addition of green excitation.

            <p>Errors occurring on noisy hardware pose a key challenge to reliable quantum computing. Existing techniques such as error correction, mitigation, or suppression typically separate the error handling from the algorithm analysis and design.

For a given quantum algorithm and error model, we derive worst-case fidelity bounds which can be efficiently computed to certify the robustness. We consider general error models including coherent and (Markovian) incoherent errors and allowing for set-based error descriptions to address uncertainty or time-dependence in the errors. Our results give rise to guidelines for robust algorithm design and compilation by optimizing our theoretical robustness measure. We demonstrate the practicality of the framework with numerical results on algorithm analysis and robust optimization, including the robustness analysis of a 50-qubit modular adder circuit.</p>

            <p>We revisit exact WKB quantization for radial Schrödinger problems from the modern resurgence perspective, with emphasis on how ``physically meaningful'' quantization paths should be chosen and interpreted. Using connection formulae at simple turning points and at regular singular points, we show that the nontrivial-cycle data give the spectrum. In particular, for the $3$-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the $3$-dimensional Coulomb potential, we explicitly compute a closed contour which starts at $+\infty$, bulges into the $r<0$ sector to encircle the origin, and returns to $+\infty$. Also we propose that the appropriate slice of the closed path provides a physical local basis at $r=0$, which is used by an origin-to-$\infty$ open path. Via the change of variables $r=e^x$ ($x\in(-\infty,\infty)$), the origin data are pushed to the boundary condition of convergence at $x\to-\infty$, which renders the equivalence between open-connection and closed-cycle quantization transparent. The Maslov contribution from the regular singularity is incorporated either as a small-circle monodromy which is justified in terms of renormalization group, or, equivalently, as a boundary phase; we also develop an optimized/variational perturbation theory on exact WKB. Our analysis clarifies, in radial settings, how mathematical monodromy data and physical boundary conditions dovetail, thereby addressing recent debates on path choices in resurgence-based quantization.</p>

Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow.

            <p>We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries. Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.</p>

            <p>Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices impose dual challenges on quantum circuit execution: limited qubit connectivity requires extensive SWAP-gate routing, while time-dependent decoherence progressively degrades quantum information.

We present TRAM (Transverse Relaxation Time-Aware Qubit Mapping), a coherence-guided compilation framework that elevates decoherence mitigation to a primary optimization objective. TRAM integrates calibration-informed community detection to construct noise-resilient qubit partitions, generates time-weighted initial mappings that anticipate coherence decay, and dynamically schedules SWAP operations to minimize cumulative error accumulation. Evaluated on Qiskit-based simulators with realistic noise models, TRAM outperforms SABRE by 3.59% in fidelity, reduces gate count by 11.49%, and shortens circuit depth by 12.28%, establishing coherence-aware optimization as essential for practical quantum compilation in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Folded optimal transport and its application to separable quantum optimal transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Borsoni</p>
            <p>We introduce folded optimal transport, as a method to extend a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole convex, related to convex extension. This construction broadens the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case of the convex being a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the folded Kantorovich cost and folded Wasserstein distances, and study their induced metric properties. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Franca [4], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. We also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [16] cost writes as a folded Kantorovich cost. Folded optimal transport therefore provides a unified framework for classical, semiclassical and separable quantum optimal transport.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Generative Machine Learning for Accelerated Quantum-centric Supercomputing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chayan Patra, Dibyendu Mondal, Sonaldeep Halder, Dipanjali Halder, Mostafizur Rahaman Laskar, Richa Goel, Rahul Maitra</p>
            <p>Quantum centric supercomputing (QCSC) framework, such as sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) holds immense promise toward achieving practical quantum utility to solve challenging problems. QCSC leverages quantum computers to perform the classically intractable task of sampling the dominant fermionic configurations from the Hilbert space that have substantial support to a target state, followed by Hamiltonian diagonalization on a classical processor. However, noisy quantum hardware produces erroneous samples upon measurements, making robust and efficient configuration-recovery strategies essential for a scalable QCSC pipeline. Toward this, in this work, we introduce PIGen-SQD, an efficiently designed QCSC workflow that utilizes the capability of generative machine learning (ML) along with physics-informed configuration screening via implicit low-rank tensor decompositions for accurate fermionic state reconstruction. The physics-informed pruning is based on a class of efficient perturbative measures that, in conjunction with hardware samples, provide a substantial overlap with the target state. This distribution induces an anchoring effect on the generative ML models to stochastically explore only the dominant sector of the Hilbert space for effective identification of additional important configurations in a self-consistent manner. Our numerical experiments performed on IBM Heron R2 quantum processors demonstrate this synergistic workflow produces compact, high-fidelity subspaces that substantially reduce diagonalization cost while maintaining chemical accuracy under strong electronic correlations. By embedding classical many body intuitions directly into the generative ML model, PIGen-SQD advances the robustness and scalability of QCSC algorithms, offering a promising pathway toward chemically reliable quantum simulations on utility-scale quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Improved Lower Bounds for QAC0</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malvika Raj Joshi, Avishay Tal, Francisca Vasconcelos, John Wright</p>
            <p>In this work, we prove the strongest known lower bounds for QAC$^0$, allowing polynomially many gates and ancillae. Our main results show that: (1) Depth-3 QAC$^0$ circuits cannot compute PARITY, and require $\Omega(\exp(\sqrt{n}))$ gates to compute MAJORITY. (2) Depth-2 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions (e.g., PARITY) with non-negligible advantage, regardless of size. We develop new classical simulation techniques for QAC$^0$ to obtain our depth-3 bounds. In these results, we relax the output requirement of the quantum circuit to a single bit, making our depth $2$ approximation bound stronger than the previous best bound of Rosenthal (2021). This also enables us to draw natural comparisons with classical AC$^0$ circuits, which can compute PARITY exactly in depth $2$ (exp size). Our techniques further suggest that, for boolean total functions, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts. Our third result shows that depth $2$ QAC$^0$ circuits, regardless of size, cannot exactly synthesize an $n$-target nekomata state (a state whose synthesis is directly related to the computation of PARITY). This complements the depth $2$ exponential size upper bound of Rosenthal (2021) for approximating nekomatas (which is used as a sub-circuit in the only known constant depth PARITY upper bound). Finally, we argue that approximating PARITY in QAC0, with significantly better than 1/poly(n) advantage on average, is just as hard as computing it exactly. Thus, extending our techniques to higher depths would also rule out approximate circuits for PARITY and related problems</p>

            <h2>Shuttling Compiler for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers Based on Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Kreppel, Reza Salkhordeh, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler, André Brinkmann</p>
            <p>Trapped-ion quantum computers based on segmented traps rely on shuttling operations to establish long-range connectivity between sub-registers. Qubit routing dynamically reconfigures qubit positions so that all qubits involved in a gate operation are co-located within the same segment, a task whose complexity increases with system size. To address this challenge, we propose a layout-independent compilation strategy based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we fine-tune pretrained LLMs to generate the required shuttling operations. We evaluate this approach on linear and branched one-dimensional architectures using quantum circuits of up to $16$ qubits. Our results show that the fine-tuned LLMs generate valid shuttling schedules and, in some cases, outperform previous shuttling compilers by requiring approximately $15\,\%$ less shuttle overhead. However, results degrade as the algorithms increase in width and depth. In future, we plan to improve LLM-based shuttle compilation by enhancing our training pipeline using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO).</p>

            <h2>Real Matrix Representations of Quantum Operators: An Introduction to Quantum Index Algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.Yu. Volkov, G.A. Koroteev, Yu.S. Volkov</p>
            <p>We introduce Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) as a finite, index-based algebraic framework for representing and manipulating quantum operators on Hilbert spaces of dimension $2^m$. In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indrajit Sen, Matthew Leifer</p>
            <p>We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sam Kuypers</p>
            <p>Local realism has been the subject of much discussion in modern physics, partly because our deepest theories of physics appear to contradict one another in regard to whether reality is local. According to general relativity, it is, as physical quantities (perceptible or not) in two spacelike separated regions cannot affect one another. Yet, in quantum theory, it has traditionally been thought that local realism cannot hold and that such effects do occur. This apparent discrepancy between the two theories is resolved by Everettian quantum theory, as first proven by Deutsch & Hayden (2000). In this paper, I will explain how local realism is respected in quantum theory and review the advances in our understanding of locality since Deutsch & Hayden's work, including the concept of local branching and the more general analysis by Raymond-Robichaud (2021)</p>

            <h2>Breaking the Orthogonality Barrier in Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenta Kasai</p>
            <p>Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded. In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the active part of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design circumvents conventional structural distance limitations induced by parent-matrix orthogonality, and enables the construction of quantum LDPC codes with large girth while avoiding latent low-weight logical operators. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.</p>

            <h2>Classical simulation of a quantum circuit with noisy magic inputs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiwon Heo, Sojeong Park, Changhun Oh</p>
            <p>Magic states are essential for universal quantum computation and are widely viewed as a key source of quantum advantage, yet in realistic devices they are inevitably noisy. In this work, we characterize how noise on injected magic resources changes the classical simulability of quantum circuits and when it induces a transition from classically intractable behavior to efficient classical simulation. We adopt a resource-centric noise model in which only the injected magic components are noisy, while the baseline states, operations, and measurements belong to an efficiently simulable family. Within this setting, we develop an approximate classical sampling algorithm with controlled error and prove explicit noise-dependent conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Our framework applies to both qubit circuits with Clifford baselines and fermionic circuits with matchgate baselines, covering representative noise channels such as dephasing and particle loss. We complement the analysis with numerical estimates of the simulation cost, providing concrete thresholds and runtime scaling across practically relevant parameter regimes.</p>

            <p>We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.</p>

Fermions are charged with respect to the field $A_{\sf{vac}}$, so lifting the Dirac equations from space-time ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ to phase space $T^*{\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ results in their solutions being localized in the space ${\mathbb R}^{p-1}$ or in space-time ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$.

First, we identify a smooth path of gapped symmetric Hamiltonians whose ground states transform inequivalently under the symmetry.

            <p>Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array, formed in a Si$_{0.972}$Ge$_{0.028}$ quantum well, manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1$\mu$m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation.

            <p>Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. These quasiparticles are speculated to be the origin of chirality-induced spin selectivity and presumably can display exotic dynamic behaviors. However, direct experimental evidence of spin-phonon polarons has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests itself as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence or quantum sensing performance.</p>

Moreover, starting from a quantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of interactions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime, where thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann weight involving an effective temperature.

During the training phase, the slack variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance.

            <p>We investigate the formation of moire quasicrystal patterns in Bose gasses confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the total density wave amplitude exhibit the stage for the emergence of moire quasicrystal patterns, where the pattern formation is closely associated with the momenta of collective modes excited by the weak periodic drive. Through analyzing the radial and angular density wave amplitude, we find that these new collective modes are only coupled radially and cannot be decoupled eventually. The symmetry of quasicrystal patterns can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moire quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</p>

            <p>We use the transfer tensor method to analyze localization and transport in simple disordered systems, specifically the Anderson and Aubry-André-Harper models. Emphasis is placed on the memory effects that emerge when ensemble-averaging over disorder, even when individual trajectories are strictly Markovian. We find that transfer tensor memory effects arise to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called "outgoing-pseudoflux".

The joint concavity/convexity of the trace functions $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}$ is also discussed based on theory of quantum divergences.</p>

            <h2>Cosmological Entanglement Entropy from the von Neumann Algebra of Double-Scaled SYK & Its Connection with Krylov Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>We investigate entanglement entropy between the pair of type II$_1$ algebras of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model given a chord state, its holographic interpretation as generalized horizon entropy; particularly in the (anti-)de Sitter ((A)dS) space limits of the bulk dual; and its connection with Krylov complexity. The density matrices in this formalism are operators in the algebras, which are specified by the choice of global state; and there exists a trace to evaluate their von Neumann entropy since the algebras are commutants of each other, which leads to a notion of algebraic entanglement entropy. We match it in triple-scaling limits to an area computed through a Ryu-Takayanagi formula in (A)dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at the asymptotic timelike or spacelike boundaries respectively; providing a first-principles example of holographic entanglement entropy for (A)dS$_2$ space. This result reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking and Gibbons-Hawking entropy formulas for specific entangling regions points, while it decreases for others. This construction does not display some of the puzzling features in dS holography. The entanglement entropy remains real-valued since the theory is unitary, and it depends on the Krylov spread complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state. At last, we discuss higher dimensional extensions.</p>

            <p>Strongly interacting many-body systems exhibit collective properties that emerge from complex correlations among microscopic degrees of freedom. These cooperative phenomena govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, with relevance ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum field theories describing fundamental aspects of our universe. Understanding such emergent dynamics from first principles remains one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation dynamics following quenches in 2D ferromagnetic quantum Ising systems implemented in an atomic Rydberg array. Our experiments reveal two distinct regimes: In the confined regime, we observe an energy-dependent cluster size, revealing large collective clusters exceeding ten spins. In contrast, the deconfined regime is characterized by kinetically constrained, avalanche-like nucleation dynamics involving the entire system. Our findings establish a new frontier for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays, enabling controlled exploration of non-equilibrium phenomena previously out of reach. Beyond advancing experimental capabilities, they provide fundamental insights into highly correlated processes with implications that reach from quantum magnetism and glassy dynamics to cosmological models of the early universe.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Arzano, Alessandra D'Alise, Simone del Rosso, Domenico Frattulillo</p>
            <p>A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Hashimoto, Masaya Kunimi, Tetsuro Nikuni</p>
            <p>We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</p>

This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision.

            <h2>Elevator Codes: Concatenation for resource-efficient quantum memory under biased noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Shanahan, Diego Ruiz</p>
            <p>Biased-noise qubits, in which one type of error (e.g. $X$- and $Y$-type errors) is significantly suppressed relative to the other (e.g. $Z$-type errors), can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum error correction. Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $\eta \ge 7\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $\eta = 2 \times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the existence of an extended non-equilibrium critical phase, characterized by sub-exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), in the surface code subject to heralded random Pauli measurement channels. By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have attracted considerable interest due to their role in weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems. We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>We reconsider the quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics of the charging process of a simple, two-component quantum battery model made up of a charger qubit and a single--cell battery qubit. We allow for the initial quantum state of the charger to lie anywhere on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and find the generalized analytical expressions describing the stored energy, ergotropy and capacity of the battery, all of which depend upon the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner evocative of the quantum area theorem. The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations. Our theoretical groundwork may be useful for guiding forthcoming experiments in quantum energy science based upon coupled two-level systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures the sequential interactions between a thermal absorber and a long-lived coherent probe. The comb provides a causal, multi-time description of coherence transport, tracking how the probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations. Using a process-tensor formulation, we derive closed form expressions showing that interference between the two interaction windows generates a non-monotonic memory response that reflects a fundamental competition between the absorbers thermal population and its dynamical correlations. By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach is readily compatible with circuit-QED platforms and offers a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments.</p>

            <h2>The two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities of a superconducting qubit interacting with thermal photons in a cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroo Azuma</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study the two-time Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities of a quantum optical model that appears in the Josephson-junction quantum bit (qubit) interacting with an external magnetic flux. This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger.</p>

            <p>We study the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA), which treat imaginarity as a resource in distributed scenarios. For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy. Our findings shed light on the role that off-resonant interactions have in the efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Maurer, Thomas F. Allard, Yanko Todorov, Guillaume Weick, David Hagenmüller</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.</p>

            <p>Three-qubit gates are highly beneficial operations in quantum computing, enabling compact implementations of quantum algorithms and efficient generation of multipartite entangled states. However, realizing such gates with high fidelity remains challenging due to crosstalk, complex control requirements, and the overhead of parametric or tunable couplers. In this work, we propose and analyze the implementation of fast, high-fidelity three-qubit gates using giant atoms -- artificial atoms coupled to a waveguide at multiple spatially separated points. By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term quantum computers and quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Near-term quantum networks face a bottleneck due to low quantum communication rates. This degrades performance both by lowering operating speeds and increasing qubit storage time in noisy memories, making some quantum internet applications infeasible. One way to circumvent this bottleneck is multiplexing: combining multiple signals into a single signal to improve the overall rate. Standard multiplexing techniques are classical in that they do not make use of coherence between quantum channels nor account for decoherence rates that vary during a protocol's execution. In this paper, we first derive semiclassical limits to multiplexing for many-qubit protocols, and then introduce two techniques: single click quantum multiplexing and multi-server multiplexing. These can enable beyond-classical multiplexing advantages. We illustrate these techniques through three example applications: 1) entanglement generation between two asymetric quantum network nodes (i.e., repeaters or quantum servers with inequal memories), 2) remote state preparation between many end user devices and a single quantum node, and 3) remote state preparation between one end user device and many internetworked quantum nodes. By utilizing many noisy internetworked quantum devices instead of fewer low-noise devices, our multiplexing strategies enable new paths towards achieving high-speed many-qubit quantum network applications.</p>

The workflow is applied to predict the relative energies of two conformers of the 300-atom Trp-cage miniprotein. The methodology employs wave function-based embedding (EWF) as the underlying fragmentation framework, in which all atoms in the system are explicitly included in the CI treatment. CI calculations for individual fragments are performed using either sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) for challenging fragments or full configuration interaction (FCI) for trivial fragments. To assess the accuracy of SQD for fragment CI calculations, EWF-(FCI,SQD) results are compared against EWF-MP2 and EWF-CCSD benchmarks. Overall, the results demonstrate that large-scale electronic configuration interaction (CI) simulations of protein systems containing hundreds or even thousands of atoms can be realized through the combined use of quantum and classical computing resources.</p>

            <p>Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further suggests a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. A. Downing, M. S. Ukhtary</p>
            <p>We reconsider the quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics of the charging process of a simple, two-component quantum battery model made up of a charger qubit and a single--cell battery qubit. We allow for the initial quantum state of the charger to lie anywhere on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and find the generalized analytical expressions describing the stored energy, ergotropy and capacity of the battery, all of which depend upon the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner evocative of the quantum area theorem. The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations. Our theoretical groundwork may be useful for guiding forthcoming experiments in quantum energy science based upon coupled two-level systems.</p>

            <h2>Two-tooth bosonic quantum comb for temporal-correlation sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaojiang Zhu, Xinyuan You, Alexander Romanenko, Anna Grassellino</p>
            <p>We introduce a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures the sequential interactions between a thermal absorber and a long-lived coherent probe. The comb provides a causal, multi-time description of coherence transport, tracking how the probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations. Using a process-tensor formulation, we derive closed form expressions showing that interference between the two interaction windows generates a non-monotonic memory response that reflects a fundamental competition between the absorbers thermal population and its dynamical correlations. By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach is readily compatible with circuit-QED platforms and offers a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments.</p>

            <h2>The two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities of a superconducting qubit interacting with thermal photons in a cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroo Azuma</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study the two-time Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities of a quantum optical model that appears in the Josephson-junction quantum bit (qubit) interacting with an external magnetic flux. This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger.</p>

            <h2>Off-resonant preservation and generation of imaginarity in distributed scenarios</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Min Wang, Ming-Liang Hu, Heng Fan</p>
            <p>We study the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA), which treat imaginarity as a resource in distributed scenarios. For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy. Our findings shed light on the role that off-resonant interactions have in the efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic quantum description of surface plasmon polaritons: revealing intrinsic ultrastrong light-matter coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Maurer, Thomas F. Allard, Yanko Todorov, Guillaume Weick, David Hagenmüller</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.</p>

            <h2>Efficient three-qubit gates with giant atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangze Chen, Anton Frisk Kockum</p>
            <p>Three-qubit gates are highly beneficial operations in quantum computing, enabling compact implementations of quantum algorithms and efficient generation of multipartite entangled states. However, realizing such gates with high fidelity remains challenging due to crosstalk, complex control requirements, and the overhead of parametric or tunable couplers. In this work, we propose and analyze the implementation of fast, high-fidelity three-qubit gates using giant atoms -- artificial atoms coupled to a waveguide at multiple spatially separated points. By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term quantum computers and quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Qiang Gao, Chunxiao Liu, Joel E. Moore</p>
            <p>Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further suggests a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashish Kumar Patra, Saikumar Krithivasan</p>
            <p>Wave packet revivals and fractional revivals are hallmark quantum interference phenomena that arise in systems with nonlinear energy spectra, and their signatures in expectation values of observables have been studied extensively in earlier work. In this article, we build on these studies and extend the analysis in two important directions. First, we investigate fractional revival dynamics in angular momentum observables, deriving explicit expressions for the time evolution of their moments and demonstrating that higher-order angular momentum moments provide clear and selective signatures of fractional revivals. Second, we examine classical analogs of quantum revival phenomena and elucidate structural similarities between quantum fractional revivals and recurrence behavior in representative classical systems. Using the Kerr-type nonlinear Hamiltonian as a paradigmatic model, we analyze the autocorrelation function, moment dynamics, and phase-space structures, supported by visualizations such as quantum carpets. Our results broaden the range of experimentally accessible diagnostics of fractional revivals and provide a unified perspective on revival phenomena across quantum and classical dynamical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Lang</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the optical dipole interaction between a multi-level quantum system and a single-mode optical waveguide of any local polarisation. We investigate several paradoxical seeming situations, for example we find a situation in which there exist two non-orthogonal quantum states, each of which results in a photon flux in the opposite direction to the other. We show how, despite appearances, this does not break the unitary requirements of quantum mechanics. We also find that an isotropic quantum emitter can be either reflective or transmissive to light depending on the waveguide polarisation at the emitter location, indeed in the zero loss limit such a system changes from 100% transmission to 100% reflection due to an infinitesimal polarisation rotation. An example case for a four level system is also considered, which is found to operate as a non-destructive parity measurement of the photon number.</p>

            <h2>Time-Dynamic Circuits for Fault-Tolerant Shift Automorphisms in Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Younghun Kim, Spiro Gicev, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman</p>
            <p>Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising approach for realizing low-overhead logical quantum memories. Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes. Furthermore, our work can lead to alternative syndrome extraction circuit designs, such as leakage removal protocols, providing a practical pathway to utilizing dynamic circuits that extend beyond surface codes towards qLDPC codes.</p>

            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing ground state energies of molecular systems. We implement VQE to calculate the potential energy surface of the hydrogen molecule (H$_2$) across 100 bond lengths using the PennyLane quantum computing framework on an HPC cluster featuring 4$\times$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80GB each). We present a comprehensive parallelization study with four phases: (1) Optimizer + JIT compilation achieving 4.13$\times$ speedup, (2) GPU device acceleration achieving 3.60$\times$ speedup at 4 qubits scaling to 80.5$\times$ at 26 qubits, (3) MPI parallelization achieving 28.5$\times$ speedup, and (4) Multi-GPU scaling achieving 3.98$\times$ speedup with 99.4% parallel efficiency across 4 H100 GPUs. The combined effect yields 117$\times$ total speedup for the H$_2$ potential energy surface (593.95s $\rightarrow$ 5.04s). We conduct a CPU vs GPU scaling study from 4--26 qubits, finding GPU advantage at all scales with speedups ranging from 10.5$\times$ to 80.5$\times$. Multi-GPU benchmarks demonstrate near-perfect scaling with 99.4% efficiency and establish that a single H100 can simulate up to 29 qubits before hitting memory limits. The optimized implementation reduces runtime from nearly 10 minutes to 5 seconds, enabling interactive quantum chemistry exploration.</p>

            <h2>Pseudomode approach to Fano effect in dissipative cavity quantum electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Kobayashi, Tatsuro Yuge</p>
            <p>We study the Fano effect in dissipative cavity quantum electrodynamics, which originates from the interference between the emitter's direct radiation and that mediated by a cavity mode. Starting from a two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir, we show that a quantum master equation previously derived within the Born-Markov approximation can be rederived by introducing a single auxiliary mode via pseudomode approach. We identify the corresponding spectral function of the system--environment interaction and demonstrate that it consists of a constant and a non-Lorentzian contribution forming the Fano profile. The constant term is shown to be essential for obtaining a Lindblad master equation and is directly related to the rate associated with this Fano interference. Furthermore, by applying Fano diagonalization to a common-environment setup including an explicit cavity mode, we independently derive the same spectral function in the strongest-interference regime. Our results establish a unified framework for describing the Fano effect in single-mode cavity QED systems and clarify its non-Markovian origin encoded in the spectral function.</p>

            <h2>Casimir interactions as a probe of broadband optical response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Calum F. Shelden, Jeremy N. Munday</p>
            <p>Casimir forces arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations and depend on the dielectric response of interacting materials across the entire frequency spectrum. Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response. Using supervised machine learning to invert Lifshitz theory, we determine the complex permittivity of a material over more than seven orders of magnitude in frequency from a single force-distance curve. We show that measurements at different separations selectively constrain distinct frequency ranges of the dielectric response, providing direct physical insight into how quantum fluctuations sample the electromagnetic spectrum. These results establish Casimir interactions as a physically constrained, broadband spectroscopic tool and open new opportunities for optical characterization in regimes inaccessible to conventional techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Fang, Jixuan Ruan, Sharanya Prabhu, Ang Li, Travis Humble, Dean Tullsen, Yufei Ding</p>
            <p>The transition to the fault-tolerant era exposes the limitations of homogeneous quantum systems, where no single qubit modality simultaneously offers optimal operation speed, connectivity, and scalability. In this work, we propose a strategic approach to Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures (HQA) that synthesizes the distinct advantages of the superconducting (SC) and neutral atom (NA) platforms. We explore two architectural role assignment strategies based on hardware characteristics: (1) We offload the latency-critical Magic State Factory (MSF) to fast SC devices while performing computation on scalable NA arrays, a design we term MagicAcc, which effectively mitigates the resource-preparation bottleneck. (2) We explore a Memory-Compute Separation (MCSep) paradigm that utilizes NA arrays for high-density qLDPC memory storage and SC devices for fast surface-code processing. Our evaluation, based on a comprehensive end-to-end cost model, demonstrates that principled heterogeneity yields significant performance gains. Specifically, our designs achieve $752\times$ speedup over NA-only baselines on average and reduce the physical qubit footprint by over $10\times$ compared to SC-only systems. These results chart a clear pathway for leveraging cross-modality interconnects to optimize the space-time efficiency of future fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have extensively explored chaotic dynamics in quantum optical systems through the mean-field approximation, which corresponds to an ideal, fluctuation-free scenario. However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations. These results provide a bidirectional validation of the quantum mechanical suppression of chaos.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maristella Crotti, Luca Razzoli, Luigi Giannelli, Giuseppe A. Falci, Giuliano Benenti</p>
            <p>We investigate the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime under environmental dissipation. The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions.</p>

In this work, we record the output of a membrane-in-the-middle microcavity system operating at room temperature and achieving high cooperativity, $C>n_\text{th}$, and apply a nonlinear transform that removes all orders of TIN, improving the mechanical signal-to-noise ratio by nearly 10 dB.

            <p>Dicke states serve as a critical resource in quantum metrology, communication, and computation. However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the logarithmic-depth barrier by moving beyond the standard circuit model and leveraging global interactions (native to architectures such as neutral atoms and trapped ions). Specifically, utilizing unbounded CZ gates (i.e. within the QAC$^0$ circuit class), we offer circuits for exact computation of constant-weight Dicke states, using polynomial ancillae, and approximation of weight-1 Dicke states (i.e. $W$ states), using only constant ancillae. Granted additional access to the quantum FAN-OUT operation (i.e. upgrading to the QAC$_f^0$ circuit class), we also achieve exact preparation of arbitrary-weight Dicke states, with polynomial ancillae. These protocols distinguish the constant-depth capabilities of quantum architectures based on connectivity and offer a novel path toward resolving a long-standing quantum complexity conjecture.</p>

            <p>While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.</p>

            <p>Accurately capturing electron correlation in large-scale molecular systems remains one of the foremost challenges in quantum chemistry and a primary driver for the development of quantum algorithms. Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.</p>

With respect to observables, it has recently been conjectured that, when truncated to a sufficiently narrow energy window, their statistical properties can be described by an unitarily invariant ensemble, and testable criteria have been introduced, which are based on the scaling behavior of free cumulants. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture numerically in translationally invariant Heisenberg spin chains with spin quantum number $S =\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2}$. Combining a quantum-typicality-based numerical method with the exploitation of the system's symmetries, we study the spin current operator and find clear evidence of consistency with the proposed criteria in chaotic cases. Our findings further support the conjecture of the existence of RMT universality as manifest in the observable properties in quantum chaotic systems.</p>

            <p>We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sean M. Bresler, Erin M. Adkins, Stephen P. Eckel, Tobias K. Herman, David A. Long, Benjamin J. Reschovsky, Daniel S. Barker</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a Doppler thermometer based on direct optical frequency comb spectroscopy of an $^{85}$Rb vapor with a chirped electro-optic frequency comb (EOFC). The direct EOFC Doppler thermometer is accurate to within its approximately 1 K statistical uncertainty. We experimentally compare direct EOFC spectroscopy with conventional Doppler spectroscopy using a single-frequency, step-scanned laser probe. Our results show that direct EOFC spectroscopy mitigates transit-induced optical pumping distortion of the atomic lineshape, which is the dominant systematic temperature shift in alkali atom Doppler thermometry. Optical Bloch equation simulations of conventional and direct EOFC Doppler spectroscopy confirm that EOFC spectroscopy can use higher optical power to reduce statistical noise without optical pumping distortion. Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring.</p>

            <h2>Useful entanglement can be extracted from noisy graph states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konrad Szymański, Lina Vandré, Otfried Gühne</p>
            <p>Cluster states and graph states in general offer a useful model of the stabilizer formalism and a path toward the development of measurement-based quantum computation. Their defining structure - the stabilizer group - encodes all possible correlations that can be observed during measurement. The measurement outcomes which are consistent with the stabilizer structure make error correction possible. Here, we leverage both properties to design feasible families of states that can be used as robust building blocks of quantum computation. This procedure reduces the effect of experimentally relevant noise models on the extraction of smaller entangled states from the larger noisy graph state. In particular, we study the extraction of Bell pairs from linearly extended graph states - this has the immediate consequence for state teleportation across the graph. We show that robust entanglement can be extracted by proper design of the linear graph with only a minimal overhead of the physical qubits. This scenario is relevant to systems in which the entanglement can be created between neighboring sites. The results shown in this work provide a mathematical framework for noise reduction in measurement-based quantum computation. With proper connectivity structures, the effect of noise can be minimized for a large class of realistic noise processes.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum model consisting of an ensemble of overdamped spin$-1/2$ particles with ferromagnetic couplings, driven by a radially homogeneous magnetic field. The spontaneous magnetization of the spin components breaks the $SO(3)$ (or $SO(2)$) symmetry, inducing an ordered phase of flocking. Our model converges to the Vicsek model in the classical limit and corresponds to the Toner-Tu model in the continuous limit. Our investigation not only elucidates the intrinsic connection between these two models, but also introduces new opportunities for exploring the mechanisms underlying flocking order and correlations at the quantum level, which maybe pave the way for a new field of research -- the quantum active matter.</p>

            <h2>Undecidability of the spectral gap in rotationally symmetric Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Castilla-Castellano, Angelo Lucia</p>
            <p>The problem of determining the existence of a spectral gap in a lattice quantum spin system was previously shown to be undecidable for one [J. Bausch et al., "Undecidability of the spectral gap in one dimension", Physical Review X 10 (2020)] or more dimensions [T. S. Cubitt et al., "Undecidability of the spectral gap", Nature 528 (2015)]. In these works, families of nearest-neighbor interactions are constructed whose spectral gap depends on the outcome of a Turing machine Halting problem, therefore making it impossible for an algorithm to predict its existence. While these models are translationally invariant, they are not invariant under the other symmetries of the lattice, a property which is commonly found in physically relevant cases. This poses the question of whether the spectral gap problem could be decidable for Hamiltonians with stronger symmetry constraints. We give a negative answer to this question, in the case of models with 4-body (plaquette) interactions on the square lattice satisfying rotation, but not reflection, symmetry: rotational symmetry is not enough to make the problem decidable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koji Yamaguchi, Achim Kempf</p>
            <p>We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. Encrypted cloning represents a new paradigm that provides a form of redundancy, parallelism or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem. For example, a possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage.</p>

            <p>Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and a promising platform for future quantum information technology as silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times in solid-state. At the same time, silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics activity, and photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity and find the optimal donor species for different coupling mechanisms.</p>

            <p>In classical systems, the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem establishes that resonant tori of integrable Hamiltonians are destroyed by any nonintegrable perturbation, whereas nonresonant tori are only deformed up to a finite value of the perturbation parameter. In this contribution, we identify a quantum analog of this differentiated sensitivity for one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians subject to periodic instantaneous kicks. After detecting quantum signatures of resonances in the participation ratio and in the quasiprobability phase-space distribution of Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we show that eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian exhibit greater sensitivity against the perturbation when they satisfy a resonant condition. The sensitivity is quantified through the fidelity between perturbed and unperturbed eigenstates. This differentiated sensitivity becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows. Our findings are supported by numerical results and insights from analytical calculations based on unitary perturbation theory. Although our analysis focuses on kicked models, the mechanism could be extended to more general periodic drivings, providing a preliminary step toward a quantum counterpart of the classical breaking of resonant tori.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mpemba Effect Induced by Non-Markovian Exceptional Point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Zhou Zhang, Hong-Gang Luo, Wei Wu</p>
            <p>Quantum Mpemba effect describes an anomalous phenomenon of accelerated relaxation which is of fundamental interest in the field of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Conventional theories on this phenomenon strongly rely on the Born-Markovian approximation resulting in a Lindblad-type master equation whose evolution is governed by a Liouvillian superoperator. It has been demonstrated that exceptional points of the Liouvillian superoperator can induce the Mpemba effect in Markovian regimes. Moving beyond this Markovian limit, we here propose a mechanism for realizing the quantum Mpemba effect in a general non-Markovian relaxation process by means of non-Markovian exceptional points. We verify the feasibility of this mechanism within a dissipative quantum harmonic oscillator model, which is exactly solvable and experimentally practical. Providing new insight into the interesting non-equilibrium dynamics, our work paves a way to accelerate the transfer of energy and information in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting bosonic systems have been widely explored, yet most realizations rely on fine-tuned interactions or enlarged symmetries. Here we show that a qualitatively simpler mechanism--parity order coupled to bond dimerization--acts as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify two distinct topological phases absent in the purely dimerized model: an SPT phase at half filling stabilized by positive parity coupling, and a topological phase at unit filling stabilized by negative coupling that can be adiabatically connected to a trivial phase without breaking any symmetry. Our results establish parity order as a new organizing principle for correlation-driven bosonic topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhordan Santiago, Petr Steindl</p>
            <p>Multi-photon-added cat states are constructed by repeatedly applying the creation operator to a cat state. We study in detail their photon-number distribution, $Q$ parameter, squeezing properties, and Wigner function. We show that photon addition induces a $\pi$ phase shift in the original parity configuration whenever an odd number of photons is added, reflected as swapped vanishing probabilities and phase space displacements at the origin. Remarkably, the same process drives these states into a sub-Poissonian regime regardless of the relative phase between their coherent state components, making them valuable resources for quantum imaging, at the cost of losing quadrature squeezing, but gaining amplitude-squared one. We also discuss how these states can be generated using existing hardware.</p>

            <p>Tweezer arrays of polar molecules present new opportunities for quantum science and quantum information. However, a major challenge, especially in bialkali molecule platforms, is the fact that current measurement schemes for the internal states are destructive. In this work, we present a method to use Rydberg atoms to nondestructively measure the internal state of a molecular qubit. We achieve this via microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms, allowing us to tune the interactions so that there are minimal Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and many measurements can take place simultaneously. We consider two experimentally-motivated examples of detecting $^{23}$Na$^{133}$Cs and $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs with $^{133}$Cs atoms. Finally, we discuss several strategies for mitigating various sources of crosstalk.</p>

            <p>We report on the observation of a new magic frequency within the hyperfine structure of the D2 line of ${}^{87}$Rb atoms at which the scattering of light into a high-finesse cavity is suppressed by an interplay between quantum interference and the strong collective coupling of atoms to the cavity. Scattering from a cloud of laser-driven cold atoms into the cavity was measured in a polarization sensitive way. We have found that both the Rayleigh and Raman scattering processes into the near-resonant cavity modes are extinguished at 185 MHz below the F=2$\leftrightarrow$F'=3 transition frequency. This coincidence together with the shape of the observed spectral dip imply that the effect relies on a quantum interference in the polariton excitations of the strongly coupled combined atom-photon system. We have also demonstrated the existence of a magic frequency around -506 MHz, where only the Raman scattering is suppressed due to a quantum interference effect at the single-atom level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Haines, Arshath Manjalingal, Logan Blackham, Saeed Rahamanian Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal</p>
            <p>Exciton-polaritons are light-matter hybrid quasi-particles that have emerged as a flexible platform for developing quantum technologies and engineering material properties. However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants.</p>

            <p>The open quantum Rabi model is studied in this work, with the explicit $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term incorporated as required by the Thomas-Reich-Kuhn sum rule. It is shown that anisotropy provides a generic and robust mechanism for overcoming the no-go theorem in dissipative quantum systems, thereby establishing a genuine platform for observing dissipative phase transitions. The inclusion of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term yields a significantly richer and asymmetric steady-state phase diagram, consisting of normal, superradiant, and bistable phases that intersect at tricritical points, while isolated bistable phases also emerge and the number of tricritical points is reduced. Notably, it is near the intersection of the two critical-line branches enclosing the superradiant phases, rather than at the tricritical points, that the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term fundamentally alters the scaling of photon-number fluctuations. Given the inherent role of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term in light-matter interactions, our findings open a realistic route toward the experimental investigation and dynamical control of nonequilibrium critical phenomena in practical open quantum platforms.</p>

The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</p>

            <p>The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force between normal metals, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.</p>

            <p>Multimodal learning aims to enhance perceptual and decision-making capabilities by integrating information from diverse sources. However, classical deep learning approaches face a critical trade-off between the high accuracy of black-box feature-level fusion and the interpretability of less outstanding decision-level fusion, alongside the challenges of parameter explosion and complexity. This paper discusses the accuracy-interpretablity-complexity dilemma under the quantum computation framework and propose a feature entanglement-based quantum multimodal fusion neural network. The model is composed of three core components: a classical feed-forward module for unimodal processing, an interpretable quantum fusion block, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for deep feature extraction. By leveraging the strong expressive power of quantum, we have reduced the complexity of multimodal fusion and post-processing to linear, and the fusion process also possesses the interpretability of decision-level fusion. The simulation results demonstrate that our model achieves classification accuracy comparable to classical networks with dozens of times of parameters, exhibiting notable stability and performance across multimodal image datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Bhadra, Diyansha Singh, Angana Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Building reliable quantum computers requires protecting fragile quantum states from inevitable environmental noise and operational errors. While quantum error correction codes like the Steane $[\![7,1,3]\!]$ code provide elegant theoretical solutions, their practical success hinges critically on how we measure errors - a process called syndrome extraction. The challenge lies in the ancilla qubits used for measurement: when they fail, errors can cascade across the entire quantum system, destroying the very information we're trying to protect. We address this fundamental problem by implementing and comparing three sophisticated syndrome measurement strategies: Shor's cat-state approach, which distributes measurements across multiple entangled ancillas achieving 85-92% preparation success; Steane's encoded-ancilla method using complete error-corrected logical qubits reaching 97.8% syndrome fidelity; and a flexible unified framework that adapts strategies based on hardware capabilities. Through extensive simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform spanning randomized benchmarking and T-heavy circuits, we demonstrate that intelligent ancilla management improves error suppression by up to 2.4$\times$ compared to standard approaches. Our implementations achieve logical error rates as low as $5.1 \times 10^{-5}$ under realistic noise conditions with physical error rates of $10^{-3}$, while maintaining near-unity logical fidelity (0.99997) even for deep circuits. The threshold analysis reveals robust performance across distance-3 to distance-13 codes with characteristic threshold curves showing exponential error suppression below the critical physical error rate. These results provide immediately deployable tools for near-term quantum devices and establish practical design principles for scaling toward fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Tackling Heterogeneity in Quantum Federated Learning: An Integrated Sporadic-Personalized Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ratun Rahman, Shaba Shaon, Dinh C. Nguyen</p>
            <p>Quantum federated learning (QFL) emerges as a powerful technique that combines quantum computing with federated learning to efficiently process complex data across distributed quantum devices while ensuring data privacy in quantum networks. Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <h2>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: Experimental Predictions</h2>

            <p>We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\alpha_S$ relative to $\alpha$ ($\alpha_S/\alpha \sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^6 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.</p>

            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires extremely precise knowledge and control of qubit dynamics during the application of a gate. We develop a data-driven learning protocol for characterizing quantum gates that builds off previous work on learning the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig (NMZ) formulation of open system dynamics from time series data, which allows detailed reconstruction of quantum evolution, including non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate this learning technique on three different systems: a simulation of a qubit whose dynamics are purely Markovian, a simulation of a driven qubit coupled to stochastic noise produced by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and trapped-ion experimental data of a driven qubit whose noise environment is not characterized ahead of time. Our technique is able to learn the generators of time evolution, or the NMZ operators, in all three cases and can learn the timescale in which the qubit dynamics can no longer be accurately described by a purely Markovian model. Our technique complements existing quantum gate characterization methods such as gate set tomography by explicitly capturing non-Markovianity in the gate generator, thus allowing for more thorough diagnosis of noise sources.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction is one of the fundamental building blocks of digital quantum computation. The Quantum Lego formalism has introduced a systematic way of constructing new stabilizer codes out of basic lego-like building blocks, which in previous work we have used to generate improved error correcting codes via an automated reinforcement learning process. Here, we take this a step further and show the use of a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. We combine classical reinforcement learning with calls to two commercial quantum devices to search for a stabilizer code to correct errors specific to the device, as well as an induced photon loss error.</p>

            <p>Understanding the energetic efficiency of quantum computers is essential for assessing their scalability and for determining whether quantum technologies can outperform classical computation beyond runtime alone. In this work, we analyze the energy required to solve the Boson Sampling problem, a paradigmatic task for quantum advantage, using a realistic photonic quantum computing architecture. Using the Metric-Noise-Resource methodology, we establish a quantitative connection between experimental control parameters, dominant noise processes, and energetic resources through a performance metric tailored to Boson Sampling. We estimate the energy cost per sample and identify operating regimes that optimize energetic efficiency. By comparing the energy consumption of quantum and state-of-the-art classical implementations, we demonstrate the existence of a quantum energetic advantage -- defined as a lower energy cost per sample compared to the best-known classical implementation -- that emerges before the onset of computational advantage, even in regimes where classical algorithms remain faster. Finally, we propose an experimentally feasible Boson Sampling architecture, including a complete noise and loss budget, that enables a near-term observation of quantum energetic advantage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuhiro Seki, Yuta Kikuchi, Tomoya Hayata, Seiji Yunoki</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a dissipative protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a first step, we derive a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel for the protocol recently proposed by Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.</p>

            <p>The exploration of photonic systems for quantum information processing has generated widespread interest in multiple cutting-edge research fields. Photonic frequency encoding stands out as an especially viable approach, given its natural alignment with established optical communication technologies, including fiber networks and wavelength-division multiplexing systems. Substantial reductions in hardware resources and improvements in quantum performance can be expected by utilizing multiple frequency modes. The integration of nonlinear photonics with microresonators provides a compelling way for generating frequency-correlated photon pairs across discrete spectral modes. Here, by leveraging the high material nonlinearity and low nonlinear loss, we demonstrate an efficient chip-scale multi-wavelength quantum light source based on AlGaAs-on-insulator, featuring a free spectral range of approximately 200 GHz at telecom wavelengths. The optimized submicron waveguide geometry provides both high effective nonlinearity (~550 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$) and broad generation bandwidth, producing eleven distinct wavelength pairs across a 35.2 nm bandwidth with an average spectral brightness of 2.64 GHz mW$^{-2}$nm$^{-1}$. The generation of energy-time entanglement for each pair of frequency modes is verified through Franson interferometry, yielding an average net visibility of 93.1%. With its exceptional optical gain and lasing capabilities, the AlGaAs-on-insulator platform developed here shows outstanding potential for realizing fully integrated, ready-to-deploy quantum photonic systems on chip.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benoît Boulanger, Gaspar Mougin-Trichon, Véronique Boutou</p>
            <p>The limit between the two regimes of spontaneous-parametric down-conversion (SPDC) or four-wave-mixing (FWM) regarding the pump intensity has been theoretically investigated using a semi-classical model and analytical calculations. A unitless quantity has been defined, corresponding to the photon-pairs flux per frequency unit: it has been found equal to 0.369 at this limit. The ratio between the magnitudes of the electric fields of the generated photons and of vacuum has been also calculated, equal to 1.718, and the pump intensity has been plotted as a function of the interaction length for different values of the second-order electric susceptibility in the case of SPDC and of the third-order electric susceptibility for FWM. These quantitative results confirm that below the limit, the nonlinear process can be truly considered as spontaneous, i.e. mainly seeded by the quantum fluctuations of vacuum, while the generated photons mainly govern the pump photon splitting above the limit, which corresponds more to an optical parametric amplification / difference frequency generation regime. Knowing quantitatively the limit between the two regimes thanks to the present calculations will be a useful guide for further quantum calculations and measurements from either side of the limit in order to catch the full quantum picture of SPDC and FWM from low to high pump intensities.</p>

We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis. The experimental results that we have obtained show good agreement with the theoretical values. Our method performs well under experimental losses and can be applied to highly non-degenerate sources, where there are no suitable detectors for one of the photons in the quantum state and our method could also be extended to the discrete degrees of freedom to certify high-dimensional (OAM) entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-Adapted State Preparation for Quantum Chemistry on Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktor Khinevich, Wataru Mizukami</p>
            <p>We present systematic and resource-efficient constructions of continuous symmetry projectors, particularly $U(1)$ particle number and $SU(2)$ total spin, tailored for fault-tolerant quantum computations. Our approach employs a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) as well as generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP and GQSVT) to implement projectors. These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis. For the total spin projection, the structured decomposition of $\hat{P}_{S,M_S}$ reduces the projector T gate count. Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems. Resource estimates further indicate that the cost of symmetry filtering is $3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude lower than that of the subsequent phase estimation step This advantage is especially relevant in large, strongly correlated systems, such as FeMoco, a standard strongly correlated open-shell benchmark. For FeMoco, the QPE cost is estimated at ${\sim}10^{10}$ T gates, while our symmetry projector requires only ${\sim}10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ T gates. These results establish continuous-symmetry projectors as practical and scalable tools for state preparation in quantum chemistry and provide a pathway toward realizing more efficient fault-tolerant quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>This whitepaper surveys the current landscape and short- to mid-term prospects for quantum-enabled optimization and machine learning use cases in industrial settings. Grounded in the QCHALLenge program, it synthesizes hardware trajectories from different quantum architectures and providers, and assesses their maturity and potential for real-world use cases under a standardized traffic-light evaluation framework. We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future). The resulting verdicts illuminate where quantum approaches currently offer promise, where hybrid classical-quantum strategies are most viable, and where classical methods are expected to remain superior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaotong Wang, Shunlong Luo, Yue Zhang</p>
            <p>Although the principle of superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and is the root of almost all quantum phenomena such as coherence and entanglement, its quantification, except for that related to the resource theory of coherence and interference, remains relatively less studied. In this work, we address quantification of superposition from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a family of quantifiers of superposition, the phase-sensitive superposition, by taking into account the phases of amplitudes in the superposition of a fixed basis states (e.g., computational basis states). We establish a conservation relation for the phase-sensitive superposition, which is a kind of complementary relation and is reminiscent of wave-particle duality. We evaluate explicitly the second moment of phase-sensitive superposition and show that it is intrinsically related to the $l^2$-norm coherence. We characterize the dephasing channel induced by the maximally superposed states. We investigate the minimum and maximum superpositions, reveal their basic properties, and illustrate them through various examples. We further explore the dynamics of superposition in the Grover search algorithm, and demonstrate a complementary relation between superposition and success probability of the search algorithm. These results and quantifiers offer tools for analyzing structural features and implications of quantum superposition.</p>

            <p>Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that physical properties of matter can be altered within an optical cavity by harnessing quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, even in the total absence of external driving fields. Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\sim13\,\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\sim2\,\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science.</p>

We show that such an order can be accessed through the measurement-induced steady state of a single primary qubit locally coupled to a spin lattice. Using a controlled primary-ancillary qubit protocol, we derive analytically that the steady state \emph{encodes} a locally weighted exchange field in a signed observable that is linear in the weak-coupling regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate lattice-scale resolution of antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic textures and robustness against short-correlated noise.

            <p>The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide a tutorial treatise on the fundamental research challenges of quantum transduction. The tutorial is structured around a communications engineering framework, thereby shedding light on its fundamental role in quantum network design and deployment -- a perspective often overlooked in existing literature. This framework allows us to categorize different transduction modalities and to reveal an unorthodox one where the transducer itself can act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</p>

            <p>Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta} \propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved in principle by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F.~Chen \emph{et al.}, Nature \textbf{646}, pp.~561--566 (2025)] -- the implementation of these ``exact Gibbs samplers'' requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging \emph{in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately simulating an exact Gibbs sampler that only requires the repeated implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous guarantees on the difference between the fixed point reached by our protocol and the exact thermal state, which only depend on parameters of the protocol and its \emph{mixing time}. The procedure is efficiently implementable on near-term devices if $H$ is local, and the mixing time scales mildly with both system size and protocol parameters. While guaranteeing the latter for Hamiltonians of interest remains an important problem for future work, here we lay the groundwork for developing fully efficient thermal state preparation protocols on quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum information processing with integrated photonics requires quantum logic operations with high fidelity and robustness. Directional couplers, the fundamental elements enabling quantum interference and logic operations, are inherently sensitive to fabrication imperfections and environmental fluctuations, leading to reduced gate fidelities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a passive design strategy that mitigates these errors by exploiting a stationary geometrical configuration in uniform directional couplers, where first-order variations in the coupling coefficient are intrinsically suppressed. The robust geometry is implemented in a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip hosting two-photon controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gates and its performance is directly compared to a non-optimized design. Measurements indicate a mean gate fidelity of $93.30 \pm 0.11\%$, representing a clear improvement over the non-robust implementation mean fidelity of $91.93 \pm 0.17\%$, without any active tuning or footprint increase. This performance approaches the theoretical limit of $93.78\%$, imposed by the imperfect source. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating realistic fabrication noise confirm the observed enhancement and reveal consistent suppression of gate-level error rates. These results demonstrate a compact, fabrication-tolerant building block for scalable, fault-tolerant photonic quantum circuits and highlight the power of passive geometric error mitigation in quantum hardware design.</p>

            <p>Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings identify an empirical coherence limit associated with intrinsic material properties and provide a data-driven basis for materials selection in future superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Building on the infinite-component Chern-Simons theory of three-dimensional fracton phases by Ma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, 195124 (2022)] and the Toeplitz braiding of anyons by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we show that stacking $(3+1)$D $BF$ topological field theories along a fourth spatial direction gives rise to an exotic class of four-dimensional fracton phases. Their low-energy physics is governed by a new field-theoretic framework -- infinite-component $BF$ (i$BF$) theories -- characterized by asymmetric integer Toeplitz $K$ matrices. Under open boundary conditions, i$BF$ theories exhibit a striking phenomenon: \textit{Toeplitz particle-loop braiding}, where a particle and a loop placed on opposite three-dimensional boundaries acquire a finite braiding phase even at infinite separation. This nonlocal braiding admits a geometric interpretation: transporting the particle induces a winding boundary trajectory on the opposite boundary that encircles the loop. We show that this robustness originates from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of Toeplitz $K$ matrices revealed by singular value decomposition (SVD), rather than from the eigenvalue zero modes responsible for previously known Toeplitz braiding of anyons. We analytically and numerically study representative i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type $K$ matrices, establishing a universal correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz particle-loop braiding. Our results identify boundary zero singular modes as the mechanism behind Toeplitz particle-loop braiding and establish infinite-component $BF$ theory as a predictive framework for higher-dimensional fracton topological orders.</p>

            <p>We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.</p>

            <p>We show that a two-proton emitter with a diproton-correlated initial state can act as a source of spin-correlated proton pairs. Using a time-dependent three-body model, we investigate the two-proton emission of $^{16}$Ne ($^{14}$O$+2p$) and analyze the spin correlation of the emitted protons. We find that, when the emission proceeds as a democratic three-body process from an initial state containing a spin-singlet diproton correlation, the emitted protons exhibit a pronounced spin-correlation pattern exceeding the local-hidden-variable bound. This spin correlation closely resembles that of a pure spin-singlet pair. In contrast, this pattern is lost when the process is dominated by the sequential emission or when the initial diproton correlation is absent. These results demonstrate that a certain class of two-proton emitters can deliver spin-entangled proton pairs, and their spin correlation reflects the diproton correlation embedded in the initial state.</p>

            <h2>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanshi Yang</p>
            <p>The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</p>

            <h2>Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Neng Zhou</p>
            <p>We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithm for dephasing of coupled systems: decoupling and IQP duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabrina Yue Wang, Raul A. Santos</p>
            <p>Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically.</p>

            <h2>The pros and cons of using deep reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms to design control schemes for quantum state transfer on qubit chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofía Perón Santana, Ariel Fiuri, Martín Domínguez, Omar Osenda</p>
            <p>In recent years, control methods based on different optimization techniques have shed light on the possibilities of processing information in many quantum systems. When exploring the transmission of quantum states, faster transmission times are mandatory to avoid the deleterious effects of multiple sources of decoherence that spoil the transmission process. In particular, using Reinforcement Learning to devise sequences of step-wise external controls provides good transfer policies at short transmission times. We present two approaches to control the transmission of quantum states in qubit chains using external controls to force the dynamical evolution of the chain state. The first approach relies on the well-known Genetic Algorithm to generate a sequence of external controls, while the second approach uses a variant of Reinforcement Learning. The Genetic algorithm achieves excellent transmission fidelity at as short transmission times as Reinforcement Learning, surpassing the fidelities achieved by the latter method. Nevertheless, the Reinforcement Learning method offers robust control policies when the control pulses are noisy enough, owing to an imperfect timing of the pulses, deficient control devices, or other sources of phase decoherence. We present the regime where each method is best suited to control the transmission of arbitrary qubit states.</p>

            <p>We introduce CL-QAS, a continual quantum architecture search framework that mitigates the challenges of costly amplitude encoding and catastrophic forgetting in variational quantum circuits. The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations. A bi-loop learning strategy separates circuit parameter optimization from architecture exploration, while an Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization ensures stability across sequential tasks. We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <h2>Informationally Complete Distributed Metrology Without a Shared Reference Frame</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua-Qing Xu, Gong-Chu Li, Xu-Song Hong, Lei Chen, Si-Qi Zhang, Yuancheng Liu, Geng Chen, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>In quantum information processing, implementing arbitrary preparations and measurements on qubits necessitates precise information to identify a specific reference frame (RF). In space quantum communication and sensing, where a shared RF is absent, the interplay between locality and symmetry imposes fundamental restrictions on physical systems. A restriction on realizable unitary operations results in a no-go theorem prohibiting the extraction of locally encoded information in RF-independent distributed metrology. Here, we propose a reversed-encoding method applied to two copies of local-unitary-invariant network states. This approach circumvents the no-go theorem while simultaneously mitigating decoherence-like noise caused by RF misalignment, thereby enabling the complete recovery of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Furthermore, we confirm local Bell-state measurements as an optimal strategy to saturate the QFI. Our findings pave the way for the field application of distributed quantum sensing, which is inherently subject to unknown RF misalignment and was previously precluded by the no-go theorem.</p>

            <h2>Even Odd Splitting of the Gaussian Quantum Fisher Information: From Symplectic Geometry to Metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaustav Chatterjee, Tanmoy Pandit, Varinder Singh, Pritam Chattopadhyay, Ulrik Lund Andersen</p>
            <p>We introduce a canonical decomposition of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for centered multimode Gaussian states into two additive pieces: an even part that captures changes in the symplectic spectrum and an odd part associated with correlation-generating dynamics. On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations. The framework supplies practical design rules for continuous-variable sensors and provides a geometric lens for benchmarking probes and channels in Gaussian quantum metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sinchan Snigdha Rej, Snigdhadev Ray, Bimalendu Deb</p>
            <p>Quantum computation (QC) and digital quantum simulation (DQS) essentially require two- or multi-qubit controlled-NOT or -phase gates. We propose an alternative pathway for QC and DQS using a three-qubit parity gate in a Rydberg atom array. The basic principle of the Rydberg atom parity gate (RPG) is that the operation on the target qubit is controlled by the parity of the control qubits. First, we discuss how to construct an RPG based on a dark state resonance. We optimize the gate parameters by numerically analyzing the time evolution of the computational basis states to maximize the gate fidelity. We also show that our proposed RPG is extremely robust against the Rydberg blockade error. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed RPG over the conventional CNOT or CZ gate in QC and DQS, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and simulate the Ising Hamiltonian. The results show that RPG can be a better substitute of the CNOT gate to yield better results, as it decreases the circuit noise by reducing circuit depth.</p>

            <p>Frequency-bin encoding offers tremendous potential in quantum photonic information processing, in which a single waveguide can support hundreds of lightpaths in a naturally phase-stable fashion. This stability, however, comes at a cost: arbitrary unitary operations can be realized by cascaded electro-optic phase modulators and pulse shapers, but require nontrivial numerical optimization for design and have thus far been limited to discrete tabletop components. In this article, we propose, formalize, and computationally evaluate a new paradigm for universal frequency-bin quantum information processing using acousto-optic scattering processes between distinct transverse modes. We show that controllable phase matching in intermodal processes enables 2$\times$2 frequency beamsplitters and transverse-mode-dependent phase shifters, which together comprise cascadable FRequency-transverse-mODe Operations (FRODOs) that can synthesize any unitary via analytical decomposition procedures. Modeling the performance of both random gates and discrete Fourier transforms, we demonstrate the feasibility of high-fidelity quantum operations with existing integrated photonics technology, highlighting prospects of parallelizable operations achieving 100\% bandwidth utilization. Our approach is realizable with CMOS technology, opening the door to scalable on-chip quantum information processing in the frequency domain.</p>

            <p>The motion of atoms in programmable optical tweezer arrays offers many new opportunities for neutral atom quantum science. These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\gtrsim3\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation</p>

            <p>Coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) has been widely investigated, and even been deployed in real-world quantum network. However, the proposal of the zero-error attack has critically undermined its security guarantees, and existing experimental implementations have not yet established security against coherent attacks. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an information-theoretically secure COW-QKD protocol that can resist source side-channel attacks, with secure transmission distances up to 100 km. Our system achieves a secure key rate on the order of kilobits per second over 50 km in the finite-size regime, sufficient for real-time secure voice communication across metropolitan networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the encrypted transmission of a logo with information-theoretic security over 100 km of optical fiber. These results confirm that COW-QKD can simultaneously provide simplicity and security, establishing it as a strong candidate for deployment in small-scale quantum networks.</p>

We show that the determinant of the coefficient matrix defines a natural, rank-sensitive geometric invariant that vanishes for all rank-2 states and is nonzero only for rank-3 entangled states. An explicit analytic constraint relating this determinant-based invariant to the I-concurrence is derived, thereby defining the physically accessible region of two-qutrit states in invariant space. Furthermore, we establish an operational correspondence with three-path optical interferometry and analyze conditional visibility and predictability in a qutrit quantum erasure protocol, including the effects of unequal path transmittances. Numerical demonstrations confirm the analytic results and the associated complementarity relations. These findings provide a unified geometric and operational framework for understanding two-qutrit entanglement.</p>

            <p>Accurately describing strongly correlated electronic systems remains a central challenge in quantum chemistry, as electron-electron interactions give rise to complex many-body wavefunctions that are difficult to capture with conventional approximations. Classical wavefunction-based approaches, such as the Semistochastic Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI) and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), currently define the state of the art, systematically converging toward the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit, but at a rapidly increasing computational cost. Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative "handover" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects. Achieving quantitative agreement on these canonical systems demonstrates a viable pathway toward quantum-enhanced simulations of complex bioinorganic molecules, catalytic mechanisms, and correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Achieving full control of a Bose-Einstein condensate can have valuable applications in metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum condensed matter physics. We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field. The results can be generalized for interacting condensates by changing the time-dependent detuning to compensate for the interaction. We find that a two-level algorithm for the inverse engineering remains numerically accurate even if the entire set of possible states is considered. The proposed approach is robust against the laser-field noise and systematic device-dependent errors.</p>

            <p>Entropy production quantifies the amount of irreversibility of a physical process, leading to fundamental bounds for thermodynamic quantities. Particularly in the quantum realm, considerable research has been carried out in the last decades extending entropy production to nonequilibrium processes. We experimentally investigate the entropy production of forward-backward cycles containing different decorrelating processes realized to erase different types of correlations between two interacting systems, from obliterating solely quantum coherence to completely decorrelating local states. We apply these processes to the entanglement of a two-level atom, realized with a circular Rydberg atom, and a light field of a high-quality microwave cavity. The entropy production is computed from the full quantum-state tomography of the system performed at different stages of the interaction-decorrelation sequence. Due to the quantum nature of the atom-cavity system, we find that, although standard, the maximum likelihood estimation method for the density matrix leads to spurious divergences of the entropy production. We propose and implement an alternative estimator that remedies such divergences. Our work experimentally assesses irreversibility of non-thermal processes and addresses the care that must be taken in handling experimental data to estimate the entropy production.</p>

While our numeric solutions assume a strong laser field, the analytic solutions indicate that negative state coupling remains dominant for arbitrary low field amplitudes, where in the single-photon case (Compton scattering) negative state coupling can be mathematically associated with the interaction of a virtual electron-positron pair in the context of a quantized theory in old-fashioned perturbation theory.</p>

Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks.</p>

            <p>This chapter reexamines wave function realism (WFR) through the lens of phenomenology. We begin by situating WFR within the broader debate about the ontology of the quantum state and the temptation to "read off" metaphysics from mathematical formalism. Against this background, we turn to the London-Bauer interpretation (LBI), the most explicit attempt to interpret quantum mechanics through phenomenological categories. On this view, the measurement transition is not a physical discontinuity but a reflective articulation of objectivity, and the wave function formally encodes the horizonal structure of world-givenness. We develop this idea by reconfiguring the notion of realism itself: not as objectivist, but as correlational and transcendental. The resulting picture suggests that quantum mechanics, rather than depicting a world "minus observers," mathematically articulates the very correlation through which a world becomes manifest at all.</p>

            <p>We propose a theoretical scheme for controlling the Goos-Hänchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a polariton optomechanical system. The system comprises an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and $N$ excitonic modes, where excitons couple to molecular vibrations via conditional displacement interactions and to photons through electric dipole interactions. We show that the effective exciton-vibration coupling provides a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control: in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS. Our results establish a framework for probing the GHS in polariton optomechanical systems and offer new avenues for designing optical devices that exploit beam-displacement phenomena.</p>

            <p>Clock transitions are well known in atomic and solid-state systems, but are largely unexplored in molecular liquids. Here we demonstrate a clock-like, nuclear-spin avoided crossing in [1--$^{13}$C]-fumarate that supports long-lived and directly observable coherences at ultralow magnetic field: a three-spin transition $|S_0\alpha\rangle \leftrightarrow |T_{+1}\beta\rangle$ near 400 nT exhibits a shallow crossing with a frequency minimum of 2 Hz. The transition is first-order immune to magnetic field perturbations and displays a lifetime of 25 s, around three times the longest single-spin $T_2^*$. Sensitivity to effective pseudo-fields is also demonstrated, including the internal dipolar field of the sample.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Tabarelli de Fatis, Stephanie Matern, Gianluca Rastelli, Iacopo Carusotto</p>
            <p>We investigate superconducting transmission lines as a novel platform for realizing a quantum fluid of microwave photons in a propagating geometry. We predict that the strong photon-photon interactions provided by the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions are sufficient to enter a regime of strongly interacting photons for realistic parameters. A suitable tapering of the transmission line parameters allows for the adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons close to its ground state. Signatures of the strong correlations are anticipated in the correlation properties of the transmitted light.</p>

            <p>Most numerical methods for time integration use real-valued time steps. Complex time steps, however, can provide an additional degree of freedom, as we can select the magnitude of the time step in both the real and imaginary directions. We show that specific paths in the complex time plane lead to expanded stability regions, providing clear computational advantages for complex-valued systems. In particular, we highlight the Schrödinger equation, for which complex time integrators can be uniquely optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these benefits extend to certain classes of real-valued stiff systems by coupling complex time steps with the Projective Integration method.</p>

            <h2>Phase transition, phase separation and mode softening of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Ying Lin, Wei Qin, Renyuan Liao</p>
            <p>We investigate the superradiant phase transition in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with distinct atomic detunings, confined in an optical cavity and driven by a transverse pump laser. By combining perturbation theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the phase transition is dominated by the red-detuned component, resulting in a phase diagram completely different from that of a single-component case under blue-detuned condition. The system exhibits spontaneous phase separation between the two components, manifested as alternating stripe patterns in the normal phase and distinct Bragg gratings in the superradiant phase. Furthermore, the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum reveals roton-type mode softening, indicating that the phase transition also corresponds to the superfluid-to-lattice supersolid transition. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between atomic detunings and collective quantum many-body phenomena, offering potential applications in quantum simulation and optical switching technologies.</p>

            <p>Analog coprocessors are intensively developing nowadays with the aim to optimize energy computations of neural networks. In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline L. Jones, Stefan L. Ludescher, Albert Aloy, Markus P. Mueller</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a fundamental relation between the structures of physical space and of quantum theory: the set of quantum correlations in a rotational prepare-and-measure scenario can be derived from covariance alone, without assuming quantum physics. To show this, we consider a semi-device-independent randomness generation scheme where one of two spatial rotations is performed on an otherwise uncharacterized preparation device, and one of two possible measurement outcomes is subsequently obtained. An upper bound on a theory-independent notion of spin is assumed for the transmitted physical system. It turns out that this determines the set of quantum correlations and the amount of certifiable randomness in this setup exactly. Interestingly, this yields the basis of a theory-independent protocol for the secure generation of random numbers. Our results support the conjecture that the symmetries of space and time determine at least part of the probabilistic structure of quantum theory.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Lattice Hamiltonian Encoding for the Shortest Vector Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eden Schirman, Cong Ling, Florian Mintert</p>
            <p>The advent of quantum computing necessitates the transition of worldwide cryptosystems to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which is founded upon the problem of finding short vectors in high-dimensional structured lattices. It is assumed that the structure of these lattices cannot be exploited by quantum or classical algorithms attempting to find short vectors. In this work, we focus on the structure of the lattices used in PQC protocols - nega-cyclic (and cyclic)lattices - and provide a quantum algorithmic framework that efficiently encodes the structured lattices into Hamiltonians by exploiting their underlying symmetries. The efficient encoding substantially reduces the dimension of the corresponding Hilbert space by limiting it to a relevant subspace where short vectors are likely to be found - leading to significant savings in quantum resources (e.g. qubit count and circuit depth) required to implement a quantum algorithm for finding short vectors. We analytically prove the efficient encoding procedure and benchmark the proposed framework using the variational quantum eigensolver, demonstrating improved results with reduced quantum resources.</p>

            <p>The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tzu-Hsuan Huang, Yeong-Luh Ueng</p>
            <p>Recent research has shown that syndrome-based belief propagation using layered scheduling (sLBP) can not only accelerate the convergence rate but also improve the error rate performance by breaking the quantum trapping sets for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, showcasing a result distinct from classical error correction codes. In this paper, we consider edge-wise informed dynamic scheduling (IDS) for QLDPC codes based on syndrome-based residual belief propagation (sRBP). However, the construction of QLDPC codes and the identical prior intrinsic information assignment will result in an equal residual in many edges, causing a performance limitation for sRBP. Two heuristic strategies, including edge pool design and error pre-correction, are introduced to tackle this obstacle and quantum trapping sets. Then, a novel sRBP equipped with a predict-and-reduce-error mechanism (PRE-sRBP) is proposed, which can provide over one order of performance gain on the considered bicycle codes and symmetric hypergraph (HP) code under similar iterations compared to sLBP.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Lamberto, Gabriele Orlando, Salvatore Savasta</p>
            <p>The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.</p>

Towards helping the reader to spot trends and pick winners, we have surveyed the various families of optically addressable spin qubits and attempted to benchmark and identify the most promising ones in each. We go on to reveal further trends that demonstrate how qubit lifetimes depend on the material's synthesis, the concentration/distribution of its embedded qubits, and the experimental conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo B. Tanaka, Goro Oohata, Takayuki Uozumi</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigated the mechanism of quantum entanglement between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ XEPECS process for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$. In the calculation, we used a realistic $\rm TiO_{6}$-type cluster model with the full multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between the Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. We found that quantum entanglement occurs between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons and that it depends on the angular geometry in the XEPECS process. In addition, we found that the degree of spin and polarization entanglement decreases as the Ti 3$d\ $- O 2$p$ hybridization becomes stronger and as the crystal field modifies the electronic states in terms of the tangle, an index for the degree of entanglement. These results highlight the crucial role of the charge transfer and crystal field effects in determining entanglement properties in real material systems.</p>

            <p>Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used for this purpose; with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (\SI{3}{\micro\meter} gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal. These results will inform nanofabrication for other superconducting materials and the integration of magnetic materials for hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>The advection-diffusion equation is simulated on a superconducting quantum computer via several quantum algorithms. Three formulations are considered: (1) Trotterization, (2) variational quantum time evolution (VarQTE), and (3) adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS). These schemes were originally developed for the Hamiltonian simulation of many-body quantum systems. The finite-difference discretized operator of the transport equation is formulated as a Hamiltonian and solved without the need for ancillary qubits. Computations are conducted on a quantum simulator (IBM Qiskit Aer) and an actual quantum hardware (IBM Fez). The former emulates the latter without the noise. The predicted results are compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data with infidelities of the order $10^{-5}$. In the quantum simulator, Trotterization is observed to have the lowest infidelity and is suitable for fault-tolerant computation. The AVQDS algorithm requires the lowest gate count and the lowest circuit depth. The VarQTE algorithm is the next best in terms of gate counts, but the number of its optimization variables is directly proportional to the number of qubits. Due to current hardware limitations, Trotterization cannot be implemented, as it has an overwhelming large number of operations. Meanwhile, AVQDS and VarQTE can be executed, but suffer from large errors due to significant hardware noise. These algorithms present a new paradigm for computational transport phenomena on quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) offer a promising approach to combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are scalable and robust, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to diverse real-world problems. To address this, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by GraphSAGE, using quantum models as aggregators. We integrate inductive representation learning techniques with parameterized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, allowing tailored designs for specific tasks. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, our framework, using a single minimal circuit for all aggregation steps, handles molecules with varying numbers of atoms without changing qubits or circuit architecture. While classical GNNs achieve higher training performance, our quantum approach remains competitive and often shows stronger generalization as molecular complexity increases. We also observe faster learning in early training epochs. To mitigate trainability limitations of a single-circuit setup, we extend the framework with multiple quantum aggregators on QM9. Assigning distinct circuits to each hop substantially improves training performance across all cases. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus as qubit numbers increase, suggesting that the proposed model can scale to larger, more complex graph-based problems.</p>

            <p>To utilize higher-dimensional quantum systems, in this Letter, we derive a generalized cross-resonance (GCR) scheme for realizing maximally entangling two-qutrit gates on fixed-frequency transmons beyond the 0-1 subspace. Our two-qutrit gates, namely, $U_{CR}^{01}$ and $U_{CR}^{12}$, acting on the $0{\text -}1$ and $1{\text -}2$ energy transitions of transmons, respectively, directly allow for entanglement on the $1{\text -}2$ levels. Unlike the known works, our gate is parametric in nature, enabling us to construct multiple entangling gates of interest. By performing simulations in Qiskit, we demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$X$ ($U_{CX}^{01}$ and $U_{CX}^{12}$) and controlled-$H$ ($U_{CH}^{01}$ and $U_{CH}^{12}$) gates, which are instances of the proposed $U_{CR}$ gates, with reported gate fidelities of $86.14\%~(99.73\%),~84.6\%~(97.88\%),~92.35\%~(99.39\%)$, and $91.99\%~(98.99\%)$, respectively with (and without) noise. We also reveal a two-qutrit Bell state with a fidelity of $99.06 \pm 0.01\%$, with a complete Bell state preparation in a $\sim514$ ns pulse sequence, which is less than the gate time of the known scheme by cross-Kerr-based entangling gates.</p>

            <p>So far, certifying quantum devices from their input-output statistics, under minimal assumptions, required the preparation of specific pure quantum states. Recently, Xu et al. [Phys.

Here, we address this problem and present an experimentally robust method that eliminates the need of preparing states with high fidelity with respect to specific pure states. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by experimentally certifying photonic devices implementing Peres' set of 24 ququart observables [J. Phys. A 24, L175 (1991)] and Yu and Oh's set of 13 qutrit observables [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 030402 (2012)], using maximally mixed states as input. This approach offers a crucial advantage for certifying high-dimensional quantum systems, since it works with maximally mixed and thermal states.</p>

            <p>Quantum advantage schemes probe the boundary between classically simulatable and classically intractable quantum dynamics. We explore the impact of mid-circuit measurements on the computational power of quantum circuits. To this effect, we focus on quantum sampling and introduce a constant-depth measurement-driven approach for efficiently sampling from a broad class of commuting diagonal quantum circuits and associated structured phase states, previously requiring polynomial-depth unitary circuits. By interleaving mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward in randomized "fan-out staircases", our dynamical circuits bypass Lieb-Robinson light-cone constraints, enabling global entanglement with flexible auxiliary qubit usage on bounded-degree lattices (e.g., two-dimensional grids). The generated phase states exhibit random-matrix statistics and anti-concentration comparable to fully random architectures. We further demonstrate measurement-driven feature maps that distinguish phases of an extended SSH model from random eigenstates in a quantum machine-learning benchmark (reservoir computing). Technologically, our results harness mid-circuit measurements to realize quantum advantages on bounded-degree hardware with a favorable topology. Conceptually, they provide complexity-theoretic support for quantum speedups by mid-circuit measurements.</p>

At the nanoscale, where fluctuations and quantum effects matter, there is no unique thermodynamic framework because thermodynamic quantities such as heat and work depend on the accessibility of the degrees of freedom. We derive a thermodynamic framework for coherently driven systems, where the output light is assumed to be accessible. The resulting second law of thermodynamics is strictly tighter than the conventional one and it demands the output light to be more noisy than the input light. We illustrate our framework across several well-established models and we show how the three-level maser can be understood as an engine that reduces the noise of a coherent drive. Our framework opens a new avenue for investigating the noise properties of driven-dissipative quantum systems.</p>

By incorporating this shift in the energy cost function, we show that the LPF control can achieve the minimum phonon occupation number that is lower than cold damping with a band-pass filter, that with delayed feedback, and linear--quadratic--Gaussian (LQG) control, the last two of which are the standard methods of ground-state cooling of a levitated nanoparticle. For the detection efficiency of $90\%$, the achievable phonon occupation number with the LPF control is about one third, two fifths and one half of that of cold damping with a band-pass filter, that with delayed feedback, and LQG control, respectively. Thus our method has a decisive advantage to reach the absolute ground state.</p>

            <p>Unitary errors, such as those arising from fault-tolerant compilation of quantum algorithms, systematically bias observable estimates. Correcting this bias typically requires additional resources, such as an increased number of non-Clifford gates. In this work, we present an alternative method for correcting bias in the expectation values of observables. The method leverages a decomposition of the ideal quantum channel into a probabilistic mixture of noisy quantum channels. Using this decomposition, we construct unbiased estimators as weighted sums of expectation values obtained from the noisy channels. We provide a detailed analysis of the method, identify the conditions under which it is effective, and validate its performance through numerical simulations. In particular, we demonstrate unbiased observable estimation in the presence of unitary errors by simulating the time dynamics of the Ising Hamiltonian. Our strategy offers a resource-efficient way to reduce the impact of unitary errors, improving methods for estimating observables in noisy near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant implementation of quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked' to the photoelectron's spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality while the latter is reminiscent of the Rashba effect in solids</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyungmin Lee, Sunkyu Yu, Jiyong Kang, Seungwoo Yu, Wonhyeong Choi, Daun Chung, Sumin Park, Taehyun Kim</p>
            <p>We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice (FSL) of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the FSL, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the FSL, we introduce a physically motivated and directly measurable topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, computed using a phase-space parameter, is related to the invariant. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected spin states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivia Pomerenk, Charles S. Peskin</p>
            <p>This study aims to address the nature of state change, measurement, and probabilistic outcomes in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We consider a pair of particles that interact in a one-dimensional setting via a delta-function potential. One of the particles is confined to a one-dimensional box, and the other particle is free. The free particle is incident from the left with specified energy, and it may cause changes in state of the confined particle before flying away to the left or to the right. We present a formulation and computational scheme that avoids the use of perturbation theory and determines the probability of any such outcome as a function of the initial state of the confined particle and the energy of the incident particle. As demonstrated by a direct comparison, this presented method holds multiple advantages over a standard perturbative method. The problem formulation and corresponding computational scheme may have applications in physical settings which admit one-dimensional scattering, e.g., in the study of quantum wires or quantum dots.</p>

Our method involves the Dyson-Maleev transformation, for which we develop a procedure to circumvent its inherent non-Hermiticity, yielding the extended Bose-Hubbard (EBH) Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the equivalence of this approach to the Holstein-Primakoff encoding for spin-1/2 systems. For the experimental realization of this EBH model, we design a scalable circuit-QED architecture based on an engineered Josephson junction array. Numerical simulations confirm that the microwave photon dynamics in this simulator accurately reproduces the original spin dynamics. Our work establishes an experimentally accessible method for investigating complex quantum spin dynamics in a highly controllable bosonic setting.</p>

            <h2>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Sherry, Sthitadhi Roy</p>
            <p>Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Fullwood, Zhihao Ma, Zhen Wu</p>
            <p>Contrary to general relativity, quantum theory treats space and time in fundamentally different ways. In particular, while joint probabilities associated with spacelike separated measurements are defined in terms of the Born rule, joint probabilities associated with measurements performed in sequence are defined in terms of the state-update rule. In this work, we show that one obtains a more unified perspective of space and time in quantum theory by embracing a quasiprobabilistic description of sequential measurements. More precisely, we show that there exists a unique \emph{pseudo}-density operator encoding canonical quasiprobabilities associated with sequential measurements in precisely the same manner that a density operator encodes joint probabilities associated with spacelike separated measurements, thus providing a natural extension of the Born rule into the temporal domain. As an application, we show how such a spatiotemporal Born rule combined in conjunction with a quantum Bayes' rule yields an operational notion of time-reversal symmetry for sequential measurements on an \emph{open} quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imre Varga</p>
            <p>Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.</p>

            <h2>Entangling Power and Its Deviation: A Quantitative Analysis on Input-State Dependence and Variability in Entanglement Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyoungho Cho, Jeongho Bang</p>
            <p>Quantifying the entangling capability of quantum operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Traditionally, this capability is measured by the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated when a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states. However, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of entanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric -- entangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement generated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted nature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework that yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis shows that any nontrivial entangling operation necessarily exhibits input-state dependence: nonzero EP implies a nonzero EPD. By analyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical EP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of entanglement generation can significantly differ depending on the gate functionality. Extending our framework to a class of generalized controlled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimensions, we further analyze the interplay between the entangling strength and uniformity, as quantified by EP and EPD. Moreover, we uncover a subtle dimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone fails to detect. These findings highlight EPD as an indispensable diagnostic tool -- one that, alongside EP, provides a deeper and more complete characterization of the entangling structure.</p>

            <p>We consider a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. In a classical setting, this approach is appealing as it guarantees rapid convergence. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and success probabilities of different quantum implementations and provide numerical benchmarks, comparing the performance of the wall-Chebyshev projectors with current state-of-the-art approaches. We find that this approach requires fewer serial applications of the Hamiltonian oracle to achieve a given ground state fidelity, but is severely limited by exponentially decaying success probability. However, we find that some implementations maintain non-trivial success probability in regimes where wall-Chebyshev projection leads to a fidelity improvement over other approaches. As the wall-Chebyshev projector is highly robust to loose known upper bounds on the true ground state energy, it offers a potential resource trade-off, particulary in the early fault-tolerant regime of quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to barren plateaus and sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <p>We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured reservoir acts as a single geometric control that can store, revive, or suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms, offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian devices.</p>

            <p>Periodic driving is used to steer physical systems to unique stationary states or nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), producing enhanced properties inaccessible to non-driven systems. For open quantum systems, characterizing the NESS is challenging and existing results are generally limited to specific types of driving and the Born-Markov approximation. Here we go beyond these limits by studying a generic periodically driven $ N$-level quantum system interacting with a low-density thermal gas. Exploiting the framework of Floquet scattering theory, we establish general Floquet thermalization conditions constraining the nature of the NESS and the transition rates. Moreover, we examine theoretically the structure of the NESS in the high temperature limit, and find out that the NESS complies, rather surprisingly, with an uniform probability distribution (predicted by the Boltzmann law) for any driving. Numerical calculations illustrate our theoretical elaborations for a simple toy model.</p>

            <p>This study investigates quantum-enhanced parameter estimation through continuous monitoring in open quantum systems that exhibit a dissipative time crystal phase. We first analytically derive the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) rate for boundary time crystals (BTCs), demonstrating that within the time-crystal phase, the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$. We then generalize this finding to a broader class of dynamics, including the transverse collective dephasing (TCD) model, which achieves a time-crystal phase through a closing Liouvillian gap without requiring a dissipative phase transition. We proceed to numerically demonstrate that this maximal global QFI rate is experimentally attainable for both the BTC and TCD models, even at finite system sizes, via continuous homodyne and photodetection. Moving towards practical implementations, we analyze the precision limits under inefficient detection, revealing a critical difference: for BTC dynamics, inefficiencies asymptotically restore a classical scaling, and only a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible. In contrast, for TCD dynamics, a super-classical scaling is still in principle observable, and our numerical simulations confirm its presence, even under inefficient measurement conditions, establishing the TCD model as a highly robust platform for quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>The extraction of EPR pairs and n-qubits GHZ states among remote nodes in quantum networks constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand communications. However, the Bell-VM problem, which determines whether a given graph state can be transformed into a set of Bell pairs on specific vertices (not necessarily remote), is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend this problem, not only by focusing on nodes remote within generic graph states, but also by determining the number of extractable n-qubit remote GHZ states -- beside the number of remote EPR pairs. The rationale for tackling the extraction of GHZ states among remote nodes, rather than solely remote EPR pairs, is that a GHZ state enables the dynamic extraction of an EPR pair between any pair of nodes sharing the state. This, in turn, implies the ability of accommodating the traffic requests on-the-fly. Specially, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the aforementioned NP-complete problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively adapt to generic graph states for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.</p>

            <p>We introduce a unified framework -- Quantum Neural Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (QNODEs and QNPDEs) -- which extends the continuous-time formalism of classical neural ordinary and partial differential equations into quantum machine learning and quantum control. QNODEs denote the evolution of finite-dimensional quantum systems, whereas QNPDEs denote their infinite-dimensional (continuous-variable) counterparts; both are governed by generalised Schrödinger-type Hamiltonian dynamics, coupled with a corresponding loss function. This formalism permits gradient estimation via an adjoint-state method, facilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that can be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we present quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time discretisation, achieving efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be intractable on classical devices. We provide detailed resource estimates for these algorithms and investigate the local energy landscape for training. The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state preparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the learning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many cases of interest, the Hamiltonian is composed of a relatively small number of local operators, yet the corresponding classical simulation remains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient estimation. This continuous-time perspective can also serve as a blueprint for designing novel quantum neural network architectures, generalising discrete-layered models into continuous-depth models.</p>

Using a fully fiber-coupled linear-optical platform, we observe a fusion-type four-photon interference signature in the presence of real-world impairments, including photon loss, polarization drift, and timing uncertainty. By performing polarization-resolved measurements on two locally retained photons, we conditionally select distinct two-photon coincidence channels that exhibit Bell-like and N00N-like behavior under an idealized source model. Rather than pursuing multi-partite entanglement verification, this work focuses on establishing the technical feasibility of multi-photon interference and reconfigurable conditional state preparation in an operational network environment.

            <p>Within the familiar circuit-based quantum computational setting, we introduce and analyze a toy model of a quantum physical device capable of internal, self-referential deliberation. The key idea is to represent ``deliberation'' as a coherent iterative branching process, in which competing branch-dependent system evolutions are maintained in superposition, with additional control and memory registers recording branch histories, and the policy register adaptively biasing subsequent development. We provide explicit quantum circuit realizations and carry out detailed step-by-step derivations of the entangled control--memory--system--policy dynamics. We carefully distinguish between internally adaptive and internally reinforced deliberations, proposing the architectures for both, and briefly discuss categorical and controlled--Stinespring reformulations, as well as their conceptual implications. The primary construction models a memory-driven deliberation where the policy update depends on which actions were taken, not on their results. We also present a simple extension that allows for minimalistic, outcome-driven policy updates, implementing a coherent feedback loop that steers the system toward a target state regardless of initial branch-dependent evolution. This loop can be interpreted as a quantum autopilot or search-and-rescue mechanism, illustrating how a device can autonomously correct and optimize its internal strategy in superposition. Finally, we briefly consider various implementations of a dialogue that may take place between two deliberating machines. Taken together, this frames the proposed model as a plausible setting for exploring how such devices may maintain multiple alternatives in parallel, while performing an internal decision-making process through coherent branching, entanglement, adaptive policy updates, and policy-driven self-modifying unitary dynamics.</p>

PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system.

We consider a detector moving along a spatial trajectory within a two-dimensional plane. The quantum systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and which-path distinguishability circuit. Thus, for non-relativistic velocity regime, we obtained analytical expressions such as transition rates, quantum coherence, visibility, distinguishability, and the complementarity relation. On the other hand, for the ultra-relativistic velocity regime, we saw that the Unruh effect is suppressed and therefore the detector does not respond in this case. Our findings revealed that velocity effects imply mitigation of information degradation, this interesting behaviors happen because of the composite effect of both velocity and acceleration. The results obtained show that the addition of the non-relativistic, transverse and constant motion of an accelerated detector can play a protective role in quantumness in systems at high accelerations, although the effects are very small.</p>

            <p>In the $k$-mismatch problem, given a pattern and a text of length $n$ and $m$ respectively, we have to find if the text has a sub-string with a Hamming distance of at most $k$ from the pattern. This has been studied in the classical setting since 1982 and recently in the quantum computational setting by Jin and Nogler and Kociumaka, Nogler, and Wellnitz. We provide a simple quantum algorithm that solves the problem in an approximate manner, given a parameter $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$. It returns an occurrence as a match only if it is a $\left(1+\epsilon\right)k$-mismatch. If it does not return any occurrence, then there is no $k$-mismatch. This algorithm has a time (size) complexity of $\tilde{O}\left( \epsilon^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{mn}{k}} \right)$.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Filtering at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Gough</p>
            <p>We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</p>

            <h2>A quantum state transfer protocol with Ising Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar Michel, Matthias Werner, Arnau Riera</p>
            <p>Quantum state transfer is a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation, where fast and reliable communication between distant subsystems is essential. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum state transfer in linear Ising chains. Starting from a perfect state transfer scheme via a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous couplings, we adapt it for architectures implementing the transverse-field Ising model by encoding the information in domain walls. The resulting linear Ising chain makes quantum transport experiments accessible to many platforms for analog quantum simulation. We test the protocol for 1-, 2-, and 3- spin states, obtaining high transfer fidelities of up to 0.99 and study the accuracy dependence on the domain wall approximation. These results are the first step in paving the way for an experimental implementation of the protocol.</p>

Our algorithm is polynomial in the number of samples and computational time, and requires only constant depth circuits. This result extends previous work on the abelian StateHSP and, as a special case, provides a solution for the ordinary hidden subgroup problem on this specific non-abelian group.</p>

            <h2>An Information-Minimal Geometry for Qubit-Efficient Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gordon Ma, Dimitris G. Angelakis</p>
            <p>Qubit-efficient optimization studies how large combinatorial problems can be addressed with quantum circuits whose width is far smaller than the number of logical variables. In quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), objective values depend only on one- and two-body statistics, yet standard variational algorithms explore exponentially large Hilbert spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometric question: what is the minimal representation the objective itself requires? Focusing on QUBO problems, we show that enforcing mutual consistency among pairwise statistics defines a convex body -- the level-2 Sherali-Adams polytope -- that captures the information on which quadratic objectives depend. We operationalize this geometry in a minimal variational pipeline that separates representation, consistency, and decoding: a logarithmic-width circuit produces pairwise moments, a differentiable information projection enforces local feasibility, and a maximum-entropy ensemble provides a principled global decoder. This information-minimal construction achieves near-optimal approximation ratios on large unweighted Max-Cut instances (up to N=2000) at shallow depth, indicating that pairwise polyhedral geometry already captures the relevant structure in this regime. By making the information-minimal geometry explicit, this work establishes a clean baseline for qubit-efficient optimization and sharpens the question of where genuinely quantum structure becomes necessary.</p>

Neutral atom hardware is a promising choice of platform for implementing quantum walks due to its ability to implement native multiqubit ($\geq\!3$-qubit) gates and to dynamically re-arrange qubits. Using error modelling for multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid passage, we present the gate sequences and predicted final state fidelities for some toy quantum walks, including `lazy' quantum walks. These `lazy' quantum walks include a rest state and therefore provide an integral step towards quantum walks for fluid simulation.</p>

            <h2>From Device to Dynamics: An Iterative Architectural Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Shu</p>
            <p>Photon detection is a cornerstone of quantum technology, traditionally regarded as a static device-level operation constrained by the intrinsic physical properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). Consequently, high-performance detection has been heavily reliant on superconducting technologies, whose requirement for cryogenic temperatures imposes significant infrastructure burdens and limits scalable deployment. To circumvent these constraints, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detection (ESPD) framework, which shifts the photon-detection paradigm from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing (QIP) task. By incorporating state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy decision analysis, we establish a nonlinear dynamical model that reformulates detection as an iteratively enhanced process. This architecture enables systematic performance upgrades through structural design rather than material modification, allowing high-performance detection with exclusively room-temperature hardware. Through analytical approximations, Monte Carlo analysis, and numerical simulations, we show that the ESPD dynamics converge to a high-performance basin of attraction even when initialized by low-performance SPDs. While physical realization requires further component integration efforts, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing detection via architectural QIP principles. It provides not only a blueprint for next-generation room-temperature photon detection but also a general methodology for transcending device-level constraints in broader quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Automated Compilation Including Dropouts: Tolerating Defective Components in Stabiliser Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stasiu Wolanski</p>
            <p>Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging Symmetry Merging in Pauli Propagation</h2>

            <p>We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Dincă, Tim Chan, Simon C. Benjamin</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.</p>

            <p>Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Electrons bound to shallow donors in ZnSe quantum wells are promising candidates for optically addressable spin qubits and single-photon sources. However, their optical coherence and indistinguishability are often limited by spectral broadening arising from charge fluctuations in the local environment. Here, we report electrical control of single donor qubits in ZnSe quantum wells. The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression. Our results identify electrical control as a versatile pathway to significantly improve optical and spin addressability.</p>

            <h2>Partial Collapse and Ensemble Invariance under Continuous Quantum Measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalender Singh, Santosh Kumar</p>
            <p>Wavefunction collapse is commonly associated with unavoidable physical disturbance of the measured system. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can induce strong trajectory-level collapse while leaving the ensemble-averaged steady state strictly invariant. We identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite pronounced measurement-induced localization in conditioned quantum trajectories. This separation between trajectory-level collapse and ensemble invariance defines a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is continuously counteracted by dissipative dynamics. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and identify Liouvillian symmetry as a concrete dynamical mechanism enforcing it. Our results clarify the distinction between conditional collapse and physical disturbance in open quantum systems and provide a framework for non-invasive continuous monitoring in driven-dissipative settings.</p>

            <p>A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.</p>

            <p>Entanglement distillation and entanglement cost are fundamental tasks in quantum entanglement theory. This work studies both in the probabilistic setting and focuses on the asymptotic error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation when the operational model is $\delta$-approximately nonentangling or $\delta$-approximately dually nonentangling quantum instruments. While recent progress has clarified limitations of probabilistic transformations in general resource theories, an analytic formula for the error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation under approximately (dually) nonentangling operations has remained unavailable. Building on the framework of postselected quantum hypothesis testing, we establish a direct connection between probabilistic distillation and postselected hypothesis testing against the set of separable states. In particular, we derive an analytical characterization of the distillation error exponent under $\delta$-approximately nonentangling quantum instruments. Besides, we relate the exponent to postselected hypothesis testing with measurements restricted to be separable. We further investigate probabilistic entanglement dilution and establish a relation between probabilistic entanglement costs under approximately nonentangling and approximately dually nonentangling instruments, together with a bound on the probabilistic entanglement cost under nonentangling instruments.</p>

            <p>Scalable distributed quantum computing (DQC) has motivated the design of multiple quantum data-center (QDC) architectures that overcome the limitations of single quantum processors through modular interconnection. While these architectures adopt fundamentally different design philosophies, their relative performance under realistic quantum hardware constraints remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmarking study of four representative QDC architectures-QFly, BCube, Clos, and Fat-Tree-quantifying their impact on distributed quantum circuit execution latency, resource contention, and scalability. Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance. Across diverse circuit workloads, we evaluate how architectural properties such as path diversity and path length, and shared BSM (Bell State Measurement) resources interact with optical-switch insertion loss and reconfiguration delay. Our results show that distributed quantum performance is jointly shaped by topology, scheduling policies, and physical-layer parameters, and that these factors interact in nontrivial ways. Together, these insights provide quantitative guidance for the design of scalable and high-performance quantum data-center architectures for DQC.</p>

We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators.

The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</p>

This improves the best previous $\Omega(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence. We show that this scaling is optimal, up to logarithmic farctors, when $d_A=rd_B$.

This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.</p>

            <p>A quantum system that interacts with an environment generally undergoes nonunitary evolution described by a non-Markovian or Markovian master equation. In this paper, we construct the non-Markovian Redfield master equation for a quantum scalar field that interacts with a second field through a bilinear or nonlinear interaction on a Minkowski background. We use the resulting master equation to set up coupled differential equations that can be solved to obtain the equal-time two-point function of the system field. We show how the equations simplify under various approximations including the Markovian limit and argue that the Redfield equation-based solution provides a perturbative resummation to the standard second-order Dyson series result. For the bilinear interaction, we explicitly show that the Redfield solution is closer to the exact solution compared to the perturbation theory-based one. Further, the environment correlation function is oscillatory and nondecaying in this case, making the Markovian master equation a poor approximation. For the nonlinear interaction, on the other hand, the environment correlation function is sharply peaked and the Redfield solution matches that obtained using a Markovian master equation in the late-time limit.</p>

The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Yu-Hang Li, Ming Lu, Hongfang Liu, Hailong Li, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulations of Chemical Reactions: Achieving Accuracy with NISQ Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitreyee Sarkar, Lisa Roy, Akash Gutal, Atul Kumar, Manikandan Paranjothy</p>
            <p>Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</p>

            <h2>Frustration-free free fermions and beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rintaro Masaoka, Seishiro Ono, Hoi Chun Po, Haruki Watanabe</p>
            <p>Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</p>

            <p>We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].</p>

            <p>The development of large-scale, programmable photonic circuits capable of performing generic matrix-vector multiplication is essential for both classical and quantum information processing. However, this goal is hindered by high losses, hardware errors, and difficulties in programmability. We propose an enhanced architecture for programmable photonic circuits that minimizes circuit depth and offers analytical programmability, properties that have not been simultaneously achieved in previous circuit designs. Our proposal exploits a previously overlooked representation of general nonunitary matrices as sums of two unitaries. Furthermore, similar to the traditional singular value decomposition-based circuits, the circuits in our unitary-sum-based architecture inherit the advantages of the constituent unitary circuits. Overall, our proposal provides a significantly improved solution for matrix-vector multiplication compared to the established approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Han Zhang, Yang Li, Himadri Pathak, Takeshi Sato, Kenichi L. Ishikawa, Feng He</p>
            <p>We introduce a framework for resolving electron-hole dynamics within wavefunction-based multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. Central to this framework is a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem, which rigorously defines time-dependent hole states through single-electron removal. From this foundation, we prove the existence of exact equations of motion for time-dependent Dyson orbitals, enabling instantaneous construction of photofragments' reduced density matrices. The formalism further yields a systematic procedure to extract hole-resolved observables, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions, directly from time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions. As a demonstration, we employ an attosecond $\omega-2\omega$ laser strategy to control hole dynamics, thereby resolving a long-standing challenge in MCTDHF simulations. This advance opens a pathway for exploring correlated multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules under ultrafast laser fields.</p>

            <h2>Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pui In Ip, Shina Tan</p>
            <p>We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schrödinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.</p>

            <p>Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</p>

            <h2>Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.</p>

Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Giacchi</p>
            <p>Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</p>

Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</p>

            <h2>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chinonso Onah, Roman Firt, Kristel Michielsen</p>
            <p>We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r >= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.</p>

            <h2>Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Nolland</p>
            <p>This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic-stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</p>

            <p>Cloud-accessible quantum processors enable direct execution of quantum algorithms on heterogeneous hardware platforms. Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times. In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors. These findings highlight the importance of hardware-aware algorithm selection and provide practical guidance for benchmarking in the NISQ era.</p>

Despite a growing body of temporal state formalisms, their precise operational relationships and conceptual distinctions remain unclear. In this work, we resolve this issue by extending the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution to arbitrary multi-time quantum processes and, more broadly, to general spatiotemporal settings. We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes. By characterizing their nonclassical features, we show that the generalized KD framework provides a unified operational foundation for a wide class of temporal state approaches and can be directly implemented via temporal or spatiotemporal Bloch tomography.</p>

In the present work, we study the breaking of Quantum Darwinism in a specific model and how that translates to non-classical measurement statistics. Interestingly, this provides effective tools for benchmarking the genuine quantum characteristics of NISQ hardware, which we demonstrate with IonQ's trapped-ion and IBM's superconducting quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>Within the Segal-Bargmann representation, a generalized Rabi model is considered that includes both two-photon and asymmetric terms. It is shown that, through a suitable transformation, nearly exact solutions can be obtained using the Bethe ansatz approach. Applying this approach to the meromorphic structure of the resulting differential equation, solutions in exact analytical form of the fourth-order problem are presented for both an arbitrary state and for the restriction between the parameters.</p>

            <p>We report a three-dimensional lumped-element multimode microwave resonator that enables homogeneous collective manipulation and dispersive readout of a macroscopic spin ensemble. By exploiting geometric symmetry, two antisymmetric modes with strongly suppressed cross-talk are engineered to spatially overlap and couple to the same ensemble at distinct frequencies. Using negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond at 28 mK, we observe collective strong coupling with a coupling strength of 5.0 MHz and demonstrate non-destructive dispersive readout via a detuned mode. The compact design, tunable coupling, and high field homogeneity make this resonator a versatile device for hybrid spin-photon systems and multimode solid-state quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We observe time-correlated four photons within a correlation window of 20ns from spontaneous four-wave mixing via a double-Lambda scheme in a cold cloud of Rb-87 atoms. In contrast to high-power pulsed pumping of chi^(2) nonlinear processes in crystals, our scheme generates correlated four-photon states by direct continuous-wave pumping at nominal powers. We verify the presence of genuinely correlated four-photon states over accidentals by higher-order intensity cross-correlation measurements and accidental subtraction. We infer a time-correlated four-photon generation rate of 2.5(4)x10^6 counts per second close to saturation. The photons produced are near-resonant with atomic transitions, and have a bandwidth in the order of MHz, making them readily compatible with quantum networking applications involving atoms.</p>

            <h2>Bath-free squeezed phonon lasing via intrinsic ion-phonon coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen-Yu Lee, Guin-Dar Lin</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical model for realizing squeezed lasing in a trapped-ion system without relying on engineered baths or tailored dissipative reservoirs. Our approach leverages the intrinsic ion-phonon interactions, where two trapped ions, each interacting with a shared vibrational mode, are driven on both red- and blue-sideband transitions. This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Zhang, Ying Xia, Xiuxing Zhang, Shoukang Chang, Wei Ye</p>
            <p>We investigate the simultaneous estimation of two optical phases in a three-mode interferometer assisted by optical parametric amplification (OPA). By employing the normally ordered characteristic-function formalism, we analytically obtain all photon-number moments of the output quantum state, enabling an explicit evaluation of the quantum Fisher information matrix for multiparameter phase estimation. In the lossless scenario, we show that uniformly applied OPA significantly enhances the attainable precision beyond that of an unamplified interferometer. By analyzing the second-order correlation functions, we demonstrate that this enhancement originates from the amplification of intra-mode photon-number correlations, rather than from inter-mode correlations. We further extend our analysis to realistic interferometers with photon loss using a purification-based variational approach. Although loss degrades the achievable precision, the OPA-assisted scheme retains a clear advantage for moderate loss, indicating a degree of robustness against dissipation. Our results clarify the physical mechanism underlying OPA-enhanced multiparameter quantum metrology and provide guidelines for optimizing phase estimation protocols in realistic noisy environments.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level system coupled to a photonic waveguide, showing that dynamical dephasing in the photon modes profoundly alters the decay law. In the absence of dephasing, the emitter displays conventional exponential decay followed by a long-time power-law tail -- observable only at extremely low survival probabilities. Strikingly, when dephasing is introduced, a robust power-law decay emerges already at short times, driven by photon diffusion in the dynamically disordered environment rather than spectral edge effects. These results reveal a novel, decoherence-induced mechanism for non-exponential spontaneous emission in waveguide QED platforms.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a scheme to generate squeezed light by storing a classical probe pulse in a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) and exploiting the nonlinear evolution caused by atom--atom collisions during the storage time. A $\Lambda$-type optical memory interface maps a chosen temporal probe mode onto a single phase-matched collective spin wave; for a coherent input this prepares a tunable coherent spin state of a two-component BEC, with its initial spin orientation set by the stored mean excitation number and the phase relation between the probe and control fields. Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble. We account for realistic loss and finite memory and retrieval efficiencies, and model readout as a single-mode beam-splitter mapping that transfers the atomic quadrature squeezing onto a propagating optical mode. We identify optimal storage times and predict that, under realistic conditions, several dB of squeezing can be transferred to the retrieved light.</p>

            <h2>From Superradiance to Superabsorption: An Exact Treatment of Non-Markovian Cooperative Radiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio González, Ángel Rivas</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of cooperative radiation phenomena in ensembles of two-level atoms coupled to a lossy resonant cavity beyond the Markovian and mean-field approximations. By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Lamberto, Gabriele Orlando, Salvatore Savasta</p>
            <p>The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.</p>

            <p>Entanglement detection is a fundamental task in quantum information science, serving as a cornerstone for quantum benchmarking and foundational studies. With an increasing qubit number that can be effectively controlled, there is a pressing need for a scalable and robust detection protocol which requires minimal resources while maintaining high detection capability. By integrating the Positive Partial Transposition criterion with variational quantum interference, we propose an entanglement detection protocol that requires moderate classical and quantum computation resources. We numerically show that this protocol achieves a high detection capability with shallow quantum circuits, surpassing some widely-used entanglement detection methods. The protocol also exhibits strong resilience to circuit noise, ensuring its applicability across different physical platforms. We further demonstrate the protocol experimentally on an eight-photon linear-optical platform, where it successfully detects the entanglement of a three-qubit mixed state that is inaccessible to conventional entanglement witnesses. By combining quantum interference with classical optimization, our protocol provides a scalable and resource-efficient route toward practical entanglement detection.</p>

This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>We present a novel protocol to detect rare signals in a noisy environment using quantum error correction (QEC). The key feature of our protocol is the discrimination between signal and noise through distinct higher-order correlations, realized by the non-linear processing that occurs during syndrome extraction in QEC. In this scheme, QEC has two effects: First, it sacrifices part of the signal $\epsilon$ by recording a reduced, stochastic, logical phase $\phi_L = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$. Second, it corrects the physical noise and extends the (logical) coherence time for signal acquisition. For rare signals occurring at random times in the presence of local Markovian noise, we explicitly demonstrate an improved sensitivity of our approach over more conventional sensing strategies.</p>

We develop interferometric sensing protocols based on quantum critical wavefunctions and compare their performance with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and spin-squeezed states. Building on the idea of symmetries as a metrological resource, we introduce a symmetry-based algorithm to identify optimal measurement strategies. We illustrate this algorithm both for magnetic systems with internal symmetries and Rydberg-atom arrays with spatial symmetries. We study the robustness of criticality for quantum sensing under non-unitary deformations, symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking decoherence, and qubit loss -- identifying regimes where critical systems outperform GHZ states and showing that non-unitary deformation can even enhance sensing precision. Combined with recent results on log-depth preparation of critical wavefunctions, interferometric sensing in this setting appears increasingly promising.</p>

            <p>A bright source of on-demand entangled photons is needed for quantum networks. A single quantum dot in a site-selected nanowire waveguide is a promising candidate for realizing such sources. However, such sources are associated with poor single-photon indistinguishability, limiting their applicability in quantum networks. A common approach for enhancing the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum dot-based entangled photon sources is to implement a broadband optical cavity. Achieving a high-Purcell cavity while retaining the advantages of the nanowire, such as directional emission, a broad operational bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency, has been a significant challenge. Here, we propose a nanowire cavity based on quasi-bound states in the continuum formed by the strong coupling of two resonant optical modes. We numerically predict this design to support a cavity mode with 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of $\sim$17. This cavity mode enables a directional far-field emission profile (88% overlap with a Gaussian) with a light extraction efficiency of $\sim$74%. Our solution opens up a route for generating entangled photon pairs with enhanced extraction efficiency and single-photon indistinguishability for the practical realization of quantum networks.</p>

            <p>The efficient interfacing of quantum emitters and photons is fundamental to quantum networking. Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C>1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout. These results, coupled with GaP's strong nonlinear properties, establish GaP-on-diamond as a scalable planar platform for quantum network applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks connecting quantum processing nodes via photonic links enable distributed and modular quantum computation. In this framework, quantum gates between remote qubits can be realized using quantum teleportation protocols. The essential requirements for such non-local gates are remote entanglement, local quantum logic within each processor, and classical communication between nodes to perform operations based on measurement outcomes. Here, we demonstrate an unconditional Controlled-NOT quantum gate between remote diamond-based qubit devices. The control and target qubits are Carbon-13 nuclear spins, while NV electron spins enable local logic, readout, and remote entanglement generation. We benchmark the system by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, showing genuine 4-partite entanglement shared between nodes. Using deterministic logic, single-shot readout, and real-time feed-forward, we implement non-local gates without post-selection. These results demonstrate a key capability for solid-state quantum networks, enabling exploration of distributed quantum computing and testing of complex network protocols on fully integrated systems.</p>

            <p>Negatively charged boron vacancies (V$_{\text{B}}^{-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) comprise a promising quantum sensing platform, optically addressable at room temperature and transferrable onto samples. However, broad hyperfine-split spin transitions of the ensemble pose challenges for quantum sensing with conventional resonant excitation due to limited spectral coverage. While isotopically enriched hBN using $^{10}$B and $^{15}$N isotopes (h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N) exhibits sharper spectral features, significant inhomogeneous broadening persists. We demonstrate that, implemented via frequency modulation on an FPGA, a frequency-ramped microwave pulse achieves around 4-fold greater $|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ spin-state population transfer and thus contrast than resonant microwave excitation and thus 16-fold shorter measurement time for spin relaxation based quantum sensing. Quantum dynamics simulations reveal that an effective two-state Landau-Zener model captures the complex relationship between population inversion and pulse length with relaxations incorporated. Our approach is robust and valuable for quantum relaxometry with spin defects in hBN in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of noisy quantum circuits using frame representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janek Denzler, Jose Carrasco, Jens Eisert, Tommaso Guaita</p>
            <p>One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgio Facelli, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi</p>
            <p>Simulating the time dynamics of an observable under Hamiltonian evolution is one of the most promising candidates for quantum advantage as we do not expect efficient classical algorithms for this problem except in restricted settings. Here, we introduce such a setting by showing that Majorana Propagation, a simple algorithm combining Trotter steps and truncations, efficiently finds a low-degree approximation of the time-evolved observable as soon as such an approximation exists. This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$. For a time horizon $t \leq t_{\text{max}}(u)$, the runtime of the algorithm is $N^{O(\log(t/\varepsilon))}$ where $N$ is the number of Majorana modes and $\varepsilon$ is the error measured in the normalized Frobenius norm. Importantly, in the limit of small $u$, $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ goes to $+\infty$, formalizing the intuition that the algorithm is accurate at all times when the Hamiltonian is quadratic.</p>

            <p>We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</p>

            <p>Constructing a quantum memory node with the ability of long-distance atom-photon distribution is the essential task for future quantum networks, enabling distributed quantum computing, quantum cryptography and remote sensing. Here we report the demonstration of a quantum-network node with a simple cavity-free cold atomic ensemble. This node gives an initial retrieval efficiency of approximately 50\% and memory lifetime of 160 $\mu$s for atomic qubits. With the aid of a high-efficiency and polarization-independent quantum frequency conversion (QFC) module, the generated entangled photon in the node at 780-nm wavelength is converted to telecom S band at 1522 nm, enabling atom-photon distribution over long distance. We observe an entanglement fidelity between the atoms and telecom photon exceeding 80\% after photon transmission over 20-km fiber, the remaining infidelity being dominated by atomic decoherence. The low-noise QFC with an external efficiency up to 48.5\% gives a signal-to-noise-ratio of 6.9 for transmitted photons with fiber length up to 100 km, laying the cornerstone for entanglement distribution at a hundred-km level.

            <p>While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Fault-tolerant Cat State Preparation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Peham, Erik Weilandt, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Cat states are an important resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing, where they serve as building blocks for a variety of fault-tolerant primitives. Consequently, the ability to prepare high-quality cat states at large fault distances is essential. While optimizations for low fault distances or small numbers of qubits exist, higher fault distances can be achieved via generalized constructions with potentially suboptimal circuit sizes. In this work, we propose a cat state preparation scheme based on preparing two cat states with low-depth circuits, followed by a transversal CNOT and measurement of one of the states. This scheme prepares $w$-qubit cat states fault-tolerantly up to fault distances of $9$ using $\lceil\log_2 w\rceil+1$ depth and at most $3w-2$ CNOTs and $2w$ qubits. We discuss that the combinatorially challenging aspect of this construction is the precise wiring of the transversal CNOT and propose three methods for finding these: two based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory solving and one heuristic search based on a local repair strategy. Numerical evaluations show that our circuits achieve a high fault-distance while requiring fewer resources as generalized constructions.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian dynamics of the giant atom beyond the rotating-wave approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mei Yu, Walter T. Strunz, Stefan Nimmrichter</p>
            <p>Superconducting qubits coupled to meandering transmission lines or surface acoustic waves may realize giant artificial atoms, whose spatially separated coupling points give rise to long-lived non-Markovian dynamics. Previous studies were limited to the zero-temperature, weak-coupling regime, where the rotating-wave approximation applies and only single-phonon processes contribute. Here we go beyond these limits using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). We show that HEOM accurately captures the exact dynamics at zero temperature and weak coupling, whereas perturbative Redfield theory fails due to long bath memory times. The non-Markovian effects persist at finite temperatures. In the strong-coupling regime, they are further enhanced, and we observe bound-state formation at zero temperature with only two coupling points. These results establish giant atoms as a powerful platform for exploring non-Markovian open quantum dynamics and their applications in quantum information and thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Multiphoton Interference with a symmetric SU(N) beam splitter and the generalization of the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M. Alsing, Richard J. Birrittella, Peter L. Kaulfuss</p>
            <p>We examine multiphoton interference with a symmetric $SU(N)$ beam splitter $S_N$, an extension of features of the $SU(2)$ 50/50 beam splitter extended Hong-Ou-Mandel (eHOM) effect, whereby one obtains a zero amplitude (probability) for the output coincidence state (defined by equal number of photons $n/N$ in each output port), when a total number $n$ of photons impinges on the $N$-port device. These are transitions of the form $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$, where $n=\sum_{i=1}^N n_i$, which generalize the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect $|1,1\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|1,1\rangle $, the eHOM effect $|n_1,n_2\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2},\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2}\rangle $, and the generalized HOM effect (gHOM) $|1\rangle^{\otimes N}\overset{S_N}{\to}|1\rangle^{\otimes N}$, which have previously been studied in the literature. The emphasis of this work is on illuminating how the overall destructive interference occurs in separate groups of destructive interferences of sub-amplitudes of the total zero amplitude. We develop symmetry properties for the generalized eHOM effect (geHOM) $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$ involving a zero amplitude governed by Perm($\Lambda$)=0, for an appropriately constructed matrix $\Lambda(S_N)$ built from the matrix elements of $S_N$. We develop an analytical constraint equation for Perm$(\Lambda)$ for arbitrary $N$ that allows us to determine when it is zero. We generalize the SU(2) beam splitter feature of central nodal line (CNL), which has a zero diagonal along the output probability distribution when one of the input states is of odd parity (containing only odd number of photons), to the general case of $N = 2 * N'$ where $N'\in odd$.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid non-degenerate parametric amplifier for a microwave cavity mode and an NV ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Ovsiannikov, Kurt Jacobs, Andrii G. Sotnikov, Matthew E. Trusheim, Denys I. Bondar</p>
            <p>We introduce an implementation of a non-degenerate parametric amplifier in which the signal and idler modes, respectively, a microwave mode and an ensemble of spins (e.g., nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond), are operated in their linear regime. This paramp, which amplifies signals in both parts at room and cryogenic temperatures, can be used to generate both the two-mode and single-mode squeezing of either system. It requires merely modulating the frequency of the spin ensemble at the sum of the cavity and spin frequencies (providing the classical pump) with the two systems sufficiently detuned. This effect is remarkable given that modulating a spin ensemble by itself produces neither amplification nor squeezing, unlike modulating an oscillator, and that an off-resonant perturbative analysis would suggest that modulating the spin ensemble merely parametrically drives the cavity mode. With typical cavity parameters including a cavity quality factor~$Q=10^4$, and a 1 GHz modulation amplitude, the microwave signal can be amplified by approximately $18~\mbox{dB}$ in $1.7~\mbox{$\mu$s}$, with a resonant bandwidth of about $0.5~\mbox{MHz}$. At $10~\mbox{mK}$ with the same modulation amplitude and a cavity and spin $Q=5\times 10^4$ it generates approximately $5~\mbox{dB}$ of squeezing. We also examine the experimental requirements for implementation.</p>

            <p>Many symmetry protected or symmetry enriched phases of quantum matter have the property that every ground state in a given such phase endows measurement based quantum computation with the same computational power. Such phases are called computational phases of quantum matter. Here, we experimentally verify four theoretical predictions for them on an IBM superconducting quantum device. We comprehensively investigate how symmetric imperfections of the resource states translate into logical decoherence, and how this decoherence is mitigated. In particular, the central experiment probes the scaling law from which the uniformity of computational power follows. We also analyze the correlated regime, where local measurements give rise to logical operations collectively. We test the prediction that densest packing of a measurement-based algorithms remains the most efficient, in spite of the correlations. Our experiments corroborate the operational stability of measurement based quantum computation in quantum phases of matter with symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Tailoring Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions via Double-Mode Squeezing Manipulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Cao, Haodong Wang, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Shu chen, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a protocol to tailor dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) by double-mode squeezing onto the initial state in the XY chain. The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=\pi/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $\pi$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication</h2>

            <p>Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</p>

            <h2>Extracting scattering phase shift in quantum mechanics on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Guo, Paul LeVan, Frank X. Lee, Yong Zhao</p>
            <p>We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.</p>

            <p>We present an optical study of near-surface Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in waveguide-integrated CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$, investigating how nanophotonic coupling modifies rare-earth spectroscopy. In particular, we compare bulk excitation with evanescently coupled TE and TM waveguide modes. In Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$, we observe a pronounced polarization-dependent surface effect. TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts. These observations suggest that non-charge-neutral rare-earth systems are more susceptible to surface-induced decoherence sources than charge-neutral hosts.</p>

            <h2>Unitary Transformation of Two-Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manish Kumar Mohanta</p>
            <p>The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.</p>

Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy data reveal the presence of a double-peak low-energy feature in the local density of states of the hybrid system, which is rationalized via model calculations to be an emergent topological nodal-point superconducting phase with tilted Weyl cones.

            <p>We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom inside a high-quality cavity and show that they can be extensively tuned by adjusting the cavity resonance and the rotation frequency. Crucially, while inertial atoms cannot be excited in vacuum, rotation induces spontaneous excitation via the circular Unruh effect, with the cavity serving only as an amplifier. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach $\sim 10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ while emission remains negligible, enabling substantial population inversion. In another scenario, both excitation and emission can simultaneously attain $\sim 10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, corresponding to millions of transitions per second for a single atom. These findings highlight a powerful method for manipulating atomic transition rates for quantum applications and open a promising route toward experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect with state-of-the-art quantum technologies.</p>

We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation.</p>

Otherwise, the satellite up-link can be rerouted to the ground nodes to form a pair-wise ground network. Leveraging both the time and frequency correlations of our photon-pair source, we demonstrate an increased coincidence-to-accidental ratio without additional resource overhead in a five-node network. To contextualize these experimental findings, we project their performance in a quantum key distribution scenario and outline a feasible route toward field deployment, using integrated photonics to enable network integration of up to 72 users.</p>

The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</p>

            <p>We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</p>

            <p>Four decades after Richard Feynman's famous remark, we have reached a stage at which nature can be simulated quantum mechanically. Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, like many quantum algorithms, it is severely constrained by noise in near-term hardware. Quantum-inspired algorithms provide an attractive alternative by avoiding the need for error-prone quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate that the coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation algorithms can accurately reproduce the electronic energy profiles of H_2 and H_2O, capturing their essential energetic features. Notably, we obtain computational times of 1.2 s and 2.4 s for the H_2 and H_2O profiles, respectively, representing a substantial speed-up compared to gate-based quantum computing approaches, which typically require at least 6 s to compute a single molecular geometry with comparable accuracy.

            <p>Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles through the \emph{inter-flavor mutual information}, an experimentally accessible quantity that rigorously measures the distance from the closest gaussian state, unveiling features that cannot be accessed by conventional probes of Mottness. We prove that these correlations are fully independent from local entanglement and quantum discord, and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Ji, Dengfeng Wang, Tong Zhou, Xiaosen Yang</p>
            <p>We show that proximity to an altermagnet provides an efficient route to engineering non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases. The proximity-induced altermagnetic order gaps the edge states of a topological insulator, thereby driving a transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner states become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.</p>

            <p>First, the study tries to shed light on the relationship between purely quantum mechanical momentum measurements (canonical momentum space) and measurements of the generalized momentum operator, including minimal length effects. Additionally, the existence of complex numbers in quantum mechanics seems justifiable as a consequence of minimal length. Finally, a novel method for generating quantum entangled states with complex quantum numbers inspired by the minimal length is also reported. Therefore, theories including a minimal length, like some quantum scenarios of gravity, seem to be able to enrich the current understanding of non-locality.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational time dilation in quantum clock interferometry with entangled multi-photon states and quantum memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Gündoğan, Roy Barzel, Dennis Rätzel</p>
            <p>Gravitational time dilation implies that clocks held at different heights accumulate different proper times. We analyze a memory-assisted quantum clock interferometer in which a frequency-bin photonic clock is stored in two vertically separated quantum memories for a controllable duration, such that the joint state evolves in a quantum superposition of two proper times. After retrieval, the photonic modes interfere in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, for which we derive analytic expressions for the resulting multiphoton detection statistics. Extending this HOM-based scheme from entangled photon pairs to frequency-entangled 2N-photon inputs, we show that the proper-time dependent phase is amplified by a factor N, leading to an N-times faster collapse and revival of the interference signal compared with the two-photon case. Incorporating finite memory efficiency and lifetime, we identify regimes where this modulation remains observable. For parameters compatible with demonstrated Rb and Cs memories and achievable optical frequency separations, the first collapse occurs for height differences in the order of 10-100 m with subsecond to few-second storage times, while suitable rare-earth ion and alkali memory combinations can reduce the required height to the few-metre scale. These results establish near-term laboratory conditions for observing entanglement dynamics driven by gravitational time dilation in a photonic platform.</p>

            <h2>Gaussian time-translation covariant operations: structure, implementation, and thermodynamics</h2>

            <p>Time-translation symmetry strongly constrains physical dynamics, yet systematic characterization for continuous-variable systems lags behind its discrete-variable counterpart. We close this gap by providing a rigorous classification of Gaussian quantum operations that are covariant under time translations, termed Gaussian covariant operations. We show that several key results known for discrete-variable covariant operations break down in the Gaussian optical setting: discrepancies arise in physical and thermodynamic implementation, in the extensivity of asymmetry, and in catalytic advantages. Our results provide comprehensive mathematical and operational toolkits for Gaussian covariant operations, including a peculiar pair of asymmetry measures that are completely non-extensive. Our findings also reveal surprising consequences of the interplay among symmetry, Gaussianity, and thermodynamic constraints, suggesting that real-world scenarios with multiple constraints have a rich structure not accessible from examining individual constraints separately.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahra Jalali-Mola, Saeid Asgarnezhad-Zorgabad</p>
            <p>Rabi oscillations characterize light-matter hybridization in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics~(WQED) framework, with their associated decay rates reflecting excitation damping, yet their behavior remains unresolved when collective emitters are coupled to a collective waveguide mode. This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED.</p>

            <h2>Photon blockade effect from synergistic optical parametric amplification and driving force in Kerr-medium single-mode cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhang Zhiqiang</p>
            <p>This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay. To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect. Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction. The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum State Continuity Problem and Temporal Enforcement Against Fork Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samet Ünsal</p>
            <p>We introduce the Quantum State Continuity Problem (QSCP), a security objective orthogonal to identity authentication that captures whether a systems current execution is a legitimate continuation of a unique past execution. We show that classical and stateless quantum authentication mechanisms fail to enforce continuity and remain vulnerable to fork attacks. To address this gap, we propose the Quantum State Continuity Witness (QSCW), a minimal quantum-assisted primitive that enforces temporal linkage of execution through stateful quantum evolution and cumulative auditing. Using a GHZ-based toy instantiation and extensive simulation, we demonstrate that temporal enforcement suppresses fork attacks with exponential decay in success probability, while remaining robust to noise and system parameters. Our results highlight execution continuity as a distinct and underexplored dimension of system security.</p>

            <p>The research on open quantum systems is important for both quantum computing and quantum sensing. So far, we can only use the main equation to make an approximate description. The dynamics of a single Fluxonium qubit under Markovian environment satisfied Lindblad Master Equation. In experiments, pulse sequence dynamic decoupling (DD) can enhance the coherence of qubits and effectively suppress noise. Two Fluxonium qubits sensitive to two-level systems (TLS) noise. TLS formed by material defects results in noise with significant non-Markovian characteristics. The dynamics of non-Markovian noise satisfied the post Markov Master Equation (PMME). The TLS noise spectrum is mainly concentrated in low frequencies, so traditional DD cannot effectively suppress TLS noise. The relaxation and dephasing behavior with a complex dynamic characteristics. Based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we put forward a novel DD sequence and design a TLS-tailored dynamical decoupling protocol by optimizing pulse locations to minimize noise power spectral overlap with the Lorentzian shape. Using PMME-consistent framework, we can obtain a stronger low frequency suppression and significantly prolong both Bell-based fidelity and entanglement. We explore specific DD design and precise modeling of entanglement dynamics under non-Markovian TLS noise. Our dynamical decoupling protocol can effectively improve entanglement gates fidelity in NISQ quantum devices.</p>

            <p>While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Single-Step Hybrid CV-DV Transfer of Multipartite W States Using Cat-State Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Nehal Khan, Sumrah Hussain</p>
            <p>We propose a deterministic hybrid continuous-variable-discrete-variable (CV-DV) scheme for the single-step transfer of an $n$-qubit W state encoded in photonic Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger cat-state qubits within a circuit QED architecture. Logical qubits are encoded in even- and odd-parity cat states of bosonic modes, while effective Raman-type interactions between resonator pairs are mediated by a single superconducting flux qutrit operating in the dispersive regime. The protocol coherently transfers the multipartite W state in a single collective operation without populating higher excited atomic levels, thereby strongly suppressing decoherence. Numerical simulations based on the full Lindblad master equation, including realistic cavity dissipation, qutrit relaxation and dephasing, and inter-cavity crosstalk, show that a three-qubit cat-state W state can be transferred with a maximum fidelity of approximately $0.92$. These results demonstrate the feasibility of scalable hybrid CV-DV entanglement transfer using current circuit QED technology.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian and Thermodynamic Signatures in the Classicality Assessment via Kolmogorov Consistency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arghya Maity, Ahana Ghoshal, Kelvin Onggadinata, Teck Seng Koh</p>
            <p>The Kolmogorov consistency condition (KCC) defines the statistical boundary between classical and quantum dynamics. Its violation signifies the breakdown of a classical Markov description of temporal correlations. In this work, we establish a direct analytical connection between KCC violation and non-Markovianity in open quantum dynamics, revealing how memory effects manifest as departures from classical probabilistic consistency. Within a generic two-level open quantum system framework, we establish quantitative connections between the magnitude of KCC violation and key information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, such as mutual information, the Fano factor, heat exchange, and entropy production rate, thereby enabling a thermodynamic interpretation of temporal quantum correlations. Furthermore, we uncover formal correspondences between KCC violation, the Leggett-Garg inequality, and the negativity of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-distribution, identifying them as complementary witnesses of temporal quantum non-classicality. Our results thus provide a unified framework linking information-theoretic, thermodynamic, and temporal indicators of quantumness in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a digital-analog quantum computing framework that enables counterdiabatic protocols to be implemented at constant circuit depth, allowing fast and resource-efficient quantum state preparation on current quantum hardware. Counterdiabatic protocols suppress diabatic excitations in finite-time adiabatic evolution, but their practical application is limited by the non-local structure of the required Hamiltonians and the resource overhead of fully digital implementations. Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors. These results show that digital-analog quantum computing enables a qualitatively new resource scaling for counterdiabatic protocols and related quantum control primitives, with direct implications for quantum simulation, optimization, and algorithmic state preparation on current quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Non-Markovian memory effects in open quantum systems provide valuable resources for preserving coherence and enhancing controllability. However, exploiting them requires strategies adapted to history-dependent dynamics. We introduce a reinforcement-learning framework that autonomously learns to amplify information backflow in a driven two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir. Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration. Consequently, the integrated non-Markovianity achieved by RL substantially exceeds that obtained with OCT. These results demonstrate how long-horizon, model-free learning naturally uncovers distributed-backflow strategies and highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for engineering memory effects in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement serves as a key phenomenon in understanding correlations in many-body systems, but analytical results remain scarce for coupled three-body oscillators. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a geometrical diagonalization approach that constrains Euler angles, thereby reducing the degrees of freedom in the entanglement analysis. It consists of deriving analytical expressions for linear entropy and purity under the bipartitions $(x|yz)$, $(y|xz)$, and $(xy|z)$ using the Wigner function framework. Our results indicate that excitations in any oscillator basically enhance the redistribution of correlations across the system. The mixing angle $\theta$ governs entanglement intensity, ranging from separability to maximal correlation. Moreover, we reveal the symmetry relations, notably $S_{Ly}[(n,m,l),\theta]=S_{Lz}[(n,m,l),-\theta]$ and an intrinsic symmetry within $(x|yz)$. Hence, we clarify how excitation levels and mixing angles create and enhance entanglement in the three coupled harmonic oscillators.</p>

            <p>Quantum steering is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding correlations in multi-body systems. Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to y}(-\theta),\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to x}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to x}(-\theta)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to y}(-\theta)$. Therefore, we elucidate how excitation levels and mixing angles generate and enhance steering in three coupled harmonic oscillators.</p>

            <p>We propose an efficient two-stage protocol for generating distant entanglement in a magnon-mediated hybrid quantum system, where magnons serve dual roles as both interaction mediators and qubits. This integrated design reduces the physical component count while leveraging the inherent advantages of magnons, such as their strong coupling via magnetic dipole interactions, low dissipation, and high integrability. In our setup, a superconducting resonator interfaces between a local superconducting qubit (SQ) and a local magnonic system (QM1), which is waveguide-coupled to a remote magnonic system (QM2). The protocol comprises two stages: (i) deterministic Bell-state generation between the SQ and QM1 using shortcuts to adiabaticity, and (ii) coherent state transfer to QM2 via engineered Hamiltonian dynamics. This adiabatic characteristic enhances robustness against environmental dissipation. Numerical simulations under realistic noise conditions confirm strong resilience to decoherence, achieving fidelity $F > 0.90$ and negativity $\mathcal{N}_2 > 0.40$. These results establish the protocol as a scalable and practical building block for distributed quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Quantum resources can, in principle, enable Heisenberg-limited (HL) sensing, yet no-go theorems imply that HL scaling is generically unattainable in realistic noisy devices. While quantum error correction (QEC) can suppress noise, its use in quantum sensing is constrained by stringent requirements, including prior noise characterization, restrictive signal-noise compatibility conditions, and measurement-based syndrome extraction with global control. Here we introduce an ICO-based QEC protocol, providing the first application of indefinite causal order (ICO) to QEC. By coherently placing auxiliary controls and noisy evolution in an indefinite causal order, the resulting noncommutative interference enables an auxiliary system to herald and correct errors in real time, thereby circumventing the limitations of conventional QEC and restoring HL scaling. We rigorously establish the protocol for single- and multi-noise scenarios and demonstrate its performance in single-qubit, many-body, and continuous-variable platforms. We further identify regimes in which error correction can be implemented entirely by unitary control, without measurements. Our results reveal ICO as a powerful resource for metrological QEC and provide a broadly applicable framework for noise-resilient quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Enables Chemically-Accurate Shallow Neural Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Liu, Wenjie Dou</p>
            <p>The variational optimization of high-dimensional neural network models, such as those used in neural quantum states (NQS), presents a significant challenge in machine intelligence. Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry.</p>

            <p>Based on Ref.\cite{Riccardi A}, we investigate the entropy and variance squeezing of a V-type atom in a dissipative cavity, and discuss the influences of parameters including the spontaneously generated interference (SGI) ($\theta$), the cavity-environment coupling ($\gamma_0/\kappa$) and the atom-cavity detuning ($\Delta$) on the atomic squeezing by using different initial states. The results show that no squeezing of $S_y$ occurs under any condition and that variance squeezing of $S_x$ appears only when $\Delta>0$. Entropy squeezing quantifies quantum fluctuations more precisely than variance squeezing. Moreover, the atomic squeezing of $S_x$ clearly depends on $\theta$, $\gamma_0/\kappa$, $\Delta$ and the initial state. These findings are meaningful for quantum information processing as an ultra-low-noise resource.</p>

            <p>The atomic response to an ultra-intense driving field produces a characteristic high-harmonic spectrum featuring a rapid drop in intensity for the lower harmonics, followed by a plateau and a sharp cutoff. This response vanishes for circularly polarized classical drivers -- a limitation that can be overcome by introducing quantum features into the driving field. In this work, we show that squeezed highly elliptically polarized drivers not only enable the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in classically forbidden regimes of large ellipticity, but also yield highly elliptical harmonic radiation with pronounced super-Poissonian photon statistics. Moreover, we show that the HHG spectral features encode information about the quantum nature of the driving field, revealing the presence of its squeezed field fluctuations. By analyzing the HHG spectral intensity dependence as a function of the driver's ellipticity and squeezing orientation, we identify a means to probe the driving field's quantum properties that intrinsically lie in the high-photon number regime.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation of interacting many-body spin systems is routinely performed with cold trapped ions, and systems with hundreds of spins have been studied in one and two dimensions. In the most common realizations of these platforms, spin degrees of freedom are encoded in low-lying electronic levels, and interactions among the spins are mediated through crystal vibrations. Here we propose a new approach which enables the quantum simulation of two-dimensional spin systems with interaction strengths that are increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions. As a brief illustration of the capabilities of this quantum simulator, we study the entanglement in a frustrated spin system realized by three ions.</p>

            <p>Quantum walk serves as a versatile tool for universal quantum computing and algorithmic research. However, the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) with superconducting circuits is still constrained by some limitations such as operation precision, circuit depth and connectivity. With improved hardware efficiency by using superconducting qutrits (three-level systems), we experimentally demonstrate a scalable DTQW in a superconducting circuit, observing the ballistic spreading of quantum walk in a qutrit chain. The usage of qutrits in our implementation allows hardware efficiently encoding of the walker position and the coin degree of freedom. By exploiting the flexibility and intrinsic symmetries of qutrit-based DTQWs, we successfully prepare two topological phases in the chain. For the first time, particle-hole-symmetry-protected edge states, bounded at the interface between these two topological phases, are observed in the superconducting platform. Measured parameter dependencies further validate the properties of edge states. The scalability and gate-control compatibility of the demonstrated DTQWs enable a versatile tool for superconducting quantum computing and quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Global Parametric Gates for Multi-qubit Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jize Yang, Lin Guo, Haonan Xiong, Jiahui Wang, Yan Li, Yunfan Yang, Chenjie An, Hongyi Zhang, Luyan Sun, Yipu Song, Luming Duan</p>
            <p>We propose and experimentally demonstrate a global parametric gate that generates multi-qubit entangled states in a single step. By applying a parametric drive to a common qubit at precise detunings relative to computational qubits, we directly produce two-, three-, and four-qubit entanglement with state fidelities of 99.4\%\pm0.2\%, 93.4\%\pm0.3\%, and 91.4\%\pm0.3\%, respectively. This scheme enables efficient, reconfigurable control using only microwave drives and is compatible with fixed-frequency qubits. Error analyses indicate that infidelity stems primarily from decoherence and coherent control errors, with negligible contributions from static ZZ coupling and flux noise. Furthermore, simulations with state-of-the-art parameters predict this global gate can generate high-fidelity (99.70\%) entanglement in systems of up to six qubits.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Interaction Between Free Electrons and Light Involving First-order and Second-order Process</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu</p>
            <p>Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect has revealed the quantum interaction between free electrons and optical near filed, which demonstrated plenty of novel phenomena of manipulating free electron wave packet and detecting/shaping quantum photonic states. However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory. Our work uncovers the possible abundant phenomena when free electron interacting with two photons, paves the way for more in-depth studies of nonlinear processes in electron-photon quantum interactions in the future.</p>

            <h2>Flux-noise-resilient transmon qubit via a doubly-connected gradiometric design</h2>

            <p>Frequency-tunable superconducting transmon qubits are a cornerstone of scalable quantum processors, yet their performance is often degraded by sensitivity to low-frequency flux noise. Here we present a doubly-connected gradiometric transmon (the ``8-mon") that incorporates a nano-airbridge to link its two loops. This design preserves full electrical tunability and remains fully compatible with standard X-mon control and readout, requiring no additional measurement overhead. The airbridge interconnect eliminates dielectric loss, which enables the 8-mon to achieve both energy relaxation times $T_{\rm 1}$ comparable to reference X-mons and, in the small flux-bias regime, a nearly threefold enhancement in Ramsey coherence time $T_{\rm 2}^*$. This improved $T_{\rm 2}^*$ reaches the same order as $T_{\rm 1}$ without employing echo decoupling. The device also exhibits superior long-term frequency stability even without any magnetic field shielding. We develop a spatially correlated flux-noise model whose simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental coherence trends, revealing the coexistence of short- and long-correlation-length magnetic noise in the superconducting chip environment. By unifying high tunability with intrinsic flux-noise suppression through a robust geometric design, the 8-mon provides a practical pathway toward more coherent and stable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arisa Ikeda, Akitada Sakurai, Kae Nemoto, Mayu Muramatsu</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</p>

            <h2>Topological Obstructions for Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms: Evidence from MaxCut Instances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prathamesh S. Joshi</p>
            <p>Quantum adiabatic algorithms are commonly analyzed through local spectral properties of an interpolating Hamiltonian, most notably the minimum energy gap. While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Strong Disorder Renormalization Group Method for Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions: Excited States and Finite Temperature Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Kettemann</p>
            <p>We extend the recently introduced strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains, to study excited states, and finite temperature properties. First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, which is defined by the model with power law interaction, keeping only interactions between adjacent spins. We show that the distribution of the absolute value of the couplings is the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. However, the sign of the couplings becomes distributed, and the number of negative couplings increases with temperature $T.$ Next, we derive the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins with power exponent $\alpha$. While the sign of the couplings is found to be distributed, the distribution of the coupling amplitude is given by the strong disorder distribution with finite width $2\alpha,$ with small corrections for $\alpha >2$. Resulting finite temperature properties of both short and power law long ranged spin systems are derived, including the magnetic susceptibility, concurrence and entanglement entropy.</p>

            <h2>Path Integral Solution for Dissipative Generative Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xidi Wang</p>
            <p>Can purely mechanical systems generate intelligent language? We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow. Hamiltonian constraints force the elimination of these dissipative modes and degrading performance despite unchanged model capacity. This establishes language generation as dissipative quantum field theory, proving mechanical systems acquire intelligence through the combination of dissipation and non-locality, not through conservation.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush Raj, Soham Ray, Sai Satyam Samal</p>
            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Heat Transformers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arghya Maity, Paranjoy Chaki, Ahana Ghoshal, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum heat transformer (QHT), a quantum thermodynamic device that modulates temperature gradients between two thermal junctions in quantum systems. Functionally, the QHT is analogous to classical absorption heat transformers in its ability to redistribute thermal energy without external work input. Moreover, we show that its performance ratio mirrors that of classical voltage transformers, where the intrinsic parameters of the system play a role similar to the coil turn ratios. We initially design the device for a three-qubit system, representing the smallest possible self-contained heat transformer model. Subsequently we extend to four-qubit systems, with a specific emphasis on exploring the step-down mode as the primary focus. We showcase the versatility and adaptability of the models by illustrating that a variety of self-contained setups can be constructed, each corresponding to different configurations of the interaction Hamiltonian and their associated self-contained conditions. An important effect in this study is the proof of existence of a necessarily transient step-down quantum heat transformer, that has a dual-mode characteristic, wherein the desired step-down mode can be realized within the transient regime of an originally designed step-up mode of the QHT. We also investigate how to control this transient domain up to which the necessarily transient mode can be achieved, by regulating the initial temperature of the qubits in the four-qubit settings. Therefore, this quantum heat transformer model not only acts as an analog to the classical transformers, but also enjoys advanced characteristics, enabling it to function in both step-up and step-down modes within the same setup, unattainable for classical transformers.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of longitudinal transmon readout to ionization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex A. Chapple, Alexander McDonald, Manuel H. Muñoz-Arias, Alexandre Blais</p>
            <p>Multi-photon processes deteriorate the quantum non-demolition (QND) character of the dispersive readout in circuit QED, causing readout to lag behind single and two-qubit gates, in both speed and fidelity. Alternative methods such as the longitudinal readout have been proposed, however, it is unknown to what extent multi-photon processes hinder this approach. Here we investigate the QND character of the longitudinal readout of the transmon qubit. We show that the deleterious effects that arise due to multi-photon transitions can be heavily suppressed with detuning, owing to the fact that the longitudinal interaction strength is independent of the transmon-resonator detuning. We consider the effect of circuit disorder, the selection rules that act on the transmon, as well as the description of longitudinal readout in the classical limit of the transmon to show qualitatively that longitudinal readout is robust. We show that fast, high-fidelity QND readout of transmon qubits is possible with longitudinal coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex A. Chapple, Othmane Benhayoune-Khadraoui, Simon Richer, Alexandre Blais</p>
            <p>Dispersive readout, the standard method for measuring superconducting qubits, is limited by multiphoton qubit-resonator processes arising even at moderate drive powers. These processes degrade performance, causing dispersive readout to lag behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. In this work, we propose a novel readout method, termed "junction readout". Junction readout leverages the nonperturbative cross-Kerr interaction resulting from coupling a qubit and a resonator via a Josephson junction. Furthermore, by adding a capacitive coupling in parallel to the junction, Purcell decay can be suppressed without the need for a Purcell filter. We also show that junction readout is more robust against deleterious multiphoton processes, and offers greater flexibility for resonator frequency allocation. Crucially, junction readout achieves superior performance compared to dispersive readout while maintaining similar hardware overhead. Numerical simulations show that junction readout can achieve fidelities exceeding $99.99\%$ in under $30$ ns, making it a promising alternative for superconducting qubit readout with current hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matija Tečer, Giuseppe Calajó, Marco Di Liberto</p>
            <p>We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</p>

We demonstrate the quantum analog of this phenomenon in a two-qubit system coupled to a common environment. Tracing out the environment in the quantum collision model, we obtain an effective master equation with a two-body dissipator for two qubits. Quenching the two-body dissipator, we demonstrate controlled transitions from in-phase to anti-phase synchronization. This synchronization transition is robust against noise. Signatures of the transition are observed through Pearson correlation coefficient measurements obtained via quantum simulations on superconducting circuits. Future experiments employing qutrit systems are expected to yield a more pronounced effect.</p>
