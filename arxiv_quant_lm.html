            <h2>Unifying adiabatic state-transfer protocols with $(α, β)$-hypergeometries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Ventura Meinersen, David Fernandez-Fernandez, Gloria Platero, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ</p>
            <p>Adiabatic optimal control schemes are essential for advancing the practical implementation of quantum technologies. However, the vast array of possible adiabatic protocols, combined with their dependence on the particular quantum system and function-specific parameter ranges, complicates the task of discerning their respective strengths and limitations in arbitrary operations. In this work, we provide a unifying framework, called $(\alpha,\beta)$-hypergeometries, that allows for flexible, noise-resistant, and easy-to-use implementation of enforced adiabatic dynamics for any multi-level quantum system. Moreover, this framework provides a comprehensive mapping of all adiabatic protocols through a universal cost function and offers an exact analytical characterization of the adiabatic dynamics. In particular, we derive precise expressions for infidelity resonances and establish performance guarantees in the adiabatic limit for any choice of $(\alpha,\beta)$. We also discuss in detail the experimental feasibility of the resulting pulse shapes through analytical and numerical methods. Finally, we test our method for the optimal control of coherent information transfer through spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots with small valley splittings.</p>

            <h2>Higher order tensor factorizations for block encoding vibrational and vibronic Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirsh Kamakari, Emil Zak</p>
            <p>Fault tolerant quantum simulation via the phase estimation algorithm and qubitization has a T-gate count that scales proportionally to the 1-norm of the Hamiltonian, the cost of block encoding the Hamiltonian, and inversely proportionally to the desired accuracy. Tensor factorization methods have been successfully used to reduce T-gate counts in the ground state electronic structure problem. Here we introduce the use of tensor factorization methods to reduce the T-gate count of quantum phase estimation. In particular, we show how Canonical Polyadic and Tucker decompositions of the tensors representing the vibrational and vibronic Hamiltonians can be utilized to rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of linear combination of bosonic position operators representing nuclear vibrations. We demonstrate the use of these factorization methods on the water and monodeutered methane molecules.</p>

            <h2>Testing bath correlation functions for open quantum dynamics simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaaki Tokieda</p>
            <p>Accurate simulations of thermalization in open quantum systems require a reliable representation of the bath correlation function (BCF). Numerical approaches, such as the hierarchical equations of motion and the pseudomode method, inherently approximate the BCF using a finite set of functions, which can impact simulation accuracy. In this work, we propose a practical and rigorous testing framework to assess the validity of approximate BCFs in open quantum dynamics simulations. Our approach employs a harmonic oscillator system, where the dynamics can be benchmarked against known exact solutions. To enable practical testing, we make two key methodological advancements. First, we develop numerical techniques to evaluate these exact solutions efficiently across a wide range of BCFs for broad applicability. Second, we introduce a moment-based state representation that significantly simplifies computations by exploiting the Gaussian nature of the system. Application to a two-spin system demonstrates that our testing procedure yields reliable error estimates for thermalization simulations. Using this methodology, we assess the performance of recently proposed BCF construction methods, highlighting both their strengths and a notable challenge posed by sub-Ohmic spectral densities at finite temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Efficient measurement of neutral-atom qubits with matched filters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert M. Kent, Linipun Phuttitarn, Chaithanya Naik Mude, Swamit Tannu, Mark Saffman, Gregory Lafyatis, Daniel J. Gauthier</p>
            <p>Quantum computers require high-fidelity measurement of many qubits to achieve a quantum advantage. Traditional approaches suffer from readout crosstalk for a neutral-atom quantum processor with a tightly spaced array. Although classical machine learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can improve fidelity, they are computationally expensive, making it difficult to scale them to large qubit counts. We present two simpler and scalable machine learning algorithms that realize matched filters for the readout problem. One is a local model that focuses on a single qubit, and the other uses information from neighboring qubits in the array to prevent crosstalk among the qubits. We demonstrate error reductions of up to 32% and 43% for the site and array models, respectively, compared to a conventional Gaussian threshold approach. Additionally, our array model uses two orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and four orders of magnitude fewer multiplications and nonlinear function evaluations than a recent convolutional neural network approach, with only a minor (3.5%) increase in error across different readout times. Another strength of our approach is its physical interpretability: the learned filter can be visualized to provide insights into experimental imperfections. We also show that a convolutional neural network model for improved can be pruned to have 70x and 4000x fewer parameters, respectively, while maintaining similar errors. Our work shows that simple machine learning approaches can achieve high-fidelity qubit measurements while remaining scalable to systems with larger qubit counts.</p>

            <h2>CDJ-Pontryagin Optimal Control for General Continuously Monitored Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tathagata Karmakar, Andrew N. Jordan</p>
            <p>The Chantasri-Dressel-Jordan (CDJ) stochastic path integral formalism (Chantasri et al. 2013 and 2015) characterizes the statistics of the readouts and the most likely conditional evolution of a continuously monitored quantum system. In our work, we generalize the CDJ formalism to arbitrary continuously monitored systems by introducing a costate operator. We then prescribe a generalized Pontryagin's maximum principle for quantum systems undergoing arbitrary evolution and find conditions on optimal control protocols. We show that the CDJ formalism's most likely path can be cast as a quantum Pontryagin's maximum principle, where the cost function is the readout probabilities along a quantum trajectory. This insight allows us to derive a general optimal control equations for arbitrary control parameters to achieve a given task. We apply our results to a monitored oscillator in the presence of a parametric quadratic potential and variable quadrature measurements. We find the optimal potential strength and quadrature angle for fixed-end point problems. The optimal parametric potential is analytically shown to have a "bang-bang" form. We apply our protocol to three quantum oscillator examples relevant to Bosonic quantum computing. The first example considers a binomial codeword preparation from an error word, the second looks into cooling to the ground state from an even cat state, and the third investigates a cat state to cat state evolution. We compare the statistics of the fidelities of the final state with respect to the target state for trajectories generated under the optimal control with those generated under a sample control. Compared to the latter case, we see a 40-196% increase in the number of trajectories reaching more than 95% fidelities under the optimal control. Our work provides a systematic prescription for finding quantum optimal control for continuously monitored systems.</p>

            <h2>Downloading many-qubit entanglement from continuous-variable cluster states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihua Han, Hoi-Kwan Lau</p>
            <p>Many-body entanglement is an essential resource for many quantum technologies, but its scalable generation has been challenging on qubit platforms. However, the generation of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement can be extremely efficient, but its utility is rather limited. In this work, we propose a scheme to combine the best of both qubit and CV approaches: a systematic method to download useful many-qubit entanglement from the efficiently generated CV cluster states. Our protocol is based on one-bit teleportation of the qubit correlation encoded in the displaced Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill basis. To characterize the practical performance of our scheme, we develop an equivalent circuit to map dominant CV errors to single-qubit preparation errors. Particularly, we relate finite squeezing error to qubit erasure, and show that only 5.4 dB squeezing is sufficient to implement robust qubit memory or quantum computation (QC), and 11.9 dB for fault-tolerant QC. Our protocol can be implemented with the operations that are common in many bosonic platforms.</p>

            <h2>Scalable universal quantum gates between nitrogen-vacancy centers in levitated nanodiamonds arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyu Zhang, Huaijin Zhang, Zhang-qi Yin</p>
            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamond offer a promising platform for quantum information processing due to their room-temperature spin coherence and optical addressability. However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99\%. This work provides a foundation for reconfigurable quantum hybrid systems, with potential applications in rotational sensing and programmable quantum processing.</p>

            <h2>Rational Extension of Quantum Anisotropic Oscillator Potentials with Linear and/or Quadratic Perturbations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajesh Kumar Yadav, Rajesh Kumar, Avinash Khare</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive study of the rational extension of the quantum anisotropic harmonic oscillator (QAHO) potentials with linear and/or quadratic perturbations. For the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator plus imaginary linear perturbation ($i\lambda x$), we show that the rational extension is possible not only for the even but also for the odd co-dimensions $m$. In two-dimensional case, we construct the rational extensions for QAHO potentials with quadratic ($\lambda \, xy$) perturbation both when $\lambda$ is real or imaginary and obtain their solutions. Finally, we extend the discussion to the three-dimensional QAHO with linear and quadratic perturbations and obtain the corresponding rationally extended potentials. For all these cases, we obtain the conditions under which the spectrum remains real and also when there is degeneracy in the system.</p>

            <h2>Manifestation of critical effects in environmental parameter estimation using a quantum sensor under dynamical control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Cristina Rodriguez, Analia Zwick, Gonzalo A. Alvarez</p>
            <p>Quantum probes offer a powerful platform for exploring environmental dynamics, particularly through their sensitivity to decoherence processes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of critical behavior in the estimation of the environmental memory time $\tau_c$, modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Using dynamically controlled qubit-based sensors -- realized experimentally via solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and supported by numerical simulations -- we implement tailored filter functions to interrogate the environmental noise spectrum and extract $\tau_c$ from its spectral width. Our results reveal a sharp transition in estimation performance between short-memory (SM) and long-memory (LM) regimes, reflected in a non-monotonic estimation error that resembles a phase transition. This behavior is accompanied by an avoided-crossing-like structure in the estimated parameter space, indicative of two competing solutions near the critical point. These features underscore the interplay between control, decoherence, and inference in open quantum systems. Beyond their fundamental significance, these critical phenomena offer a practical diagnostic tool for identifying dynamical regimes and optimizing quantum sensing protocols. By exploiting this criticality, our findings pave the way for adaptive control strategies aimed at enhancing precision in quantum parameter estimation -- particularly in complex or structured environments such as spin networks, diffusive media, and quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Spin-state energetics of heme-related models with the variational quantum eigensolver</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Unathi Skosana, Sthembiso Gumede, Mark Tame</p>
            <p>We present numerical calculations of the energetic separation between different spin states (singlet, triplet and quintet) for a simplified model of a deoxy-myoglobin protein using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The goal is to gain insight into the workflow and challenges of VQE simulations for transition metal complexes, with emphasis on methodology over hardware-specific implementation. The numerical calculations are performed using an in-house statevector simulator with single- and multi-reference trial wavefunctions based on the k-unitary pair coupled-cluster generalized singles and doubles or k-UpCCGSD ansatz. The spin-state energetics for active spaces of increasing size up to 10 spatial orbitals (20 spin orbitals or qubits) are computed with VQE and were found to agree with the classical complete active self-consistent field or CASSCF method to within 1-4 kcal/mol. We evaluate relevant multi-reference diagnostics and show that the spin states computed with VQE possess a sufficient degree of multi-reference character to highlight the presence of strong electron correlation effects. Our numerical simulations show that in the ideal case, the VQE algorithm is capable of reproducing spin-state energetics of strongly correlated systems such as transition metal complexes for both single- and multi-reference trial wavefunctions, asymptotically achieving good agreement with results from classical methods as the number of active orbitals increases.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Atom in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj</p>
            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant cavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the cavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical solution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also predicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be approximately $0.1\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions between the manifolds of the system.</p>

            <h2>Nonclassical states of light induced via measurement in a bimodalsystem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Chakrabarti, S.V. Iyengar, B.V. Jenisha</p>
            <p>We investigate generation of nonclassical photon states via conditional measurement process in a two mode coupled waveguide. Interaction of the fields takes place in a waveguide beamsplitter due to the overlap between normal modes supported therein. A quadratic Hamiltonian of two degrees of freedom describes the hopping interaction. An initial two mode squeezed state undergoes a unitary evolution governed by the interaction Hamiltonian for a specified time. Following this the bipartite state is subjected to a projective measurement that detects $n$-th Fock state in one subsystem. The post-measurement excitation rendered in the residual subsystem depends on the prior time of interaction between the modes as well as the interaction strength. The Wigner quasiprobability distribution of an arbitrary post-selection state is computed. Its nonclassicality is examined via the negativity of the Wigner distribution. The sub-Poissonian nature of the photon statistics is revealed by the Mandel parameter. The dynamically generated squeezing is evidenced in the post-measurement state. In the ultrastrong coupling regime the parity even and odd states display markedly \textit{different} nonclassical properties. The nonclassicality of the post-measurement states obtained here may be \textit{controlled} by varying the interaction strength and the time span of interaction between the modes.</p>

            <h2>Optimization of optomechanical cooling and entanglement using semi-analytic solutions to the Lindblad master equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul R. B. Hughes, Marc M. Dignam</p>
            <p>We solve the Lindblad master equation for the quantum state of a pumped optomechanical system coupled to a thermal bath. We show that when the microwave pump field frequency is on the red sideband of the cavity resonance, the exact form of the state is a beam-split thermal state, and when it is on the blue sideband, it is a two-mode squeezed thermal state. These solutions allow us to determine the mechanical cooling and the entanglement between the microwave and mechanical modes. We find that we can entangle the modes in a thermal environment by activating the two fields sequentially. In this scheme, after cooling the mechanical mode via the red sideband pump, we determine the optimal blue sideband pump field to achieve the maximum entanglement time and the maximum time below a desired correlation variance threshold as a function of the loss rates and equilibrium temperatures of the two modes.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and fragmentation of bosons in an optical lattice inside a cavity using Wannier and position bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Gerard R. Sevilla, Jayson G. Cosme</p>
            <p>The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW) phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities, which may hint at an eventual transition to a Mott insulating (MI) phase.</p>

            <h2>Schottky anomaly in a cavity-coupled double quantum well</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valerii K. Kozin, Dmitry Miserev, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical study of a mesoscopic two-dimensional electron gas confined in a double quantum well that is coupled to a uniform quasi-static cavity mode via fluctuations of the dipole moment. We focus on the regime of large number of electrons participating in the virtual inter-subband transitions. In this regime, the effective photonic potential is no longer quadratic but, instead, it contains large number of minima. Each minimum represents a nearly harmonic oscillator with the renormalized cavity frequency that is much greater than its bare value. The energy offset of a minimum scales quadratically with respect to the photon coordinate corresponding to this minimum. These energy offsets determine the statistical weight of each minimum, and altogether they result in the additive correction to the heat capacity of the system. This correction exhibits a Schottky anomaly and a 0.5k_B plateau at low temperatures. This behavior can be associated with the emergence of a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom does not manifest in the optical conductivity and can only be observed via the heat capacity measurement.</p>

We use this design to systematically map out the transition from superradiant to independent emission from two quantum dots. We perform both lifetime as well as Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurements on the device, observing anti-dips in the photon coincidences indicating collective emission while at the same time observing a drop in lifetime around zero detuning, indicating superradiant behaviour. Performing both measurement types allows us to investigate detuning regions which show both superradiant rate enhancement and inter-emitter coherence, as well as regions in which correlations persist in the absence of rate enhancement.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of Spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg Models and the Haldane Phase with Dysprosium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katharina Brechtelsbauer, Johannes Mögerle, Hans Peter Büchler</p>
            <p>Dysprosium atoms have proven to be a promising platform for quantum simulation due to their strong magnetic moment and high tunability of interactions. In this work, we propose Dysprosium atoms for simulating the one-dimensional spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg model, which is known to have a rich phase diagram including the famous Haldane phase. To realize the model, we make use of the strong dipolar exchange interactions that naturally occur in the ground state of Dysprosium due to its large electron angular momentum of J=8. To implement spin-1 particles, we encode the spin degree of freedom into three Zeeman sublevels, which are energetically isolated by applying a magnetic field. Using the density-matrix renormalization group, we analyze the ground-state properties of the resulting effective model. We find that a chain of fermionic Dysprosium atoms in a suitable magnetic field can form a Haldane state with the characteristic spin-1/2 edge modes. Furthermore, we discuss the use of AC Stark shifts and Raman-type schemes for bosonic Dysprosium to isolate effective spin-1 systems and to increase the tunability of model parameters.</p>

            <h2>QCPINN: Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Afrah Farea, Saiful Khan, Mustafa Serdar Celebi</p>
            <p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws within neural architectures. However, these classical approaches often require a large number of parameters to achieve reasonable accuracy, particularly for complex PDEs. In this paper, we present a quantum-classical physics-informed neural network (QCPINN) that combines quantum and classical components, allowing us to solve PDEs with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining comparable accuracy and convergence to classical PINNs. We systematically evaluated two quantum circuit architectures across various configurations on five benchmark PDEs to identify optimal QCPINN designs. Our results demonstrate that the QCPINN achieves stable convergence and comparable accuracy, while requiring approximately 10% of the trainable parameters used in classical approaches. It also results in a 40% reduction in the relative error L2 for the convection-diffusion equation. These findings demonstrate the potential of parameter efficiency as a measurable quantum advantage in physics-informed machine learning, significantly reducing model complexity while preserving solution quality. This approach presents a promising solution to the computational challenges associated with solving PDEs.</p>

            <h2>Nanoscale Casimir Force Softening Originated from Quantum Surface Responses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hewan Zhang, Kun Ding</p>
            <p>Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</p>

            <h2>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Karamitros, Thomas McKelvey, Apostolos Pilaftsis</p>
            <p>We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</p>

            <p>We consider a 2D atomic array coupled to different photonic environments, focusing on the half-filled excitation subspace, where strong photon interactions can give rise to complex many-body states. In particular, we demonstrate that the least radiant state in this sector is well described by a coherent superposition of all possible quantum dimer coverings: a resonating valence bond (RVB) liquid state. We discuss possible strategies to probe this exotic state, along with their limitations and challenges. Finally, we show that such a quantum dimer covering can also emerge as the ground state of the coherent Hamiltonian describing a 2D atomic array coupled to a photonic band-gap material.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing promises transformative impacts in simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, essential for studying physical systems inaccessible by classical computing. However, existing compilation techniques for Hamiltonian simulation, in particular the commonly used Trotter formulas struggle to provide gate counts feasible on current quantum computers for beyond-classical simulations. We propose partial Trotterization, where sets of non-commuting Hamiltonian terms are directly compiled allowing for less error per Trotter step and therefore a reduction of Trotter steps overall. Furthermore, a suite of novel optimizations are introduced which complement the new partial Trotterization technique, including reinforcement learning for complex unitary decompositions and high level Hamiltonian analysis for unitary reduction. We demonstrate with numerical simulations across spin and fermionic Hamiltonians that compared to state of the art methods such as Qiskit's Rustiq and Qiskit's Paulievolutiongate, our novel compiler presents up to 10x gate and depth count reductions.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</h2>

            <p>Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Multi-Hop Quantum Communication using Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation Protocol</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. Ikken, P. Kumar, A. Slaoui, B. Kar, R. Ahl Laamara, M. Almousa, A. A Abd El-Latif</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a new method for Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation called Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation using the Modified Dijkstra Algorithm and Quantum Walk (BQT-MDQW). This method uses different types of entangled states, such as the GHZ-Bell state, W-Bell state, and Cluster-Bell state, to improve quantum communication in multi-hop quantum wireless networks. We focus on the W-Bell state and compare the quantum Dijkstra algorithm with the classical Dijkstra method to see which one works better. We apply both versions to quantum and classical simulators, measuring their performance through fidelity, memory utilization, and throughput calculations. Our results show that the shortest path problem may be solved with significantly reduced computer complexity using the quantum Dijkstra algorithm based on quantum walks. The introduction of a quantum walk, which permits dynamic transitions between quantum channels and the effective exploration of quantum network states, is an important part of the protocol. Using the capacity of the quantum walk to adjust to changing quantum states, we also introduce a method for successfully identifying unitary matrices under varying quantum channels. The bidirectional teleportation structure of the protocol is designed to solve the multi-hop teleportation problem in quantum wireless networks. In addition, we present quantum Dijkstra's algorithm, which uses quantum gates to significantly decrease computational complexity and solve the networking problem by building on the quantum walk framework. This method shows how quantum computing may be used to solve arbitrary optimization issues such as the shortest path problem. Finally, we present a novel multi-hop quantum teleportation system encompassing both unidirectional and bidirectional communication, as introduced in the quantum Dijkstra algorithm system...</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haimeng Zhao, Yuzhen Zhang, John Preskill</p>
            <p>The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</p>

            <p>Quantum memories for light are essential building blocks for quantum repeaters and quantum networks. Integrated operations of quantum memories could enable scalable application with low-power consumption. However, the photonic quantum storage lifetime in integrated optical waveguide has so far been limited to tens of microseconds, falling short of the requirements for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate quantum storage of photonic qubits for 1.021 ms based on a laser-written optical waveguide fabricated in a 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal. Spin dephasing of 151Eu3+ is mitigated through dynamical decoupling applied via on-chip electric waveguides and we obtain a storage efficiency of 12.0(0.5)% at 1.021 ms, which is a demonstration of integrated quantum memories that outperforms the efficiency of a simple fiber delay line. Such long-lived waveguide-based quantum memory could support applications in quantum repeaters, and further combination with critical magnetic fields could enable potential application as transportable quantum memories.</p>

            <h2>Heralded qudit-based high-dimensional entanglement generation for hybrid photon-emitter system by waveguide-mediated scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fang-Fang Du, Ling-Hui Li</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement systems based on qudits dilate high-dimensional (HD) state spaces and enhance resistance to loss in quantum information processing (QIP). To fully exploit this potential, effective schemes for generating HD entanglement are crucial. In this paper, we propose a flexible heralded scheme generating random 4D two-qudit maximal entanglement for hybrid photon-emitter system by entering different input ports. This approach can be further extended to prepare 4D n-qudit (n is greater than or equal 3) maximal entanglement utilizing the 4D single-qudit Z^m (m=1,2,3) gate for the first qudit and X^m gate for the other qudits (except the second qudit). For the hybrid system, the first 4D qudit is encoded on the hybrid polarization-path states of a flying photon, while the second and subsequent 4D qudits are represented by two stationary emitters coupled to respective 1D waveguide. The qudit-encoded hybrid HD entanglement offers advantages over economizing quantum resource without any auxiliary qudits, and obtaining robust fidelities of various HD entanglement by the error-detected mechanism of the emitter-waveguide systems. Moreover, the proposed protocol can be spread to generate dD n-qudit (d is greater than or equal 2^(p+1), n, p=2,3,...) entangled states, further broadening its applicability in HD QIP.</p>

            <p>To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the Helium (He) molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems.

            <h2>Rydberg Superatom Interface for Topological Microwave-to-Optical Photon Conversion in Fock-State Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Yao Song, Jin-Lei Wu, Weibin Li, Shi-Lei Su</p>
            <p>Microwave-to-optical conversion (MTOC) of single photons plays a pivotal role in bridging quantum devices across different frequency domains, but faces challenges in maintaining efficiency and robustness against fluctuations and dissipation in hybrid quantum systems. Here, we propose a topologically protected MTOC scheme mediated by a Rydberg superatom to address these limitations. By constructing cross-linked Fock-state lattices (FSLs) through a dual-mode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) architecture, we map the effective hybrid system onto an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger~(SSH) model with tunable hopping rates. Photon-number--dependent property of hopping rates triggers a topological phase transition in the extended SSH chain, converting the defect mode into a topological channel that directionally pumps photons between microwave and optical cavities. This mechanism leverages Rydberg blockade-enhanced photon-superatom couplings to establish a robust energy transfer channel, achieving high-efficiency photon conversion under realistic decoherence. Our theoretical framework demonstrates how topological protection synergizes with Rydberg-mediated light-matter interactions to realize a robust quantum transducer, providing a scalable platform for noise-resilient quantum networks and frequency-multiplexed quantum interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Ling Zhang, Yang Liu, Zhi-Kang Lin, Jian-Hua Jiang</p>
            <p>Topological lasers, known for their robustness and unique features originating from nontrivial topology, have recently become a focal point of research in photonics. In this work, we propose a topological laser based on two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattices as induced by artificial gauge flux insertion. The underlying effect, called the topological Wannier cycles, is characterized by topological local modes with continuously tunable frequency and orbital angular momentum emerging in two photonic band gaps. These topological local modes enable single-mode large-area lasing in each photonic band gap with both topological robustness and exceptional tunability in frequency and OAM properties, setting a notable contrast with previous topological lasers. We further discuss both localized and extended artificial gauge flux insertion and compare their properties. We find that extended gauge flux achieves significantly higher laser output intensity and larger single-mode area under laser-gain conditions, outperforming the local gauge flux configuration in both output intensity and resilience against disorders. We also elucidate the precise mechanisms by which nonlinear gain and gauge flux govern the photon dynamics in various regimes. These results provide crucial theoretical insights for OAM control in topological lasers and pave the way for advancements in high precision engineering of lasers and optical systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum transduction is essential for the future hybrid quantum networks, connecting devices across different spectral ranges. In this regard, molecular modulation in hollow-core fibers has proven to be exceptional for efficient and tunable frequency conversion of arbitrary light fields down to the single-photon limit. However, insights on this conversion method for quantum light have remained elusive beyond standard semiclassical models. In this Letter, we employ a quantum Hamiltonian framework to characterize the behavior of entanglement during molecular modulation, while describing the quantum dynamics of both molecules and photons in agreement with recent experiments. In particular, apart from obtaining analytical expressions for the final opto-molecular states, our model predicts a close correlation between the evolution of the average photon numbers and the transfer of entanglement between the interacting parties. These results will contribute to the development of new fiber-based strategies to tackle the challenges associated with the upcoming generation of lightwave quantum technologies.</p>

Logical life-time and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96 % for every cardinal logical state, find logical life-times above the best physical element, and logical error-per-cycle values ranging from from 0.25(2) % to 0.91(3) %.

Our results have broad applications in various directions. We demonstrate applications in quantum machine learning, where our protocol enables efficient training of variational quantum neural networks by directly learning unitary transformations. Additionally, it facilitates the prediction of quantum expectation values with provable efficiency and provides a robust framework for verifying quantum computations and benchmarking realistic noisy quantum hardware.

            <p>We show that a self-correcting GKP qubit can be realized with a high-impedance LC circuit coupled to a resistor and a Josephson junction via a controllable switch. When activating the switch in a particular stepwise pattern, the resonator relaxes into a subspace of GKP states that encode a protected qubit. Under continued operation, the resistor dissipatively error-corrects the qubit against bit flips and decoherence by absorbing noise-induced entropy. We show that this leads to an exponential enhancement of coherence time (T1 and T2), even in the presence of extrinsic noise, imperfect control, and device parameter variations. We show the qubit supports exponentially robust single-qubit Clifford gates, implemented via appropriate control of the switch, and readout/initialization via supercurrent measurement. The qubit's self-correcting properties allows it to operate at ~1K temperatures and resonator Q factors down to ~1000 for realistic parameters, and make it amenable to parallel control through global control signals. We discuss how the effects of quasiparticle poisoning -- potentially, though not necessarily, a limiting factor -- might be mitigated. We finally demonstrate that a related device supports a self-correcting magic T gate.</p>

            <p>Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents.

The microwave cavity acts as a work agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics. Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference.

            <p>We present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of chemical systems on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, incorporating both electronic and nuclear quantum degrees of freedom. An all-particle simulation is nominally efficient on a quantum computer, but practically infeasible. Hence, central to our approach is the construction of a first-quantized plane-wave algorithm making use of pseudoions. The latter consolidate chemically inactive electrons and the nucleus into a single effective dynamical ionic entity, extending the well-established concept of pseudopotentials in quantum chemistry to a two-body interaction. We explicitly describe efficient quantum circuits for initial state preparation across all degrees of freedom, as well as for block-encoding the Hamiltonian describing interacting pseudoions and chemically active electrons, by leveraging recent advances in quantum rejection sampling to optimize the implementations. To extract useful chemical information, we first design molecular fingerprints by combining density-functional calculations with machine learning techniques, and subsequently validate them through surrogate classical molecular dynamics simulations. These fingerprints are then coherently encoded on a quantum computer for efficient molecular identification via amplitude estimation. We provide an extensive analysis of the cost of running the algorithm on a fault-tolerant quantum computer for several chemically interesting systems. As an illustration, simulating the interaction between $\mathrm{NH_3}$ and $\mathrm{BF_3}$ (a 40-particle system) requires 808 logical qubits to encode the problem, and approximately $10^{11}$ Toffoli gates per femtosecond of time evolution.

            <p>Cooling massive oscillators to quantum ground state is a key step for their precise control and quantum application. Recent work found that the center-of-mass motion of a levitated magnetic sphere can be cooled via magnon-cavity coupling. In this work, we demonstrate that a enhanced cooling can be realized by exploiting self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnon mode, observed in a ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere. By means of proper pump driving, the self-Kerr nonlinearity is mapped into degenerate magnon squeezing, leading to considerable enhancement of cooling via optimizing system parameters. Moreover, this Kerr nonlinear effect also brings enhanced cooling in the sideband-unresolved regime where the mechanical frequency is smaller than the cavity decay rate. These results provide new way to quantum technologies in terms of storage schemes and ultrasensitive measurements.</p>

            <p>Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of BEC and superfluidity at surprisingly high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum technologies, enabling advancements in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum precision measurement. Here, we propose a method to enhance optomechanical entanglement by introducing an optical Kerr nonlinear medium and a squeezed vacuum reservoir of the optomechanical cavity. By performing the displacement and squeezing transformations, the system can be reduced to a standard linearized optomechanical system with normalized driving detuning and linearized-coupling strength, in which the optical and mechanical modes are, respectively, coupled to an optical vacuum bath and a mechanical heat bath. We focus on the entanglement generation in the single stable regime of the system. By evaluating the steady-state logarithm negativity, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be enhanced within a wide range of the Kerr constant. In addition, the Kerr nonlinearity can extend the stable region, enabling considerable entanglement generation in the blue sideband-parameter region. We also investigate the dependence of the entanglement generation on the average thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath and the optical driving amplitude. It is found that the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity allows the generation of optomechanical entanglement even when the thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath is as high as 3000. Our findings will provide valuable insights into enhancing fragile quantum resources in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple from the point of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that the process of chemical bond formation is accompanied by a marked increase in the quantum complexity of the electronic ground state. By studying the hydrogen dimer H$_{2}$ as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a pronounced peak that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This measure of quantum complexity, known as magic in the quantum information literature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using classical methods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or breaking are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This insight suggests a connection of quantum information measures to chemical reactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules as a quantum computational resource.</p>

That being said, statistical learning methods are promising approaches to learning the noise and its subsequent mitigation. We devise a graph neural network and regression-based machine learning (ML) architecture for practical realization of EM techniques for molecular Hamiltonian without the requirement of the exponential overhead. Given the short coherence time of the quantum hardware, the ML model is trained with either ideal or mitigated expectation values over a judiciously chosen ensemble of shallow sub-circuits adhering to the native hardware architecture. The hardware connectivity network is mapped to a directed graph which encodes the information of the native gate noise profile to generate the features for the neural network. The training data is generated on-the-fly during ansatz construction thus removing the computational overhead. We demonstrate orders of magnitude improvements in predicted energy over a few strongly correlated molecules.</p>

            <p>The ubiquitous noise in quantum system hinders the advancement of quantum information processing and has driven the emergence of different quantum error correction protocols. Among them, quantum error correction codes tailored for noise-biased qubits exhibit comparatively high error thresholds, making them a promising platform to achieve fault-tolerance. Nevertheless, their quantum operations are challenging and the demonstration of their performance beyond the fault-tolerant threshold remains incomplete. Here, we leverage Schrödinger cat states in scalable planar superconducting circuits to thoroughly characterize the high-fidelity single-qubit quantum operations on noise-biased qubits with systematic quantum tomography and benchmarking tools, demonstrating their state-of-the-art performance beyond the fault-tolerant threshold of the surface code. These results thus embody a transformative milestone in the exploration of quantum systems with structured noises. Notably, our framework is extensible to other structured-noise systems, paving the way for systematic characterization and validation of novel quantum platforms with structured noise.</p>

            <p>Experimental control over the strength and angular dependence of interactions between atoms is a key capability for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we use microwave dressing to manipulate and enhance Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble. By varying the cloud length relative to the blockade radius and measuring the statistics of the light retrieved from the ensemble, we demonstrate a clear enhancement of the interaction strength due to microwave dressing. These results are successfully captured by a theoretical model that accounts for the excitation dynamics, atomic density distribution, and the phase-matched retrieval efficiency. Our approach offers a versatile platform for further engineering interactions by exploiting additional features of the microwave fields, such as polarization and detuning, opening pathways for new quantum control strategies.</p>

            <p>We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG with substantial circumference on cylindrical geometry for the first time in the literature. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.</p>

We show these oscillations are suppressible via synergistic control of coherent driving, cavity parameters, and spin-spin couplings. In addition, we analyze the influence of various system and environmental parameters on the time evolution of ergotropy, revealing rich dynamical features.

            <p>We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET), designed for transporting quantum energy across space-time. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When both supplier and recipient operate within the same time frame, this is called Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET). A proof-of-concept was performed for the Ising model, utilizing quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3% to around 40%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across space-time.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing, sensing, and communication, however it is highly susceptible to decoherence. To address this, quantum optics has explored filtering techniques like photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. Here, we introduce a an entirely new approach to entanglement retrieval exploiting non-Hermitian systems. By employing an anti-parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network using Lanczos transformations, consistent with Wigner-Weisskopf theory. This scheme achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels while remaining robust against decoherence during propagation. Our work offers new insights into using non-Hermitian symmetries to address central challenges in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Assessing Teleportation of Logical Qubits in a Distributed Quantum Architecture under Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Stack, Ming Wang, Frank Mueller</p>
            <p>Quantum computing is facing challenges in terms of scaling to thousands of qubits and implementing quantum error correction (QEC). Scaling efforts focus on connecting multiple smaller quantum devices in a distributed manner while error correction, as a means to overcome noisy physical qubits, is being addressed by developing denser codes with protocols for logical qubits and logical quantum gates. Teleportation of quantum states becomes an important operation as it transfers states from one node to another node within a distributed device. For physical qubits, today's high quantum network noise rates prevent the teleportation of states with useful accuracy. By employing QEC, we show that logical qubits can be teleported between nodes under Surface Code and qLDPC encodings with very low logical error rates, even with network noise in near-term regimes. We use circuit-level simulations to assess physical and network noise regimes ranging from $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}$. This is a wider range than typically studied in circuit level simulations and understanding the behavior of QEC codes in these regimes is necessary for achieving accurate computation.</p>

            <p>Long-distance entanglement is pivotal for quantum communication, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Significant progresses have been made in extending the distribution distance of entangled photons, either in free space or fiber. For future quantum network applications, matter-based entanglement is more favorable since the capability of storage is essential for advanced applications. Extending entanglement distance for memory qubits was partially hindered by the mismatch of its photonic emission wavelength with the low-loss transmission window of optical fiber. By incorporating quantum frequency conversion, memory-memory entanglement has been successfully extended to several tens of kilometers. Here, we make a significant step further by reporting the entanglement between two atomic ensemble quantum memories over 420 km. We convert photons emitted from the memories to telecom S-band, which enable us to exploit the significantly low transmission loss in fiber (0.17 dB/km). We employ the DLCZ scheme for remote entanglement generation, and delicately stabilize the relative phase between the two memories by using fulltime far-off-resonant locking to reduce high-frequency noise and intermittent dual-band locking to compensate low-frequency drift jointly. We demonstrate that the memory-memory entangling probability beats the repeaterless channel capacity for direct entanglement distribution. Our experiment provides a testbed of studying quantum network applications from metropolitan scale to intercity scale.</p>

            <h2>Multilevel Quantum Rabi Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tabitha Doicin, Andrew D. Armour, Tommaso Tufarelli</p>
            <p>The quantum Rabi model, which describes the interaction between a simplified atom and a mode of the electromagnetic field, is a cornerstone of modern quantum optics. One of the key assumptions of the model is that the `atom' is a perfect two-level system. We explore what happens when one generalizes the atom to a multilevel system, with $m$ ground and $n$ excited states coupled to the same field. We focus on the case where the excited and ground states form distinct, well-separated, manifolds of near-degenerate levels (so that the spacing between the excited states on a given manifold is much less than the average spacing between the manifolds) and consider either uniform or random couplings between the individual ground and excited levels. We find that the system reduces approximately to a direct sum of Rabi models with a range of different couplings. Importantly, the strongest coupling is enhanced in a way that depends on the number of levels, for the simple case where $n=m$, the coupling scales with $n$ for uniform couplings and $2\sqrt{n}$ for random couplings (in the limit of large $n$). Our work thus suggests that multilevel Rabi systems could provide an attractive alternative route to accessing regimes of very strong coupling in light-matter systems.</p>

            <p>Molecular nanomagnets are quantum spin systems potentially serving as qudits for future quantum technologies thanks to their many accessible low-energy states. At low temperatures, the primary source of error in these systems is pure dephasing, caused by their interactions with the bath of surrounding nuclear spins degrees of freedom. Most importantly, as the system's dimensionality grows going from qubits to qudits, the control and mitigation of decoherence becomes more challenging. Here we analyze the characteristics of pure dephasing in molecular qudits under spin-echo sequences. We use a realistic description of their interaction with the bath, whose non-Markovian dynamics is accurately computed by the cluster correlation expansion technique. First, we demonstrate a necessary and sufficient condition to prevent the decay of coherence with time, also introducing a parameter to quantify the deviation from such ideal condition. We illustrate this with two paradigmatic systems: a single giant spin and a composite antiferromagnetic spin system. We then advance a proposal for optimized nanomagnets, identifying key ingredients for engineering robust qudits for quantum technologies.</p>

In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics.

            <p>We propose an innovative design for quantum batteries (QBs) that involves coupling two-level systems to a topological photonic waveguide. Employing the resolvent method, we analytically explore the thermodynamic performance of QBs. First, we demonstrate that in the long-time limit, only bound states significantly contribute to the stored energy of QBs. We observe that near-perfect energy transfer can occur in the topologically nontrivial phase. Moreover, the maximum stored energy exhibits singular behavior at the phase boundaries, where the number of bound states undergoes a transition. Second, when a quantum charger and a quantum battery are coupled at the same sublattice within a unit cell, the ergotropy becomes immune to dissipation at that location, facilitated by a dark state and a topologically robust dressed bound state. Third, we show that as dissipation intensifies along with the emergence of the quantum Zeno effect, the charging power of QBs experiences a temporary boost. Our findings offer valuable guidance for improving quantum battery performance in realistic conditions through structured reservoir engineering.</p>

            <p>Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities injected into a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, using two broad Feshbach resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. For attractive impurity-bath interactions, the impurity spectrum features a single branch, which away from the resonance corresponds to a well-defined attractive polaron; near the resonance we observe dramatic broadening of this branch, suggesting a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. For repulsive impurity-bath interactions, the spectrum features two branches: the attractive branch that is dominated by excitations with energy close to that of the Feshbach dimer, but has a many-body character, and the repulsive polaron branch. Our measurements show that the behavior of impurities in weakly interacting baths is remarkably universal, controlled only by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction parameter.</p>

            <p>SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>Quantum multiparameter metrology is hindered by incompatibility issues, such as finding a single probe state (probe incompatibility) and a single measurement (measurement incompatibility) optimal for all parameters. The simultaneous estimation of phase shift and loss in a single optical mode is a paradigmatic multiparameter metrological problem in which such tradeoffs are present. We consider two settings: single-mode or two-mode probes (with a reference lossless mode), and for each setting we consider either Gaussian states or arbitrary quantum states of light restricted only by a maximal number of photons allowed. We find numerically that, as the number of photons increases, there are quantum states of light for which probe incompatibility disappears both in the single- and two-mode scenarios. On the other hand, for Gaussian states, probe incompatibility is present in the single-mode case and may be removed only in the two-mode setting thanks to the entanglement with the reference mode. Finally, we provide strong arguments that the fundamental incompatibility aspect of the model is measurement incompatibility, which persists for all the scenarios considered, and unlike probe-incompatibility cannot be overcome even in the large photon number limit.</p>

The experiment performs a partial measurement on a qubit. It uses the result of that measurement to move an estimated 10e-12 kg of mass in one of two locations separated by approximately 1 mm. In standard quantum mechanics, the partial measurement leaves the system in an improper mixture, a state that appears probabilistic but retains quantum coherence. This is mathematically indistinguishable from a proper mixture, where the state has genuinely collapsed. According to Penrose's theory, improper mixtures can lead to gravitationally induced collapse. Results of our experiment show a change in the circuit evolution that is consistent with wavefunction collapse driven by such an improper mixture. The experiment is performed on an IBM Eagle 127-qubit processor using IBM's programming framework Qiskit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoham Jacoby, Yotam Vaknin, Alex Retzker, Arne L. Grimsmo</p>
            <p>Erasure qubits constitute a promising approach for tackling the daunting resources required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. By heralding erasure errors, both the error-correction threshold and the sub-threshold scaling of the logical error rate are significantly improved. While previous research has focused primarily on fault-tolerant quantum memories, we extend this investigation to magic state injection--a critical yet resource-intensive component of fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that, after postselecting on erasures, the logical error rate of the injected magic state is set by the residual Pauli error, while the space-time overhead is only marginally increased as compared to non-erasure qubits with a similar noise strength. These conclusions hold both for injection into the surface code, and for injection and cultivation on the color code. For the former, we show that most of the gains can be achieved by using just three strategically placed erasure qubits in the surface code patch, independent of the patch size. For the latter, in contrast, it is beneficial to have all the qubits in the cultivation patch be erasure qubits. Our results for cultivation suggest that algorithmically relevant logical error rates may be within reach without magic state distillation for erasure rates $\lesssim 4\times 10^{-3}$ and residual Pauli error rates $\sim 10^{-4}$.</p>

            <p>A central roadblock in the realization of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum hardware is the high overhead associated with measurement repetitions, which hampers the computation of complex problems, such as the simulation of mid- and large-sized molecules. In this work, we propose a novel measurement protocol which relies on computing an approximation of the Hamiltonian expectation value. The method involves measuring cheap grouped operators directly and estimating the residual elements through iterative measurements of new grouped operators in different bases, with the process being truncated at a certain stage. The measured elements comprehend the operators defined by the Hard-Core Bosonic approximation, which encode electron-pair annihilation and creation operators. These can be easily decomposed into three self-commuting groups which can be measured simultaneously. Applied to molecular systems, the method achieves a reduction of 30% to 80% in the number of measurement and gates depth in the measuring circuits compared to state-of-the-art methods. This provides a scalable and cheap measurement protocol, advancing the application of variational approaches for simulating physical systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present the study of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) of zirconium by means of a quantum computation on an emulator representing the features of an architecture based on qubits implemented on carbon nanotubes. ALD process control is key in several technological applications such as spintronics, catalysis and renewable energy storage. We first derive a large ab-initio model of the precursor molecule approaching the infinite hydroxylated silicon (100) surface. In particular, we optimize geometry in three configurations: reactants, transition state and products. Subsequently, we derive an effective small cluster model for each state. Atomic valence active space (AVAS) transformation is then performed on these small clusters, leading to an effective qubit Hamiltonian, which is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We study the convergence of the reaction activation barrier with respect to the active space size and benchmark quantum calculations on a noiseless emulator and on an emulator representing a carbon nanotube qubit architecture, including an appropriate noise model and post-selection error mitigation. These calculations reveal an excellent agreement between the two emulation modes. Our VQE calculations provide the multi-configurational corrections to the single determinant DFT and HF states and pave the way for the routine quantum calculations of ALD reactions.</p>

            <h2>Dynamically near-stable two-mode squeezing in optomechanical system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-fan Qi</p>
            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme within a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, wherein a mechanical resonator is coupled to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the open-quantum-system framework. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unstable system dynamics. Moreover, the squeezing level can surpass the maximum achievable under stable system conditions. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <h2>Hong-Ou-Mandel effect with two frequency-entangled photons of vastly different color</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Mann, Helen M. Chrzanowski, Felipe Gewers, Marlon Placke, Sven Ramelow</p>
            <p>In the original Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment -- when two identical photons are incident upon the input ports of a balanced beam-splitter -- they coalesce, always leaving via the same output port. It is often interpreted that this interference arises due to the indistinguishability of the single photons; the situation, however, is often more nuanced. Here, we demonstrate an analog of HOM interference between two photons of completely different color. To do so, we utilize a quantum frequency converter based on sum- and difference-frequency generation as an `active' beam-splitter -- coupling frequency-entangled red and telecom single photons with an octave-spanning energy difference of 282 THz. This work presents the first demonstration of HOM interference between two single photons of distinctly different color, deepening our understanding of what underlies quantum interference. It also suggests a novel approach to interfacing photonic qubits in heterogeneous quantum systems where frequency conversion and quantum interference are unified.</p>

            <p>We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</p>

By expressing these effective modes, we are able to solve current mysteries in the field, leveraging the formalism and intuition gained in this framework. Furthermore, we show that the mode volumes of these effective modes are independent of the physical area of the Fabry-Pérot cavity mirrors. These results also allow us to explain the recently discovered experimental phenomenon in vibrational polaritons, where chemical reactivities can only be modified if the molecules are coupled in resonance to the normal-incidence mode in a Fabry-Pérot cavity.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the stationary properties of a spin-1/2 impurity immersed in a one-dimensional confined Bose gas. In particular, we consider coherently coupled spin states with an external field, where only one spin component interacts with the bath, enabling light dressing of the impurity and spin-dependent bath-impurity interactions. Through detailed comparisons with ab-initio many-body simulations, we demonstrate that the composite system is accurately described by a simplified effective Hamiltonian. The latter builds upon previously developed effective potential approaches in the absence of light dressing. It can be used to extract the impurity energy, residue, effective mass, and anharmonicity induced by the phononic dressing. Light-dressing is shown to increase the polaron residue, undressing the impurity from phononic excitations because of strong spin coupling. For strong repulsions-previously shown to trigger dynamical Bose polaron decay (a phenomenon called temporal orthogonality catastrophe), it is explained that strong light-dressing stabilizes a repulsive polaron-dressed state. Our results establish the effective Hamiltonian framework as a powerful tool for exploring strongly interacting polaronic systems and corroborating forthcoming experimental realizations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the generation of steady-state entanglement between two atoms resulting from the fluctuation-mediated Casimir-Polder (CP) interactions near a surface. Starting with an initially separable state of the atoms, we analyze the atom-atom entanglement dynamics for atoms placed at distances in the range of $\sim25$ nm away from a planar medium, examining the effect of medium properties and geometrical configuration of the atomic dipoles. We show that perfectly conducting and superconducting surfaces yield an optimal steady-state concurrence value of approximately 0.5. Furthermore, although the generated entanglement decreases with medium losses for a metal surface, we identify an optimal distance from the metal surface that assists in entanglement generation by the surface. While fluctuation-mediated interactions are typically considered detrimental to the coherence of quantum systems at nanoscales, our results demonstrate a mechanism for leveraging such interactions for entanglement generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayakrishnan M. P. Nair, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>Spin squeezing, a form of many-body entanglement, is a crucial resource in quantum metrology and information processing. While experimentally viable protocols for generating stable spin squeezing have been proposed in quantum optics setups, there is growing interest in quantum hybrid solid-state systems as alternative platforms for both engineering and exploring many-body quantum phenomena. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate long-lived spin squeezing in an ensemble of solid-state qubits interacting with electromagnetic noise emitted by a squeezed solid-state bath. We identify the conditions under which quantum correlations within the bath can be transferred to the qubit array, driving it into an entangled state independently of its initial configuration. To assess the experimental feasibility of our approach, we analyze the dynamics of an array of solid-state spin defects coupled to a common ferromagnetic bath, which is driven into a non-equilibrium squeezed state through its interaction with a surface acoustic wave mode. Our results demonstrate that the ensemble can exhibit steady-state spin squeezing under suitable conditions, opening new pathways for the generation of robust many-body entanglement in solid-state spin ensembles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan</p>
            <p>Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p>The correlations of certain entangled states can be perfectly simulated classically via a local model. Hence such states are termed Bell local, as they cannot lead to Bell inequality violation. Here, we show that Bell nonlocality can nevertheless be activated for certain Bell-local states via a catalytic process. Specifically, we present a protocol where a Bell-local state, combined with a catalyst, is transformed into a Bell-nonlocal state while the catalyst is returned exactly in its initial state. Importantly, this transformation is deterministic and based only on local operations. Moreover, this procedure is possible even when the state of the catalyst is itself Bell local, demonstrating a new form of superactivation of Bell nonlocality, as well as an interesting form of quantum catalysis. On the technical level, our main tool is a formal connection between catalytic activation and many-copy activation, which is of independent interest.</p>

The interplay between the unbalanced hopping amplitudes and the waveguide setup results in Non-Hermitian Bloch oscillations, where energy transport is either amplified or dissipated at specific locations, depending on the relative strengths of the left and right hopping terms. We demonstrate that by applying an appropriate non-unitary transformation, the original system can be mapped into an equivalent reciprocalwaveguide with Hermitian dynamics.

            <p>We propose a series of dissipation-assisted entanglement generation protocols that can be implemented on a trapped-ion quantum simulator. Our approach builds on the single-site molecular electron transfer (ET) model recently realized in the experiment [So et al. Sci. Adv. 10, eads8011 (2024)]. This model leverages spin-dependent boson displacement and dissipation controlled by sympathetic cooling. We show that, when coupled to external degrees of freedom, the ET model can be used as a dissipative quantum control mechanism, enabling the precise tailoring of both spin and phonon steady state of a target sub-system. We derive simplified analytical formalisms that offer intuitive insights into the dissipative dynamics. Using realistic interactions in a trapped-ion system, we develop a protocol for generating $N$-qubit and $N$-boson $W$ states. Additionally, we generalize this protocol to realize generic $N$-qubit Dicke states with tunable excitation numbers. Finally, we outline a realistic experimental setup to implement our schemes in the presence of noise sources.</p>

We uncover the emergence of Floquet scarring states, a class of quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) states that defy random thermalization. The underlying physical mechanism is identified to be the Floquet resonances between these degenerate Fock bases that can be connected by one hopping process. It is the first-order hopping perturbation effect. Utilizing the degenerate Floquet perturbation theory, we derive the exact conditions under which the exotic QMBS states emerge. Phenomena such as quantum revivals and subharmonic responses are also studied.

            <h2>Numerical Framework for Multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings Models Incorporating the Modified Langevin Noise Formalism: Non-Markovian Analysis of Atom-Field Interactions in Dissipative Electromagnetic Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunwoo Choi, Weng Cho Chew, Dong-Yeop Na</p>
            <p>We present a novel numerical framework that integrates the modified Langevin noise formalism into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models, enabling a first-principles, non-Markovian analysis of atom-field interactions in dissipative electromagnetic (EM) environments that account for both radiative losses and absorptive dissipation in lossy dielectric media (or satisfying general inhomogeneous causal media exhibiting both dispersion and absorption effects). In the modified Langevin noise formalism, the boundary- and medium-assisted (BA and MA) fields, which constitute a continuum set of EM modes in dissipative EM environments, are numerically obtained using the finite-element method (FEM). Specifically, BA field modes are extracted by solving plane-wave scattering problems, while MA field modes are determined through point-source radiation problems. These numerically obtained BA and MA field modes are then incorporated into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models such that the coupling strength between atoms and BA-MA field modes can be calculated for the study of atom-field interactions in dissipative EM environments. The proposed methodology captures non-Markovian atomic dynamics that cannot be described by traditional quantum master equations under the Markovian approximation. To validate the accuracy of the proposed numerical framework, we present four numerical examples: (i) a two-level system (TLS) in a perfect electric conductor (PEC) half-space; (ii) dissipative cavity electrodynamics with two limiting cases approaching spontaneous emission in free space and ideal Rabi oscillations; (iii) super-radiance in TLS arrays; and (iv) entanglement sudden death of two TLSs inside dissipative cavities. The proposed methodology can serve as a ground-truth numerical simulator for studying atom-field interactions in general dissipative EM environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum networking technologies use spin qubits and their interface to single photons as core components of a network node. This necessitates the ability to co-design the magnetic- and optical-dipole response of a quantum system. These properties are notoriously difficult to design in many solid-state systems, where spin-orbit coupling and the crystalline environment for each qubit create inhomogeneity of electronic g-factors and optically active states. Here, we show that GaAs quantum dots (QDs) obtained via the quasi-strain-free local droplet etching epitaxy growth method provide spin and optical properties predictable from assuming the highest possible QD symmetry. Our measurements of electron and hole g-tensors and of transition dipole moment orientations for charged excitons agree with our predictions from a multiband k.p simulation constrained only by a single atomic-force-microscopy reconstruction of QD morphology. This agreement is verified across multiple wavelength-specific growth runs at different facilities within the range of 730 nm to 790 nm for the exciton emission. Remarkably, our measurements and simulations track the in-plane electron g-factors through a zero-crossing from -0.1 to 0.3 and linear optical dipole moment orientations fully determined by an external magnetic field. The robustness of our results demonstrates the capability to design - prior to growth - the properties of a spin qubit and its tunable optical interface best adapted to a target magnetic and photonic environment with direct application for high-quality spin-photon entanglement.</p>

Although studied in various systems both in theory and experiment, the redirection of single photons with many output ports, compatible with large-scale photonic circuits, still needs to be explored.

The Rydberg component of the stored photon is changed using a stimulated Raman transition with a specific intermediate state. By adjusting the direction of the retrieval laser, we can redirect the emitted photon into a rich variety of alternative modes. Building upon this scheme, we propose a quantum routing of single photons with \textit{N} output channels and unity routing efficiency. In addition, the protocol reduces the effect of motional dephasing increasing the photon lifetime to $>10~\mu$s ($>20$ times photon processing time), enabling functional quantum devices based on Rydberg polaritons.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast all-optical Floquet engineering. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%.

            <p>The confluence of Non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding edge dislocations in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. These NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states as the system arrives at the shore of fostering exceptional points in the Brillouin zone under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</p>

            <p>In the framework of the hybrid quantum-classical variational cluster approach (VCA) to strongly correlated electron systems one of the goals of a quantum subroutine is to find single-particle correlation functions of lattice fermions in polynomial time. Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our new algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.</p>

            <p>Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori</p>
            <p>It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe</p>
            <p>We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</p>

            <h2>Multiparticle quantum plasmonics: fundamentals and applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyuan Hong</p>
            <p>Quantum plasmonics explores how light interacts with collective charge oscillations at metal-dielectric interfaces, enabling strong confinement and enhanced quantum effects at the nanoscale. While traditional quantum optics focuses on single photons, this thesis explores an intermediate regime - multiparticle quantum optics - where classical light, analyzed using photon-number-resolving detection and projective measurements, reveals nontrivial quantum correlations. We begin by establishing the theoretical foundation of multiparticle quantum plasmonics, introducing key concepts like photon-plasmon interactions, coherence, and statistical fluctuations. The first study shows that multiparticle scattering can alter quantum statistics in plasmonic systems, offering new control over fluctuations. The second reveals nonclassical near-field plasmon dynamics, showing how quantum coherence emerges from bosonic and fermionic contributions in subsystems. The third study presents a quantum plasmonic sensing method, using conditional detection to boost signal-to-noise ratio and improve phase estimation. The final study extends this approach to quantum imaging with natural light: by isolating multiphoton correlations from thermal light via photon-number-resolving detection and a single-pixel protocol, we enhance image contrast under noisy conditions. These results show that multiparticle interactions can control quantum statistical properties, even in classical fields. By bridging theory and application, this thesis advances quantum plasmonics and highlights the potential of multiphoton methods in imaging, sensing, and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Dynamics from Flows of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Hahn, David M. Long, Marin Bukov, Anushya Chandran</p>
            <p>Analytical treatments of far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics are few, even in well-thermalizing systems. The celebrated eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a post hoc ansatz for the matrix elements of observables in the eigenbasis of a thermalizing Hamiltonian, given various response functions of those observables as input. However, the ETH cannot predict these response functions. We introduce a procedure, dubbed the statistical Jacobi approximation (SJA), to update the ETH ansatz after a perturbation to the Hamiltonian and predict perturbed response functions. The Jacobi algorithm diagonalizes the perturbation through a sequence of two-level rotations. The SJA implements these rotations statistically assuming the ETH throughout the diagonalization procedure, and generates integrodifferential flow equations for various form factors in the ETH ansatz. We approximately solve these flow equations for certain classes of observables, and predict both quench dynamics and autocorrelators in the thermal state of the perturbed Hamiltonian. The predicted dynamics compare well to exact numerics in both random matrix models and one-dimensional spin chains.</p>

            <h2>Double-bracket algorithm for quantum signal processing without post-selection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yudai Suzuki, Bi Hong Tiang, Jeongrak Son, Nelly H. Y. Ng, Zoë Holmes, Marek Gluza</p>
            <p>Quantum signal processing (QSP), a framework for implementing matrix-valued polynomials, is a fundamental primitive in various quantum algorithms. Despite its versatility, a potentially underappreciated challenge is that all systematic protocols for implementing QSP rely on post-selection. This can impose prohibitive costs for tasks when amplitude amplification cannot sufficiently improve the success probability. For example, in the context of ground-state preparation, this occurs when using a too poor initial state. In this work, we introduce a new formula for implementing QSP transformations of Hermitian matrices, which requires neither auxiliary qubits nor post-selection. Rather, using approximation to the exact unitary synthesis, we leverage the theory of the double-bracket quantum algorithms to provide a new quantum algorithm for QSP, termed Double-Bracket QSP (DB-QSP). The algorithm requires the energy and energetic variance of the state to be measured at each step and has a recursive structure, which leads to circuit depths that can grow super exponentially with the degree of the polynomial. With these strengths and caveats in mind, DB-QSP should be viewed as complementing the established QSP toolkit. In particular, DB-QSP can deterministically implement low-degree polynomials to "warm start" QSP methods involving post-selection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Rodriguez-Blanco, Ho Nam Nguyen, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>Practical quantum computation heavily relies on the ability to perform quantum error correction in a fault-tolerant manner. Fault-tolerant encoding is a critical first step, and careful consideration of the error correction cycle that follows is essential for ensuring the encoding's effectiveness and compatibility. In this work, we investigate various correction-ready encoding methods to fault-tolerantly prepare the zero-logical state of the [[7,1,3]] Steane code on a 2D grid. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that parity-check encoding with a few Flag-Bridge qubits outperforms verification-based encoding by achieving lower error rates and allowing flexible tuning of the performance-efficiency trade-off. Additionally, parity-check approach enables a compact hybrid protocol that combines encoding and error correction, capable of matching the performance of a standalone error correction protocol with perfect encoding. Surprisingly, compared to the resource-intensive Steane error correction, this low-overhead method still offers a practical advantage in noisy settings. These findings highlight the approach with Flag-Bridge qubits as a robust and adaptable solution for noisy near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Resetting Protocols Based on Synchronizing Words</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jędrzej Stempin, Jan Wójcik, Andrzej Grudka, Marcin Karczewski, Paweł Kurzyński, Antoni Wójcik</p>
            <p>Resetting a system's state plays a fundamental role in physics, engineering, computer science, and many other fields. Here we focus on a method originally proposed in automata theory. The state of an automaton evolves according to a set of rules. These rules form an alphabet, and one can apply these rules one after another. Such a sequence of rules is known as a word. Some particular words, known as synchronizing words, enable a system to evolve into a predetermined state regardless of its initial configuration. This process, which is inherently irreversible, appears at first glance to be incompatible with the unitarity of quantum mechanics. Unitary evolution preserves information, hence forbids such classical resetting to a predetermined state. In this work, we introduce a novel resetting protocol based on quantum-synchronizing words by incorporating auxiliary qubits whose states encode rules of the automaton's alphabet. We further propose a quantum circuit that realizes this protocol and can be implemented on a quantum computer. Additionally, we establish a connection between this approach and Kraus channels, showing that quantum synchronizing words can be achieved without explicit reference to the states of ancillary qubits. Our results bridge classical and quantum notions of synchronizing words, shedding light on the interplay between quantum information processing and non-unitary dynamics.</p>

            <p>Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.</p>

            <p>This work investigates the impact of time rescaling on the performance of Feedback Quantum Algorithms (FQA) and their variant for optimization tasks, FALQON. We introduce TR-FQA and TR-FALQON, time-rescaled versions of FQA and FALQON, respectively. The method is applied to two representative problems: the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem and ground-state preparation in the ANNNI quantum many-body model. The results show that TR-FALQON accelerates convergence to the optimal solution in the early layers of the circuit, significantly outperforming its standard counterpart in shallow-depth regimes. In the context of state preparation, TR-FQA demonstrates superior convergence, reducing the required circuit depth by several hundred layers. These findings highlight the potential of time rescaling as a strategy to enhance algorithmic performance on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum light sources with configurable photon lifetimes are essential for large-scale quantum circuits, enabling applications in programmable quantum computing, various quantum key distribution protocols, and quantum tomography techniques. However, the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and photon lifetime imposes significant challenges on the design of high-performance large configurable lifetime quantum light sources. Here, we report on such chip-scale quantum light sources by harnessing the unique feature of parity-time (PT) symmetry. The core design centers on employing PT-symmetric coupling between two microresonators of distinct circumferences, enabling broad-range and selective tuning of intracavity photon density of states. By controlling the alignment between resonators, we achieved a 38-fold photon lifetime tuning range (4 ~ 158 ps), with the shortest lifetimes near the exceptional points of the PT-symmetric systems. The device generates energy-time entangled photon pairs with 87.1 +- 1.1% interference visibility and a heralded second-order autocorrelation of g_h^((2) ) (0)= 0.069 +- 0.001. Our work highlights the potential of PT symmetry for advanced quantum applications, including high-speed communication and programmable quantum computing, quantum coherent tomography, and beyond.</p>

While the applicability of QKD can be readily increased with the use of intermediary trusted nodes, this adds additional privacy requirements on third parties.

Additionally, we identify multipartite symmetric states whose entanglement outperforms that of previously known candidates for maximally entangled symmetric states.

            <p>Quantum timeless approaches solve the problem of time by recovering the usual unitary evolution of quantum theory relative to a clock in a stationary quantum Universe. For some Hamiltonians of the Universe, such as those including an interaction term with the clock, the dynamics is substantially altered and can be non-unitary. This work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the relative dynamics to be unitary and finds the general form of the unitary evolution operator. A physical interpretation of these conditions is given in terms of the clock's rate. Unitary dynamics is associated with rates that are constant in time and independent of the clock's internal structure.</p>

            <p>We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while reaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013116 (2021).</p>

It is highly flexible, allowing for the in situ characterization of FLO-averaged gate-dependent noise under natural assumptions on a family of continuously parameterized one- and two-qubit gates. We rigorously show that our protocol has an efficient sampling complexity, owing in-part to useful properties of the Kravchuk transformations that feature in our analysis. We support our conclusions with numerical results. As FLO circuits become universal with access to certain resource states, we expect our results to inform noise characterization and error mitigation techniques on universal quantum computing architectures which naturally admit a fermionic description.</p>

            <p>It is often claimed that adding a qubit to a black hole requires energy $\Delta E \geq T_H \log 2$ so that the extra Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can accommodate the qubit. In this essay, we explain how the recently discovered phenomenon of black hole decoherence allows quantum information to be teleported into a black hole, with arbitrarily small energy cost. The generalized second law is not violated and there is no conflict with unitarity because the teleportation creates new entanglement, analogous to Hawking radiation, between the black hole interior and exterior. In accordance with Landauer's principle, a nonzero minimum energy cost only appears when there is a net erasure of information and noise from the exterior or, equivalently, when ``zerobits'' are sent into the black hole.</p>

            <p>Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes with asymptotically non-zero rates are prominent candidates for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation, primarily due to their syndrome-measurement circuit's low operational depth. Numerous studies advocate for the necessity of fast decoders to fully harness the capabilities of QLDPC codes, thus driving the focus towards designing low-complexity iterative decoders. However, empirical investigations indicate that such iterative decoders are susceptible to having a high error floor while decoding QLDPC codes. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the decoding failures of the \emph{hypergraph-product} and \emph{lifted-product} codes and to design decoders that mitigate these failures, thus achieving a reduced error floor. The suboptimal performance of these codes can predominantly be ascribed to two structural phenomena: (1) stabilizer-induced trapping sets, which are subgraphs formed by stabilizers, and (2) classical trapping sets, which originate from the classical codes utilized in the construction of hypergraph-product and lifted-product codes. The dynamics of stabilizer-induced trapping sets is examined and a straightforward modification of iterative decoders is proposed to circumvent these trapping sets. Moreover, this work proposes a systematic methodology for designing decoders that can circumvent classical trapping sets in both hypergraph product and lifted product codes, from decoders capable of avoiding their trapping set in the parent classical LDPC code. When decoders that can avoid stabilizer-induced trapping sets are run in parallel with those that can mitigate the effect of classical TS, the logical error rate improves significantly in the error-floor region.</p>

            <p>A critical problem in the financial world deals with the management of risk, from regulatory risk to portfolio risk. Many such problems involve the analysis of securities modelled by complex dynamics that cannot be captured analytically, and hence rely on numerical techniques that simulate the stochastic nature of the underlying variables. These techniques may be computationally difficult or demanding. Hence, improving these methods offers a variety of opportunities for quantum algorithms. In this work, we study the problem of Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) which has significant importance in the valuation of derivative portfolios. As a variant, we also consider the problem of pricing a portfolio of many different financial options. We propose quantum algorithms that accelerate statistical sampling processes to approximate the price of the multi-option portfolio and the CVA under different measures of dispersion. Technically, our algorithms are based on enhancing the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms by Montanaro with an unbiased version of quantum amplitude estimation. We analyse the conditions under which we may employ these techniques and demonstrate the application of QMC techniques on CVA approximation when particular bounds for the variance of CVA are known.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Setiawan, Alexander V. Gramolin, Elisha S. Matekole, Hari Krovi, Jacob M. Taylor</p>
            <p>Accurate modeling of noise in realistic quantum processors is critical for constructing fault-tolerant quantum computers. While a full simulation of actual noisy quantum circuits provides information about correlated noise among all qubits and is therefore accurate, it is, however, computationally expensive as it requires resources that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. We propose an efficient systematic construction of approximate noise channels, where their accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating noise components with higher qubit-qubit correlation degree. To formulate such approximate channels, we first present a method, dubbed the cluster expansion approach, to decompose the Lindbladian generator of an actual noise channel into components based on interqubit correlation degree. We generate a $k$-th order approximate noise channel by truncating the cluster expansion and incorporating noise components with correlations up to the $k$-th degree. We require that the approximate noise channels must be accurate and also ``honest", i.e., the actual errors are not underestimated in our physical models. As an example application, we apply our method to model noise in a three-qubit quantum processor that stabilizes a [[2,0,2]] codeword, which is one of the four Bell states. We find that, for realistic noise strength typical for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits coupled via always-on static interactions, correlated noise beyond two-qubit correlation can significantly affect the code simulation accuracy. Since our approach provides a systematic characterization of multi-qubit noise correlations, it enables the potential for accurate, honest and scalable approximations to simulate large numbers of qubits from full modeling or experimental characterizations of small enough quantum subsystems, which are efficient but still retain essential noise features of the entire device.</p>

This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</p>

We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics.

We propose a schematic design of an interferometric set-up to experimentally capture this effect by utilizing the phase difference between an accelerated and an inertial atoms. For the choice of hydrogen atoms and suitable separation between atoms and mirrors, the required acceleration can be very low.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangbei Li, Yaoming Chu, Shaoliang Zhang, Jianming Cai</p>
            <p>The comprehension of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) is considered as a critical foothold in the field of many-body physics. Developing protocols to effectively identify and understand QPTs thus represents a key but challenging task for present quantum simulation experiments. Here, we establish a dynamical quench-interferometric framework to probe a zero-temperature QPT, which utilizes the evolved state by quenching the QPT Hamiltonian as input of a unitary interferometer. The metrological capability quantified by the quantum Fisher information captivatingly shows an unique peak in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, allowing us to probe the QPT without cooling the system to its ground state. We show that the probing can be implemented by extracting quantum fluctuations of the interferometric generator as well as parameter estimation uncertainty of the interferometric phase, and subsequently allows identifying the boundary of the phase diagram. Our results establish an important link between QPTs and quantum metrology, and enrich the toolbox of studying non-equilibrium many-body physics in current quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a supercondicting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting a finite-component phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin</p>
            <p>Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.</p>

            <h2>An Operational Quantum Field Theoretic Model for Gravitationally Induced Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jackson Yant, Miles Blencowe</p>
            <p>We develop a quantum field-theoretic model of gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two massive objects in spatial superposition. The masses are described as excitations of a scalar field in an external harmonic potential, allowing for a well-defined notion of relativistic coherent states. Using linearized quantum gravity in the static limit, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that induces entanglement between the field modes occupied by the masses. To probe this entanglement, we construct an observable from field operators that corresponds to the probability density of detecting the center of mass of one of these massive objects. Using this, we compute the fringe visibility in the overlap region and find that gravitationally induced entanglement leads to a decrease in visibility, consistent with previous nonrelativistic results. Additionally, we identify relativistic corrections that accelerate the decay of fringe visibility. These results provide a framework for studying weakly relativistic quantum field systems and their gravitational interactions in tabletop experiments.</p>

We apply them to quantum impurity systems consisting of several sites and the single impurity Anderson model to study the relationship between their states and the behaviors of quantum informative quantities. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</p>

What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Marmorini, Takeshi Fukuhara, Daisuke Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable independent measurements. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the ``spin-spiral'' structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, under various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.</p>

We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate.

            <h2>Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cai Zhang</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.</p>

This protocol imposes stringent requirements on storage efficiency and noise level to reach a secure regime.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brij Mohan, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Manabendra Nath Bera</p>
            <p>Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Relieving the post-selection problem by quantum singular value transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Yi Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum measurement is a fundamental yet experimentally challenging ingredient of quantum information processing. Many recent studies on quantum dynamics focus on expectation values of nonlinear observables; however, their experimental measurement is hindered by the post-selection problem -- namely, the substantial overhead caused by uncontrollable measurement outcomes. In this work, we propose a post-selection--free experimental strategy based on a fully quantum approach. The key idea is to deterministically simulate the post-selected quantum states by applying quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) algorithms. For pure initial state post-selection, our method is a generalization of fixed-point amplitude amplification to arbitrary projective measurements, achieving an optimal quadratic speedup. We further extend this framework to mixed initial state post-selection by applying linear amplitude amplification via QSVT, which significantly enhances the measurement success probability. However, a deterministic quantum algorithm for preparing the post-selected mixed state is generally impossible because of information-theoretic constraints imposed by quantum coding theory. Additionally, we introduce a pseudoinverse decoder for measurement-induced quantum teleportation. This decoder possesses the novel property that, when conditioned on a successful flag measurement, the decoding is nearly perfect even in cases where channel decoders are information-theoretically impossible. Overall, our work establishes a powerful approach for measuring novel quantum dynamical phenomena and presents quantum algorithms as a new perspective for understanding quantum dynamics and quantum chaos.</p>

            <h2>Digital Quantum Simulation of the Nonlinear Lindblad Master Equation Based on Quantum Trajectory Averaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Guo Liu, Heng Fan, Shu Chen</p>
            <p>Since precisely controlling dissipation in realistic environments is challenging, digital simulation of the Lindblad master equation (LME) is of great significance for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems. However, achieving long-time simulations for complex systems with multiple dissipation channels remains a major challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose a 2-dilation digital simulation scheme for the non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) based on quantum trajectory averaging. The NLME continuously interpolates between full LME and the dynamical equation governed by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Remarkably, for standard LMEs, our scheme reduces to a 1-dilation method that enables deterministic realizations without postselection. This deterministic nature overcomes a key limitation in some existing simulation methods, where repeated postselections lead to exponentially vanishing implementation probabilities. Consequently, our scheme allows efficient long-time simulations of LMEs with multiple jump operators. As a demonstration, we present numerical experiments simulating novel theoretical predictions in open quantum systems, including localization in open quantum systems and the postselected skin effect.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate prepare-and-measure scenarios in which a sender and a receiver use entanglement to send quantum information over a channel with limited capacity. We formalise this framework, identify its basic properties and provide numerical tools for optimising quantum protocols for generic communication tasks. The seminal protocol for sending quantum information over a classical channel is teleportation. We study a natural stochastic generalisation in which the sender holds $N$ qubits from which the receiver can recover one on demand. We show that with two bits of communication alone, this task can be solved exactly for all $N$, if the sender and receiver have access to stronger-than-quantum nonlocality. We then consider entanglement-based protocols and show that these can be constructed systematically by leveraging connections to several well-known quantum information primitives, such as teleportation, cloning machines and random access coding. In particular, we show that by using genuine multi-particle entangled measurements, one can construct a universal stochastic teleportation machine, i.e.~a device whose teleportation fidelity is independent of the quantum input.</p>

            <p>Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor.</p>

            <p>We study the collective charging of a quantum battery (QB) consisting of a one-dimensional molecular aggregate and a coupled single-mode cavity, to which we refer as an ``organic quantum battery" since the battery part is an organic material. The organic QB can be viewed as an extension of the so-called Dicke QB [D. Ferraro \emph{et al}., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 117702 (2018)] by including finite exciton hopping and exciton-exciton interaction within the battery. We consider two types of normalizations of the exciton-cavity coupling when the size of the aggregate $N$ is increased: (I) The cavity length also increases to keep the density of monomers constant, (II) The cavity length does not change. Our main findings are that: (i) For fixed $N$ and exciton-cavity coupling, there exist optimal exciton-exciton interactions at which the maximum stored energy density and the maximum charging power density reach their respective maxima that both increase with increasing exciton-cavity coupling. The existence of such maxima for weak exciton-cavity coupling is argued to be due to the non-monotonic behavior of the one-exciton to two-exciton transition probability in the framework of second-order time-dependent perturbation theory. (ii) Under normalization I, no quantum advantage is observed in the scaling of the two quantities with varying $N$. Under normalization II, it is found that both the maximum stored energy density and the maximum charging power density exhibit quantum advantages compared with the Dicke QB.</p>

            <p>The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</p>

            <p>The precise synchronization of distant clocks is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a novel approach of quantum clock synchronization utilizing entangled and correlated photon pairs generated by a quantum dot at telecom wavelength. By distributing these entangled photons through a metropolitan fiber network in the Stockholm area and measuring the remote correlations, we achieve a synchronization accuracy of tens of picoseconds by leveraging the tight time correlation between the entangled photons. We show that our synchronization scheme is secure against spoofing attacks by performing a remote quantum state tomography to verify the origin of the entangled photons. We measured a distributed maximum entanglement fidelity of $0.817 \pm 0.040$ to the $|\Phi^+\rangle$ Bell state and a concurrence of $0.660 \pm 0.086$. These results highlight the potential of quantum dot-generated entangled pairs as a shared resource for secure time synchronization and quantum key distribution in real-world quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Repeater-Based Quantum Communication Protocol: Maximizing Teleportation Fidelity with Minimal Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arkaprabha Ghosal, Jatin Ghai, Tanmay Saha, Sibasish Ghosh, Mir Alimuddin</p>
            <p>Transmitting unknown quantum states to distant locations is crucial for distributed quantum information protocols. The seminal quantum teleportation scheme achieves this feat while requiring prior maximal entanglement between the sender and receiver. In scenarios with noisy entangled states, optimal teleportation fidelity characterizes the efficacy of transmitting the state, demanding the proper selection of local operations at the sender's and receiver's ends. The complexity escalates further in long-range communication setups, prompting the consideration of a repeater-based approach, which incorporates arrays of nodes with multiple segments to facilitate the efficient transmission of quantum information. The fidelity of the communication line gets degraded even if a single segment is affected by noise. In such cases, the general wisdom employs the standard entanglement swapping protocol involving maximally entangled states across the noiseless segments and applying maximally entangled basis measurement at the corresponding nodes to achieve optimal fidelity. In this Letter, we propose a more efficient protocol for a certain class of noisy states in any intermediary segment, achieving the same fidelity as the standard protocol while consuming less amount of entanglement. Our approach ensures enhanced teleportation fidelity even when the end-to-end state gets noisier, and thus promises efficient utility of quantum resources in repeater-based distributed quantum protocols.</p>

            <h2>Quantum memory based on concatenating surface codes and quantum Hamming codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Menglong Fang, Daiqin Su</p>
            <p>Designing quantum error correcting codes that promise a high error threshold, low resource overhead and efficient decoding algorithms is crucial to achieve large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. The concatenated quantum Hamming code is one of the potential candidates that allows for constant space overhead and efficient decoding. We study the concatenation of surface codes with quantum Hamming codes as a quantum memory, and estimate its error threshold, resource overhead and decoding time. A high error threshold is achieved, which can in principle be pushed up to the threshold of the surface code. Furthermore, the concatenated codes can suppress logical errors to a much lower level than the surface codes, under the assumption of comparable amount of resource overhead. The advantage in suppressing errors starts to show for a quantum memory of intermediate scale. Concatenating surface codes with quantum Hamming codes therefore provides a promising avenue to demonstrate small-scale fault-tolerant quantum circuits in the near future, and also paves a way for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>The experimental identification of optically addressable spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride has opened new possibilities for quantum sensor technologies in two-dimensional materials and structures. Despite numerous fundamental and theoretical studies on the electronic structure of defects, the dynamics of the excited states are yet to be comprehensively investigated. The non-radiative relaxation pathways from the triplet excited states to the triplet ground states, particularly the one via a metastable intermediate state, remain largely presumed. A detailed identification, let alone a direct measurement of the rate constants, is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of the excited and intermediate states in the optical cycle under pulsed laser excitation in a broad temperature range. The focus is on the shelving intermediate state and resulting ground state spin polarization of an ensemble of optically pumped negatively charged boron vacancies. Our experiments show a relaxation time of 24 ns from the metastable state back to the ground state at room temperature. For low temperatures we find this time to approximately double - in accordance with a doubling of photoluminescence lifetime and intensity. Simulations show the evolution of the spin-populations in the five-level system and the polarization of the ground state depending on excitation rates. We thus optimize pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance sequences to account for the relaxation of the intermediate state. This yields significantly increased efficiency of the spin manipulation and hence, the sensitivity of the quantum sensor based on boron vacancies can be optimized considerably.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling nonlinear processes is crucial for engineering light-matter interaction and generating non-classical light. A significant challenge in ultra-thin nonlinear materials is the marked diminution of the nonlinear conversion efficiency due to the reduced light-matter interaction length and, in many cases, the centrosymmetric crystalline structures. Here we relax these limitations and report a giant boost of classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der Waals materials. Specifically, with a metal-nonlinear material heterostructure we enhance classical second-harmonic generation in h-BN flakes by two-orders of magnitude. Moreover, we have engineered a metal-SiO2-nonlinear material heterostructure resulting in a remarkable two orders of magnitude augmentation of the quantum spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in NbOCl2 flakes. Notably, we demonstrate SPDC in a 16 nm-thick NbOCl2 flake integrated into the proposed structure. These findings simplify on-chip quantum state engineering and accelerate the use of van der Waals materials in nonlinear optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme for enhancing bipartite quantum entanglement in a double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system incorporating an intracavity optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Utilizing a set of linearized quantum Langevin equations and numerical simulations, we investigate the impact of the OPA on both optical-vibration and vibration-vibration entanglement. Our key findings reveal a counterintuitive trade-off: while the OPA significantly enhances vibration-vibration entanglement, a critical resource for quantum memories and transducers, it simultaneously suppresses optical-vibration entanglement. We demonstrate that maximal vibration-vibration entanglement is achieved when the molecular collective vibrational modes are symmetrically populated, providing a clear experimental guideline for optimizing entanglement sources. In particular, the vibration-vibration entanglement generated in our OPA-enhanced McOM system exhibits remarkable robustness to thermal noise, persisting at temperatures approaching \SI{e3}{\kelvin}, significantly exceeding conventional optomechanical systems, and highlighting the potential for room temperature quantum information processing. These results establish a promising theoretical foundation for OPA-enhanced McOM systems as a robust and scalable platform for quantum technologies, paving the way for future experimental implementations and advanced quantum information processing applications.</p>

            <p>The quantum Bell nonlocality plays a crucial role in quantum information processing. In this paper, we first obtain the quantitative analytical expression of the genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality of any 4-qubit quantum state. Then, we investigate and derive the genuine four-partite nonlocalities in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole and the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. In the Schwarzschild black hole, it is shown that the Hawking effect destroys the accessible genuine four-partite nonlocality while simultaneously having both detrimental and beneficial impacts on the inaccessible genuine four-partite nonlocality. Besides, we observe that the Hawking effect can generate the physically inaccessible genuine four-partite nonlocality for fermion fields in Schwarzschild black hole. This result shows that the genuine four-partite nonlocality can pass through the event horizon of black hole. Moreover, we also investigate the influence of the Hawking effect of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime on the genuine four-partite nonlocality of massless Dirac fields.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Features of the Thermal Two-Qubit Quantum Rabi Model in Ultra- and Deep-Strong Regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciro Micheletti Diniz, Gabriella G. Damas, Norton G. de Almeida, Celso J. Villas Boas, G. D. de Moraes Neto</p>
            <p>Quantum correlations and non-classical states are indispensable resources for advancing quantum technologies, and their resilience at finite temperatures is crucial for practical experimental implementations. The two-qubit quantum Rabi model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and has been extensively studied in cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. In this work, we investigate the persistence of quantum correlations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, we demonstrate the emergence of long-lived quantum correlations, even in the presence of thermal noise. Notably, we uncover striking phenomena arising from the interplay between detuning and deep strong-coupling: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit energy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is characterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, we show that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining quantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of quantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing quantum technologies operating under realistic, finite-temperature conditions.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xulong Wang, Guancong Ma</p>
            <p>The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other. However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes. Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in non-Hermitian phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Sivan, Milan Šindelka, Meir Orenstein, Nimrod Moiseyev</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that calculating the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable resonance states (states with finite lifetimes embedded in the continuum) requires considering transitions to all continuum states, not just to lower states. This holds even when the lifetimes of the metastable states are very long and might be effectively considered as bound states in the continuum. However, employing complex-scaling transformations, this computationally prohibitive task becomes feasible by utilizing methods originally designed for excited bound states for calculation of complex poles of the scattering matrix. As an illustrative example, these methods are applied to calculate the spontaneous emission decay rates of metastable resonance states in a double-barrier potential. The rapid numerical convergence of this approach highlights a new avenue for studying spontaneous emission from metastable states in real-life systems, particularly in many-electron systems, where calculation of the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable resonances (e.g., autoionization states) is computationally difficult, if not impossible, using the standard (Hermitian) formalism of quantum mechanics.</p>

Despite this conventional wisdom, we present explicit local models in which all such phases persist to arbitrarily high temperature. This is possible since order in one degree of freedom can enable other degrees of freedom to strongly fluctuate, leading to "entropic order", whereby typical high energy states are ordered. Our construction, which utilizes interacting bosons, avoids existing no-go theorems on long-range order or entanglement at high temperature. We propose a simple model for high-temperature superconductivity using these general principles.</p>

            <p>Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</p>

            <h2>Strongly coupled photonic molecules as doubly-coupled oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin C. Smith, Austin G. Nixon, David J. Masiello</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a first-principles theoretical model of strongly coupled photonic molecules composed of interacting dielectric cavities. We demonstrate the predictive power of this model, illustrating the ability to compute supermode eigenfrequencies, field profiles, and mode volumes, given only knowledge of the individual cavity mode profiles and dielectric background, without expensive electromagnetic simulations on the composite structure or numerical fitting. While our model affirms the phenomenological approach of modeling coupled cavity modes as simple coordinate-coupled oscillators in the weak coupling regime, we show that this intuition remarkably breaks down for strong coupling. Instead, we demonstrate that strongly coupled cavity modes are analogous to harmonic oscillators we term as doubly coupled, with interactions via electric and magnetic fields appearing as independent coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum couplings, respectively. We show that this distinction is not merely cosmetic, but gives rise to observable properties while providing deep insights into the physical mechanism behind previously observed phenomena, such as coupling induced frequency shifts. Finally, we illustrate that the complex interplay of these dual couplings suggests the possibility to realize exotic phenomena that typically only occur in the ultrastrong coupling regime, here predicted to emerge for comparably modest mode splittings within a regime we term pseudo-ultrastrong coupling.</p>

I prove a thermodynamic limitation on the information that can be obtained about a classical system by means of observations: A direct analogue of the Robertson-Schrödinger quantum uncertainty relation controls the acquisition of information at the classical microscale. Central to this theorem is the notion of the "quality" of a measuring probe; a temperature-dependent strictly positive quantity that serves as a figure of merit of the probe, and that plays the role of $1/\hbar$ in the classical uncertainty relation. This study sets the stage for a new area of research into resource theories of classical measurement, in which high-quality measurements and high-information states of knowledge are the limited resources.</p>

            <p>We introduce Qunity, a new quantum programming language designed to treat quantum computing as a natural generalization of classical computing. Qunity presents a unified syntax where familiar programming constructs can have both quantum and classical effects. For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked BQP subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of "garbage" outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity's syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms. We also detail how Qunity can be compiled into a low-level qubit circuit language like OpenQASM, proving the realizability of our design.</p>

Improved constraints for the coupling $g_A^e g_V^N$ are established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 mm to 1.5 mm. And the constraint $|g_A^e g_V^N| \leq 4.39 \times10^{-26}$ at $\lambda$ = 0.5 mm at the $95 \%$ confidence level, significantly surpasses previous results by more than three orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction.

            <p>Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer promising capabilities for complex data tasks, but are often constrained by limited qubit resources and high entanglement, which can hinder scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Threshold Pruning (ATP), an encoding method that reduces entanglement and optimizes data complexity for efficient computations in QNNs. ATP dynamically prunes non-essential features in the data based on adaptive thresholds, effectively reducing quantum circuit requirements while preserving high performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that ATP reduces entanglement entropy and improves adversarial robustness when combined with adversarial training methods like FGSM. Our results highlight ATPs ability to balance computational efficiency and model resilience, achieving significant performance improvements with fewer resources, which will help make QNNs more feasible in practical, resource-constrained settings.</p>

            <p>A quantum many-body scar is an eigenstate of a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian that exhibits two seemingly incongruous properties: its energy eigenvalue corresponds to a high temperature, yet its entanglement structure resembles that of low-temperature eigenstates, such as ground states. Traditionally, a temperature is assigned to an energy \emph{eigenvalue} through the textbook canonical temperature-energy relationship. However, in this work, we use the \emph{eigenstate subsystem temperature} -- a recently developed quantity that assigns a temperature to an energy eigenstate, based on the structure of its reduced density matrix. For a thermal state, the eigenstate subsystem temperature is approximately equal to its canonical temperature. Given that quantum many-body scars have a ground-state-like entanglement structure, it is not immediately clear that their eigenstate subsystem temperature would be close to their canonical temperature. Surprisingly, we find that this is the case: the quantum many-body scars have approximate ``knowledge'' of their position in the spectrum encoded within their state structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.</p>

            <p>The concept of compatibility originally emerged as a synonym for the commutativity of observables and later evolved into the notion of measurement compatibility. In any case, however, it has remained predominantly algebraic in nature, tied to the formalism of quantum mechanics. Recently, still within the quantum domain, the concept of context incompatibility has been proposed as a resource for detecting eavesdropping in quantum communication channels. Here, we propose a significant generalization of this concept by introducing the notion of theory-independent context compatibility, a concept that is trivially satisfied by classical statistical theory but is found in conflict with quantum mechanics. Moreover, we propose a figure of merit capable of quantifying the degree of violation of theory-independent context incompatibility, and we experimentally demonstrate, using a quantum optics platform, that quantum systems can exhibit pronounced degrees of violation. Besides yielding a concept that extends to generic probabilistic theories and retrieving the notion of measurement incompatibility in the quantum domain, our results offer a promising perspective on evaluating the role of incompatibility in the manifestation of non-local correlations.</p>

            <p>We propose a model for quantum computing with long chains of trapped ions and we design quantum error correction schemes for this model. The main components of a quantum error correction scheme are the quantum code and a quantum circuit called the syndrome extraction circuit, which is executed to perform error correction with this code. In this work, we design syndrome extraction circuits tailored to our ion chain model, a syndrome extraction tuning protocol to optimize these circuits, and we construct new quantum codes that outperform the state-of-the-art for chains of about $50$ qubits. To establish a baseline under the ion chain model, we simulate the performance of surface codes and bivariate bicycle (BB) codes equipped with our optimized syndrome extraction circuits. Then, we propose a new variant of BB codes defined by weight-five measurements, that we refer to as BB5 codes, and we identify BB5 codes that achieve a better minimum distance than any BB codes with the same number of logical qubits and data qubits, such as $[[30, 4, 5]]$ and $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 codes. For a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, the $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code achieves a logical error rate per logical qubit of $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$, which is four times smaller than the best BB code in our baseline family. It also achieves the same logical error rate per logical qubit as the distance-7 surface code but using four times fewer physical qubits per logical qubit.</p>

            <h2>Towards robust variational quantum simulation of Lindblad dynamics via stochastic Magnus expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Cheng Huang, Hao-En Li, Yi-Cheng Wang, Guang-Ze Zhang, Jun Li, Han-Shi Hu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a novel and general framework for the variational quantum simulation of Lindblad equations. Building on the close relationship between nonlinearly unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in terms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples, including the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) with damping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model (RPM). The precision of the simulation can be systematically improved, and its reliability is confirmed even in the highly oscillatory regime. These methods are expected to extend their applicability beyond the particular systems analyzed in this study.</p>

            <p>Constructing an efficient and robust quantum memory is central to the challenge of engineering feasible quantum computer architectures. Quantum error correction codes can solve this problem in theory, but without careful design it can introduce daunting requirements that call for machines many orders of magnitude larger than what is available today. Bringing these requirements down can often be achieved by tailoring the codes to mitigate the specific forms of noise known to be present. Using a Quantinuum H1 quantum computer, we report on a robust quantum memory design using a concatenated code, with the low-level code designed to mitigate the dominant source of memory error, and a higher-level error correction scheme to enable robust computation. The resulting encoding scheme, known as a decoherence-free subspace quantum error correction code, is characterized for long probe times, and shown to extend the memory time by over an order of magnitude compared to physical qubits.</p>

            <h2>Fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise using Bacon-Shor codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long D. H. My, Akshaya Jayashankar, Prabha Mandayam, Hui Khoon Ng</p>
            <p>Designing efficient fault tolerance schemes is crucial for building useful quantum computers. Most standard schemes assume no knowledge of the underlying device noise and rely on general-purpose quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes capable of handling arbitrary errors. Biased-noise alternatives focus on only correcting a subset of some generic error basis (e.g., Pauli error basis), and lower resource needs by channeling the redundancy to dealing only with that subset. Yet, the most resource-efficient codes are expected to be those that directly target the specific noise process that afflicts the quantum device, rather than using a generic error-basis description. However, the question of whether such noise-adapted QEC protocols are amenable to fault-tolerant implementations remains largely unexplored. Here, we design a fault tolerance scheme based on the Bacon-Shor codes which can protect against amplitude-damping noise in the device. We construct a universal set of logical gadgets tolerant to multiple damping errors and estimate the fault tolerance threshold of our scheme. Our work thus establishes the possibility of achieving fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise using noise-adapted quantum codes, while highlighting some of the unique challenges that arise in this context.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing Non-Markovian Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sohail Reddy</p>
            <p>Characterizing non-Markovian quantum dynamics is essential for accurately modeling open quantum systems, particularly in near-term quantum technologies. In this work, we develop a structure-preserving approach to characterizing non-Markovian evolution using the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation, considering both linear and nonlinear formulations. To parameterize the master equation, we explore two distinct techniques: the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion, which provides an optimal basis representation of the dynamics, and neural networks, which offer a data-driven approach to learning system-environment interactions. We demonstrate our methodology using experimental data from a superconducting qubit at the Quantum Device Integration Testbed (QuDIT) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Our results show that while neural networks can capture complex dependencies, the KL expansion yields the most accurate predictions of the qubit's non-Markovian dynamics, highlighting its effectiveness in structure-preserving quantum system characterization. These findings provide valuable insights into efficient modeling strategies for open quantum systems, with implications for quantum control and error mitigation in near-term quantum processors.</p>

            <p>A promising platform for quantum information research relies on cavity coupled atomic spin-waves, enabling efficient operations such as quantum memories, quantum light generation and entanglement distribution. In this work, we study the strong coupling between non-classical collective spin excitations generated by Raman scattering in a cold $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic ensemble, and a single cavity mode. We report on an intracavity spin wave to single photon conversion efficiency of up to $\chi=0.75 \pm 0.02$ in the quantum domain, as evidenced by a violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Our work establishes a relationship between the retrieval of an atomic spin wave in the non-classical regime and the vacuum-Rabi splitting. We show that this relationship emerges within the efficiency spectrum, and we finally provide the optimal operational conditions to achieve the maximum intrinsic retrieval efficiency. Our data is well reproduced by simulations based on optical Bloch equations. This work deepens the understanding of cavity-enhanced spin wave readout and its potential applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum memories are essential for photonic quantum technologies, enabling long-distance quantum communication and serving as delay units in quantum computing. Hot atomic vapors using electromagnetically induced transparency provide a simple platform with second-long photon storage capabilities. Light-guiding structures enhance performance, but current hollow-core fiber waveguides face significant limitations in filling time, physical size, fabrication versatility, and large-scale integration potential. In this work, we demonstrate the storage of attenuated coherent light pulses in a cesium (Cs) quantum memory based on a 3D-nanoprinted hollow-core waveguide, known as a light cage (LC), with several hundred nanoseconds of storage times. Leveraging the versatile fabrication process, we successfully integrated multiple LC memories onto a single chip within a Cs vapor cell, achieving consistent performance across all devices. We conducted a detailed investigation into storage efficiency, analyzing memory lifetime and bandwidth. These results represent a significant advancement toward spatially multiplexed quantum memories and have the potential to elevate memory integration to unprecedented levels. We anticipate applications in parallel single-photon synchronization for quantum repeater nodes and photonic quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>Attosecond science relies on driving electrons after photoemission with the strong optical field of a laser pulse, representing an intense classical coherent state of light. Bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) is a quantum state of light intense enough to drive strong-field physics. However, its mean optical electric field is zero, suggesting that, in a semiclassical view, electrons should not experience strong driving. The question arises if and how this quantum state of light can generate attosecond science signatures in strong-field photoemission. Here we show that the key signatures of strong-field physics - the high energy plateau and the 10-$U_\mathrm{p}$-cut-off - also appear under BSV driving of a needle tip, but only when we post-select electron energy spectra on the individual photon number of each BSV pulse. When averaging over many BSV shots, we observe broad energy spectra featuring no plateau. This suggests that BSV-driven electrons behave as if driven by an ensemble of coherent states of light. Our findings bridge strong-field physics and quantum optics, offering insights into BSV and other quantum light states. Our work paves the way for electron quantum state engineering and the use of strongly driven electrons as quantum light sensors.</p>

            <p>Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junsen Wang, Xiangxiang Sun, Wei Zheng</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc M Dignam, Marco Liscidini</p>
            <p>We present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating the squeezing and antisqueezing spectrum in a channel waveguide side-coupled to a lossy ring resonator. Our approach first uses the semi-analytic evolution of the density matrix inside the ring up to the time where the squeezing is maximized. Then noting that a conservative approximate result for the squeezing can be obtained by ignoring the effect of the pump at later times, we calculate the free evolution of the field operators in the channel waveguide at all later times. We then calculate the quadrature squeezing spectrum in the waveguide, assuming that the measurement starts at the time when the squeezing in the ring is maximized. Using these results, we determine the optimum values for the pump pulse duration and amplitude and the ring-channel coupling for the pump and signal. We find that squeezing above 10 dB can be easily achieved in the channel for antisqueezing levels of less than 22 dB.</p>

            <p>We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term quantum chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term quantum hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ayyash, Sahel Ashhab</p>
            <p>The dispersive regime of $n$-photon qubit-oscillator interactions is analyzed using Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an $n$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an $(n-1)$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional $2n$-photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing their desired nonlinear effects.</p>

We further discuss a physical implementation of such a quantum repeater comprising a microwave cavity and a superconducting transmon, capable of state engineering with high fidelities ($>97\%$) and logical Bell state measurements for successful entanglement swapping. As an alternative approach, we also discuss a realization in the all-optical domain.</p>

            <p>The Transformer model, renowned for its powerful attention mechanism, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various artificial intelligence tasks but faces challenges such as high computational cost and memory usage. Researchers are exploring quantum computing to enhance the Transformer's design, though it still shows limited success with classical data. With a growing focus on leveraging quantum machine learning for quantum data, particularly in quantum chemistry, we propose the Molecular Quantum Transformer (MQT) for modeling interactions in molecular quantum systems. By utilizing quantum circuits to implement the attention mechanism on the molecular configurations, MQT can efficiently calculate ground-state energies for all configurations. Numerical demonstrations show that in calculating ground-state energies for H_2, LiH, BeH_2, and H_4, MQT outperforms the classical Transformer, highlighting the promise of quantum effects in Transformer structures. Furthermore, its pretraining capability on diverse molecular data facilitates the efficient learning of new molecules, extending its applicability to complex molecular systems with minimal additional effort. Our method offers an alternative to existing quantum algorithms for estimating ground-state energies, opening new avenues in quantum chemistry and materials science.</p>

To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.</p>

In particular, the embedding techniques based on Hamiltonian simulation techniques enable the loading of matrices into quantum computers. A representative example of these methods is the Lloyd-Mohseni-Rebentrost protocol, which efficiently implements matrix exponentiation when multiple copies of a quantum state are available. However, this is a quite ideal set up, and in a realistic scenario, the copies are limited and the non-cloning theorem prevents from producing more exact copies in order to increase the accuracy of the protocol. Here, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation by introducing imperfect quantum copies, which significantly improve the performance of the LMR when the eigenvectors are known.</p>

            <p>We introduce state-of-the-art protocols to distill indistinguishable photons, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, while using a modest amount of resources scaling only linearly in $n$. Our resource requirements are both significantly lower and have fewer hardware requirements than previous works, making large-scale distillation experimentally feasible for the first time. This efficient reduction of distinguishability error rates has direct applications to fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computation, potentially leading to improved thresholds for photon loss errors and allowing smaller code distances, thus reducing overall resource costs. Our protocols are based on Fourier transforms on finite abelian groups, special cases of which include the discrete Fourier transform and Hadamard matrices. This general perspective allows us to unify previous results on distillation protocols and introduce a large family of efficient schemes. We utilize the rich mathematical structure of Fourier transforms, including symmetries and related suppression laws, to quantify the performance of these distillation protocols both analytically and numerically. Finally, our work resolves an open question concerning suppression laws for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform: the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law if and only if $n$ is a prime power.</p>

            <p>Continuously monitoring a quantum system can strongly affect its properties and even suppress its coherent evolution via the Quantum Zeno effect. Well understood for few body quantum systems, the role of quantum measurements on entangled many-body states is still largely unexplored. Here we focus on one of the simplest entangled many-body state, arising via the Kondo effect in a strongly interacting quantum dot coupled to a metallic bath, and investigate the effect of continuous monitoring of the dot total charge. We show that the decay rate of an initially polarized spin displays a crossover from Kondo screening, with a decay rate controlled by interactions, to Quantum Zeno effect, with a decay rate which decreases with bare dissipation as the monitoring rate is increased. Remarkably we show that the long-lived Kondo state is robust to weak dissipation, as further confirmed by the dot spectral function which features a clear Kondo peak at finite dissipation, even in a regime where charge fluctuations and the associated Hubbard bands have been quenched by the monitoring protocol. We derive an effective model for the long-time dynamics which is described, at weak dissipation, by a non-Hermitian Kondo model with complex-valued spin exchange which is known to host exotic low-energy physics and a dissipative phase transition between Kondo and non-Kondo steady-state. Finally, as the dephasing is increased heating due to doublon production takes over and control the spin decay.</p>

We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).</p>

            <h2>An entanglement protocol to measure atomic parity violation at sub 0.1% precision</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana P. L. Aude Craik</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a scheme to measure atomic parity violation (APV) in barium ions at <0.1% precision. The scheme is based on using multi-ion entangled states to common-mode reject parity-conserving systematic shifts and selectively detect a parity-violating vector light shift. This measurement protocol eliminates the need to suppress a leading systematic by 11 orders of magnitude, as is required in the single-ion measurement scheme [N. Fortson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2383 (1993)]. Furthermore, the protocol can be combined with the use of integrated photonic waveguides in an architecture that is scalable to large ion numbers, with a proportional increase in measurement precision.</p>

            <h2>Variational M-Partite Geometric Entanglement Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vahid Azimi-Mousolou, Prashant Singh</p>
            <p>We propose a variational quantum algorithm to evaluate the $M$-partite geometric entanglement across arbitrary partitions of an $N$-qubit system into $M$ parties. By constructing tailored variational ansatz circuits for both single- and multi-qubit parties, we optimize the overlap between a target quantum state and an $M$-partite variational separable state. This method provides a flexible and scalable approach for characterizing arbitrary $M$-partite entanglement in complex quantum systems of a given dimension. We assess the accuracy of the proposed method by reproducing known analytical results and demonstrate its capability to evaluate entanglement among $M$ parties for any given conventional or unconventional partitions of one- and two-dimensional spin systems, both near and at a quantum critical point. Our results establish the versatility of the variational approach in capturing different types of entanglement in various quantum systems, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. Our approach offers a powerful methodology for advancing research in quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and quantum field theory. Additionally, we discuss its advantages, highlighting its adaptability to diverse system architectures in the context of near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>High-efficiency vertical emission spin-photon interface for scalable quantum memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siavash Mirzaei-Ghormish, Jeddy Bennet, Ryan M. Camacho</p>
            <p>We present an efficient spin-photon interface for free-space vertical emission coupling. Using a digital twin approach, we show that our design achieves a far-field collection efficiency of 96\% at the numerical aperture of 0.7 with a 95\% overlap to a Gaussian mode. Our approach is based on a dual perturbation layer design. The first perturbation layer extracts and redirects the resonant mode of a diamond microdisk resonator around the optical axis. The second perturbation layer suppresses side lobes and concentrates most of the light intensity near the center. This dual-layer design enhances control over the farfield pattern and also reduces alignment sensitivity. Additionally, the implemented digital twin performs calculations \( 7 \times 10^6 \) times faster than full-wave FDTD simulations. These features make the design promising for quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroo Azuma, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto</p>
            <p>We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we show that multiphoton JCHM reveals quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI), superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phases. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. If this conserved quantity diverges to infinity, this system is in the BEC phase. Exploring this system we observe the MI, BEC, and superfluid phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs although the two-photon JCHM MI phases are restricted to the small conserved quantity subspace. Contrastingly, only the superfluid and BEC phases arise in the three- and four-photon JCHMs (the MI phase is not observed).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Bo Hou, Rui-Zhe You, Di-Jia Zhang, Pengbo Li, Changchun Zhong</p>
            <p>Quantum transduction is a key technology for connecting different quantum technologies across varied frequencies. However, it remains a major challenge to overcome the high threshold for achieving positive capacity of traditional quantum transduction channels. Recently, an entanglement-assisted transducer was proposed based on a cavity-optic system [Opt. Quantum 2, 475 (2024)], where a modified bosonic loss channel was obtained, and the transduction efficiency can be enhanced by properly tuning the squeezing parameters. In this paper, we further identify three types of quantum channels enabled by this design, offering additional options for implementing the proposed transduction schemes. Compared to the transducers without entanglement assistance, the scheme also shows a great enhancement in the conversion bandwidth for achieving high quantum capacity, further increasing its value in practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Cavity quantum electrodynamics with single perovskite quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zakaria Said, Marina Cagnon Trouche, Antoine Borel, Mohamed-Raouf Amara, Jakob Reichel, Christophe Voisin, Carole Diederichs, Yannick Chassagneux</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters of single indistinguishable photons play a key role in quantum technologies. Among condensed matter systems, colloidal perovskite quantum dots have emerged as promising candidates, exhibiting high-purity single photon emission at room temperature and two-photon interference visibilities up to 0.5 at cryogenic temperatures. Achieving deterministic coupling of individual perovskite quantum dots to photonic structures is now a critical step towards harnessing cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) effects, such as the Purcell effect, to enhance single photon emission rate and indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic and reversible coupling of individual CsPbBr$_{3}$ perovskite quantum dots to a tunable, high-quality factor, low mode volume fiber-based Fabry-Pérot microcavity at 10~\si{\kelvin}. By spatially and spectrally tuning the cavity mode in resonance with the quantum dot emission, we observe up to a twofold increase in single photon emission rates. We build on the original multiplet excitonic fine structure to assess the vacuum Rabi coupling strength ($g \simeq$ 40~\si{\micro eV}) from the shaping of the spectral profile of the emission upon increasing the electromagnetic confinement. This approach also made it possible to delineate the contributions of spectral diffusion and pure dephasing to the total linewidth of emission, paving the way to a fully optimized control of the emission properties of cavity coupled perovskite quantum dots.</p>

            <h2>Electric Field Distortions in Surface Ion Traps with Integrated Nanophotonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guochun Du, Elena Jordan, Tanja E. Mehlstaeubler</p>
            <p>The integration of photonic components into surface ion traps provides a scalable approach for trapped-ion quantum computing, sensing, and metrology, enabling compact systems with enhanced stability and precision. However, the introduction of optical apertures in the trap electrodes can distort the trapping electric field. This can lead to excess micromotion (EMM) and ion displacement which degrade the performance of quantum logic operations and optical clocks. In this work, we systematically investigate the electric field distortion in a surface ion trap with integrated waveguides and grating couplers using Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We analyze methods to reduce these distortions by exploiting symmetries and transparent conductive oxide materials.</p>

            <h2>Fast and Noise-aware Machine Learning Variational Quantum Eigensolver Optimiser</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akib Karim, Shaobo Zhang, Muhammad Usman</p>
            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for preparing ground states in the current era of noisy devices. The classical component of the algorithm requires a large number of measurements on intermediate parameter values that are typically discarded. However, intermediate steps across many calculations can contain valuable information about the relationship between the quantum circuit parameters, resultant measurements, and noise specific to the device. In this work, we use supervised machine learning on the intermediate parameter and measurement data to predict optimal final parameters. Our technique optimises parameters leading to chemically accurate ground state energies much faster than conventional techniques. It requires significantly fewer iterations and simultaneously shows resilience to coherent errors if trained on noisy devices. We demonstrate this technique on IBM quantum devices by predicting ground state energies of H$_2$ for one and two qubits; H$_3$ for three qubits; and HeH$^+$ for four qubits where it finds optimal angles using only modeled data for training.</p>

            <h2>Efficient hyperentanglement-based quantum secret sharing protocol</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Zhang, Fu-Le Hao, Shi-Pu Gu, Xing-Fu Wang, Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng</p>
            <p>Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a typical multipartite cryptographic primitive, which is an important part of quantum communication network. Existing QSS protocols generally require basis selection and matching, which would increase the quantum resource consumption and classical communication round, and also face weak random security vulnerabilities. We propose an efficient hyperentanglement-based QSS protocol without the basis selection, in which the dealer and partners share a polarization-momentum hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and encode keys in the polarization degree of freedom (DOF). The dealer decodes the transmitted keys relying on the nonlocal hyperentanglement-assisted polarization GHZ state analysis. Our QSS protocol is unconditionally secure in theory. We develop simulation method to estimate its performance in practical environment. Compared with the QSS based on the GHZ state, our protocol has several advantages. First, it does not require basis selection and can completely distinguish eight polarization GHZ states, which can improve the utilization rate of entanglement resources to 100$\%$ and increase the key generation rate by an order of magnitude. Second, it only requires one round of classical communication, and thus can reduce key generation time by 69.4$\%$. Third, it can eliminate the weak random security vulnerabilities associated with the basis selection. Finally, our protocol only uses linear optical elements, which makes it practically feasible. Our QSS protocol has potential application in future quantum communication network.</p>

            <h2>Transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in monitored quantum dynamics with homogeneous unitary gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>We explore the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in systems evolved by quantum measurements and spatially homogeneous unitary gates. In models with temporally random and Floquet unitary gates, we find that the Lyapunov exponents typically converge to values independent of measurement outcomes and that spectral transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement transitions of ground states occur at the same measurement thresholds. Our results indicate that (i) randomness due to quantum measurements is enough, or equivalently, randomness of unitary gates is not essential, for the typical convergence of the Lyapunov spectrum and that (ii) the correspondence between the spectral transition and entanglement transition is ubiquitous in a wide range of systems. We also discuss why the typical convergence occurs, in light of the uniqueness and positive definiteness of stationary states in the completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamics averaged over random measurement outcomes.</p>

            <p>While quantum computers have the potential to perform a wide range of practically important tasks beyond the capabilities of classical computers, realizing this potential remains a challenge. One such task is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy. Certified randomness has many applications but is fundamentally impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations: a client generates quantum "challenge" circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute, and verifies the server's results. We analyze the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of $1.1\times10^{18}$ floating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify $71,313$ bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of today's quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Large-scale operations in quantum networks require efficient sorting of desired paths between nodes. In this article, we consider entanglement routing, which involves establishing an entanglement link between specific nodes in a large network of bosonic nodes. The networks are continuous-variable graph states built from finite squeezing and passive linear optics, shaped by complex network structures that mimic real-world networks. We construct a bipartite routing protocol with the specific goal of establishing a teleportation channel between two clients via passive optics operations locally operated by two different providers sharing the network. We provide criteria for extracting the aforementioned channel and, through the use of a derandomised evolutionary algorithm, extend the existing framework to study complex graph topologies.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Incompatible Observables with Quantum Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muchun Yang, Yibin Huang, D. L. Zhou</p>
            <p>The Heisenberg uncertainty principle imposes a fundamental restriction in quantum mechanics, stipulating that measuring one observable completely erases the information on its conjugate one, thereby preventing simultaneous measurements of incompatible observables. Quantum neural networks (QNNs) is one of the most significant applications on near-term devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we demonstrate that by implementing a multiple-output QNN that emulates a unital quantum channel, one can measure the expectation values of many incompatible observables simultaneously by Pauli-$Z$ measurements on distinct output qubits. We prove the existence of such quantum channel, derive analytical scaling constraints of the measured expectation values, and validate this framework by numerical simulations of observables learning tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals that it requires fewer copies of state when measuring some incompatible observables by the multiple-output QNNs, which demonstrates a resource efficiency advantage compared to separately applying projective measurements.</p>

            <h2>Improving Variational Quantum Circuit Optimization via Hybrid Algorithms and Random Axis Initialization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joona V. Pankkonen, Lauri Ylinen, Matti Raasakka, Ilkka Tittonen</p>
            <p>Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are an essential tool in applying noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers to practical problems. VQCs are used as a central component in many algorithms, for example, in quantum machine learning, optimization, and quantum chemistry. Several methods have been developed to optimize VQCs. In this work, we enhance the performance of the well-known Rotosolve method, a gradient-free optimization algorithm specifically designed for VQCs. We develop two hybrid algorithms that combine an improved version of Rotosolve with the free quaternion selection (FQS) algorithm, which is the main focus of this study. Through numerical simulations, we observe that these hybrid algorithms achieve higher accuracy and better average performance across different ansatz circuit sizes and cost functions. For shallow variational circuits, we identify a trade-off between the expressivity of the variational ansatz and the speed of convergence to the optimum: a more expressive ansatz ultimately reaches a closer approximation to the true minimum, but at the cost of requiring more circuit evaluations for convergence. By combining the less expressive but fast-converging Rotosolve with the more expressive FQS, we construct hybrid algorithms that benefit from the rapid initial convergence of Rotosolve while leveraging the superior expressivity of FQS. As a result, these hybrid approaches outperform either method used independently.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum-classical approaches offer potential solutions to quantum chemistry problems, yet they often manifest as constrained optimization problems. Here, we explore the interconnection between constrained optimization and generalized eigenvalue problems through the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) excitation generators. Inspired by the generator coordinate method, we employ these UCC excitation generators to construct non-orthogonal, overcomplete many-body bases, projecting the system Hamiltonian into an effective Hamiltonian, which bypasses issues such as barren plateaus that heuristic numerical minimizers often encountered in standard variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Diverging from conventional quantum subspace expansion methods, we introduce an adaptive scheme that robustly constructs the many-body basis sets from a pool of the UCC excitation generators. This scheme supports the development of a hierarchical ADAPT quantum-classical strategy, enabling a balanced interplay between subspace expansion and ansatz optimization to address complex, strongly correlated quantum chemical systems cost-effectively, setting the stage for more advanced quantum simulations in chemistry.</p>

            <p>Finding a quantum battery model that demonstrates a quantum advantage while remaining feasible for experimental production is a considerable challenge. Here, a superconducting quantum battery (SQB) model that exhibits such an advantage is introduced. The model consists of two coupled superconducting qubits that interact during the unitary charging process while remaining in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. First, the model is described, evidence of the quantum advantage is provided, and then the fabrication process of the battery is discussed using superconducting qubits. Analytical expressions for the ergotropy, instantaneous power, and capacity of the SQB, as well as their connection to quantum coherence are derived. It is demonstrated that leveraging the collective effects of Josephson energies and the coupling energy between qubits allows for optimization, resulting in improved energy redistribution and a significant enhancement in charging efficiency. This work highlights the complexities of tuning system parameters, which increase the potential for work extraction from the SQB, providing a deeper understanding of the charging mechanisms involved. These findings can be applied to superconducting quantum circuit battery architectures, underscoring the feasibility of efficient energy storage in these systems. These results pave the way for proposals of new superconducting devices, emphasizing their potential for efficient energy storage.</p>

We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion.

            <p>The self-attention mechanism has revolutionized classical machine learning, yet its quantum counterpart remains underexplored in fully harnessing the representational power of quantum states. Current quantum self-attention models exhibit a critical limitation by neglecting the indispensable phase information inherent in quantum systems when compressing attention weights into real-valued overlaps. To address this fundamental gap, we propose the Quantum Complex-Valued Self-Attention Model (QCSAM), the first framework that explicitly leverages complex-valued similarities between quantum states to capture both amplitude and phase relationships. Simultaneously, we enhance the standard Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCUs) method by introducing a Complex LCUs (CLCUs) framework that natively supports complex-valued coefficients. This framework enables the weighting of corresponding quantum values using fixed quantum complex self-attention weights, while also supporting trainable complex-valued parameters for value aggregation and quantum multi-head attention. Experimental evaluations on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrate our model's superiority over recent quantum self-attention architectures including QKSAN, QSAN, and GQHAN, with multi-head configurations showing consistent advantages over single-head variants. We systematically evaluate model scalability through qubit configurations ranging from 3 to 8 qubits and multi-class classification tasks spanning 2 to 4 categories. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we establish the critical advantage of complex-valued quantum attention weights over real-valued alternatives.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emission of a qubit weakly coupled to a one-band coupled-cavity array where, due to an engineered gradient in the cavity frequencies, photons are effectively accelerated by a synthetic force F. For strong F, a reversible emission described by an effective Jaynes-Cummings model occurs, causing a chiral time-periodic excitation of an extensive region of the array, either to the right or to the left of the qubit depending on its frequency. For weak values of F instead, a complex non-Markovian decay with revivals shows up. This is reminiscent of dynamics induced by mirrors in standard waveguides, despite the absence of actual mirrors, and can be attributed to the finite width of the energy band which confines the motion of the emitted photon. In a suitable regime, the decay is well described by a delay differential equation formally analogous to the one governing the decay of an atom in a multi-mode cavity where the cavity length and time taken by a photon to travel between the two mirrors are now embodied by the amplitude and period of Bloch oscillations, respectively.</p>

The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as Axion-like particle (ALP) or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity.

            <p>Achieving unit fidelity in quantum state preparation is often impossible in the presence of environmental decoherence. While continuous monitoring and feedback control can improve fidelity, perfect state preparation remains elusive in many scenarios. Inspired by quantum speed limits, we derive an ultimate bound on the steady-state average fidelity achievable via continuous monitoring and feedback control. This bound depends only on the unconditional Lindblad dynamics, the maximum control Hamiltonian strength, and the target state. We also adapt the bound to the case of Markovian feedback strategies. We then focus on preparing Dicke states in an atomic ensemble subject to collective damping and dispersive coupling. By imposing additional constraints on control Hamiltonians and monitoring strategies, we derive tighter fidelity bounds. Finally, we propose specific control strategies and validate them using reinforcement learning. Benchmarking their performance against our theoretical bounds highlights the relevance and usefulness of these bounds in characterizing quantum feedback control strategies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Cesa, Hannes Bernien, Hannes Pichler</p>
            <p>Quantum devices can process data in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. To leverage this potential, many algorithms require the aid of a quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), i.e. a module capable of efficiently loading datasets (both classical and quantum) onto the quantum processor. However, a realization of this fundamental building block is still outstanding, since existing proposals require prohibitively many resources for reliable implementations, or are not compatible with current architectures. Moreover, present approaches cannot be scaled-up, as they do not allow for efficient quantum error-correction. Here we develop a QRAM design, that enables fast and robust QRAM calls, naturally allows for fault-tolerant and error-corrected operation, and can be integrated on present hardware. Our proposal employs a special quantum resource state that is consumed during the QRAM call: we discuss how it can be assembled and processed efficiently in a dedicated module, and give detailed blueprints for modern neutral-atom processors. Our work places a long missing, fundamental component of quantum computers within reach of currently available technology; this opens the door to algorithms featuring practical quantum advantage, including search or oracular problems, quantum chemistry and machine learning.</p>

            <p>We investigate a generalized quantum Rabi model (QRM) with two- and four-photon terms with respect to applications for non-linear critical quantum metrology. In the introduced model, the spectral collapse occurring in the standard two-photon QRM is stabilized by the presence of the quartic potential. The collapse is then transformed into a quantum phase transition, which occurs in the low-frequency limit of the light mode, whose remnant at finite ratio between qubit and mode frequencies can be applied to critically enhanced quantum metrology. We find that the four-photon term entails a much higher measurement precision compared to the standard two-photon QRM. The mechanism behind the higher precision can be traced to the different behavior of the ground state wave function as the system is tuned through the transition. As the standard two-photon QRM, despite the absence of the spectral collapse, our model allows for a finite preparation time for the probe state (PTPS).</p>

            <h2>Highly efficient microwave memory using a superconducting artificial chiral atom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-I Chu, Yung-Fu Chen, Wen-Te Liao</p>
            <p>A microwave memory using a superconducting artificial chiral atom embedded in a one-dimensional open transmission line is theoretically investigated. By applying a coupling field to a single artificial atom, we modify its dispersion, resulting in a slow probe pulse similar to electromagnetically induced transparency. The single atom's intrinsic chirality, along with optimal control of the coupling field, enables a storage efficiency exceeding 99% and near-unity fidelity across a broad range of pulse durations. Our scheme provides a feasible pathway toward highly efficient quantum information processing in superconducting circuits.</p>

            <h2>Photon-Mediated Atomic Interactions in Curved Surface Settings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maor Carmi, Michal Roth, Rivka Bekenstein</p>
            <p>Subwavelength atomic lattices have emerged as a promising platform for quantum applications, leveraging collective superradiant and subradiant effects to enhance light-matter interactions. Integrating atomic lattices into nanostructures is at the front of effort toward any application with atomic lattices, but is still a challenging theoretical task, as the dipole interactions are hard to model in arbitrary dielectric environment. Here, we develop a formalism that allows the embedding of emitters to a wide class of thin curved waveguides, by greatly simplifying the wave equation and consequentially the dipole interactions. We demonstrate the formalism for locally constant positive curved surfaces, where we derive a new surface Green function that allows exact computation of the collective superradiant and subradiant states. We also show how the curvature and the thickness of the waveguides affects the collective states through an effective surface wavelength.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Couture, Frédéric Bouchard, Alicia Sit, Guillaume Thekkadath, Duncan England, Philip J. Bustard, Benjamin J. Sussman</p>
            <p>The manipulation of visible and near-infrared light at the single-photon level plays a key role in quantum communication systems where information is encoded into photonic degrees of freedom. In practical implementations, it is important to achieve this manipulation with high speeds, low loss, and low noise. In this work, we propose the use of terahertz~(THz) electric fields as a pump source for electro-optic modulation of single photons in bulk media. We demonstrate spectral modulations of single photons in the form of frequency translation and bandwidth manipulations as the terahertz field imparts linear and quadratic phases on the photons at various time delays within 1~ps. Our results show frequency translations exceeding 500~GHz at multi-THz modulation speeds and loss levels of $\approx$1~dB, complementing the current state-of-the-art electro-optic modulation techniques limited to speeds up to 100~GHz. The proposed approach leverages recent developments in terahertz generation techniques, introducing new avenues to manipulate non-classical light in an unexplored regime for quantum photonics.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement fidelity limits of photonically-networked atomic qubits from recoil and timing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichao Yu, Sagnik Saha, Mikhail Shalaev, George Toh, Jameson OReilly, Isabella Goetting, Ashish Kalakuntla, Christopher Monroe</p>
            <p>The remote entanglement of two atomic quantum memories through photonic interactions is accompanied by atomic momentum recoil. When the interactions occur at different times, such as from the random emission over the lifetime of the atomic excited state, the difference in recoil timing can expose ``which-path'' information and ultimately lead to decoherence. Time-bin encoded photonic qubits can be particularly sensitive to asynchronous recoil timing. In this paper we study the limits of entanglement fidelity in atomic systems due to recoil and other timing imbalances and show how these effects can be suppressed or even eliminated through proper experimental design.</p>

            <p>Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs.</p>

Singular Hilbert spaces are widely used in scenarios where some discretization of the space (or spacetime) is considered, e.g., loop quantum gravity, loop quantum cosmology and polymer quantum mechanics.

            <p>We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.</p>

            <p>Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</p>

            <p>Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.</p>

Focusing on the 1D scenario of a string of particles, we develop an optimal protocol for quantum edge detection, efficiently computing its success probability through Schur-Weyl duality and semidefinite programming techniques. We analyze the behavior of the success probability as a function of the string length and local dimension, with emphasis in the limit of long strings. We present a protocol based on square root measurement, which proves asymptotically optimal. Additionally, we explore a mixed quantum change point detection scenario where the state of particles transitions from known to unknown, which may find practical applications in detecting malfunctions in quantum devices</p>

            <p>Realizing efficient and controlled state transfer is necessary for implementing a wide range of classical and quantum information protocols. Recent studies have demonstrated that both asymmetric and symmetric state transfer can be achieved by encircling an exceptional point (EP) in non-Hermitian (NH) systems. However, the application of this phenomenon has been restricted to scenarios where an EP exists in single-qubit systems and is associated with a specific type of dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate efficient and controlled symmetric and asymmetric Bell-state transfers by modulating system parameters within a Jaynes-Cummings model while accounting for atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay. The effective suppression of nonadiabatic transitions enables a symmetric exchange of Bell states irrespective of the encircling direction. Furthermore, we report a counterintuitive finding: the presence of an EP is not indispensable for implementing asymmetric state transfers in NH systems. We achieve perfect asymmetric Bell-state transfers even in the absence of an EP, by dynamically orbiting around an approximate EP. Our work presents an approach to effectively and reliably manipulate entangled states with both symmetric and asymmetric characteristics, through the dissipation engineering in NH systems.</p>

            <p>The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</p>

            <p>Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.</p>

            <p>Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling.

            <p>Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum graph states are critical resources for various quantum algorithms, and also determine essential interconnections in distributed quantum computing. There are two schemes for generating graph states probabilistic scheme and deterministic scheme. While the all-photonic probabilistic scheme has garnered significant attention, the emitter-photonic deterministic scheme has been proved to be more scalable and feasible across several hardware platforms. This paper studies the GraphState-to-Circuit compilation problem in the context of the deterministic scheme. Previous research has primarily focused on optimizing individual circuit parameters, often neglecting the characteristics of quantum hardware, which results in impractical implementations. Additionally, existing algorithms lack scalability for larger graph sizes. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel compilation framework that partitions the target graph state into subgraphs, compiles them individually, and subsequently combines and schedules the circuits to maximize emitter resource utilization. Furthermore, we incorporate local complementation to transform graph states and minimize entanglement overhead. Evaluation of our framework on various graph types demonstrates significant reductions in CNOT gates and circuit duration, up to 52% and 56%. Moreover, it enhances the suppression of photon loss, achieving improvements of up to x1.9.</p>

In comparison to the previously studied inverted $\Xi$ system, this system has a good signal-to-noise ratio even at room temperature with similar linewidth (around $10$~MHz). We also observe Autler-Towns splitting of the EIT due to the high power of probe and blue control lasers. For completeness and comparison, we also study the EIT in an inverted $\Xi$ system using $5S_{1/2}\rightarrow6P_{1/2}\rightarrow 69D_{3/2}$ transitions.</p>

            <p>Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) elevates the secure key rate from a linear to a square-root dependence on channel loss while preserving measurement-device-independent security. This protocol is uniquely positioned to enable global-scale quantum networks, even under extreme channel loss. While fiber-based TF-QKD implementations have advanced rapidly since its proposal, free-space realizations have remained elusive due to atmospheric turbulence-induced phase distortions. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of free-space TF-QKD over 14.2 km urban atmospheric channels, surpassing the effective atmospheric thickness -- a critical threshold for satellite compatibility. We achieve a secret key rate exceeding the repeaterless capacity bound, a milestone for practical quantum communication. Our approach eliminates the need for an auxiliary channel to stabilize a closed interferometer, instead leveraging open-channel time and phase control of optical pulses.

            <p>Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly-polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. We verify our predicted complementary response in rubidium vapour cell experiments and through density matrix calculations. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic polarimetry for quantum metrological electric field characterization.</p>

            <p>In order to solve problems of practical importance, quantum computers will likely need to incorporate quantum error correction, where a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits. The large physical-qubit overhead typically associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches. Here, using a microfabricated superconducting quantum circuit, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance $d=5$. The bosonic cat qubits are passively protected against bit flips using a stabilizing circuit. Cat-qubit phase-flip errors are corrected by the repetition code which uses ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement. We realize a noise-biased CX gate which ensures bit-flip error suppression is maintained during error correction. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below threshold, with logical phase-flip error decreasing with code distance from $d=3$ to $d=5$. Concurrently, the logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat-qubit mean photon number. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average $1.75(2)\%$ for the distance-3 code sections, and $1.65(3)\%$ for the longer distance-5 code, demonstrating the effectiveness of bit-flip error suppression throughout the error correction cycle. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings allows us to use a hardware-efficient outer error correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes are a compelling paradigm for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Li Calsi, Sumit Chaudhary, JinHyeock Choi, Marc Geitz, Janis Nötzel</p>
            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are infamously known for their high demand on hardware, their extremely low key generation rates and their lack of security resulting from a need for trusted nodes which is implied by the absence of quantum repeaters. While they theoretically offer unlimited security, they are therefore practically limited in several regards. In this work we focus on the lack of options to guarantee an end-to-end security service with the currently available technology and infrastructure and propose a novel protocol. We find that one of the stumbling stones on the path towards an end-to-end security service guaranteed by quantum key distribution may be removed by using this protocol. Our proposal combines several parallel instances of twinfield QKD followed by classical postprocessing and communication to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret key. This hybrid approach improves the key rate and range w.r.t. to previous QKD approaches at a contained cost in security. We show that a coalition of intermediary nodes between Alice and Bob is needed to break the new scheme, sharply outperforming the trusted node approach in terms of security. Furthermore, the protocols do not require complex quantum measurements on Alice and Bob's sides, thus being truly end-to-end.</p>

            <h2>Instrumental distortions in quantum optimal control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uluk Rasulov, Ilya Kuprov</p>
            <p>Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual jumble of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, amplifiers, and filters can and would distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next, and across the sample. Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering (RAW-GRAPE) framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions within the GRAPE optimisation loop, does not require filter function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles. The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Parameter Estimation for Detectors in Constantly Accelerated Motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Wang, Jialin Zhang, Hongwei Yu</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum parameter estimation by analyzing the dynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the state parameters of accelerated detectors undergoing four different acceleration scenarios: linear, cusped, catenary, and circular motions. Our results show that QFI for the acceleration parameter converges to a nonnegative asymptotic value over long evolution times, with this value strongly dependent on the specific acceleration scenario. In contrast, QFI for the weight parameter degrades to zero over time. Notably, for sufficiently large accelerations, optimal precision in estimating the acceleration parameter can be achieved within a finite evolution time rather than requiring an infinitely long measurement duration. Comparing different scenarios, we find that for small accelerations relative to the detector's energy gap, linear motion provides the most accurate estimation of the weight parameter, introducing the least noise among all scenarios. However, for large accelerations, circular motion becomes the optimal scenario for estimating the weight parameter. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the estimation of the acceleration parameter, where circular motion is optimal both for small accelerations and for large accelerations over extremely long evolution times. These distinctions in QFI may provide a new tool for identifying the specific acceleration scenario of an accelerated detector.</p>

            <h2>Correlation versus dissipation in a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Masaya Nakagawa, Norio Kawakami</p>
            <p>We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</p>

            <h2>Emission photon statistics in collectively interacting dipole atom arrays in the low-intensity limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepak A. Suresh, F. Robicheaux</p>
            <p>We investigate the photon statistics of light emitted from a system of collectively interacting dipoles in the low-intensity regime, incorporating double-excitation states to capture beyond-single-excitation effects. By analyzing the eigenstates of the double-excitation manifold, we establish their connection to the accessible single-excitation eigenmodes and investigate the role of decay rates in shaping the initial-time photon correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau = 0)$ under different detection schemes. By interfering two beams of light that selectively address orthogonal eigenmodes, the photon emission statistics can be arbitrarily controlled. This can act as a tunable nonlinearity that enables both the enhancement and suppression of photon correlations, extending the operational intensity range for single-photon applications.</p>

            <h2>Recoil-induced errors and their correction in photon-mediated entanglement between atom qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Apolín, David P. Nadlinger</p>
            <p>Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of atom-field interaction inside a nonlinear Kerr-like medium filled optical cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naveen Kumar, Arpita Chatterjee</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of two two-level atoms interacting with a two-mode field inside an optical cavity, in presence of a nonlinear Kerr-like medium as well as the Stark shift. We derive the exact analytical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation that provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the system's quantum properties. To characterize the nonclassical features of the radiation field, we examine photon number distribution, second-order correlation function $g^2(0)$, squeezing properties, and Mandel's $Q_M$ parameter. These properties reveal significant insights into the quantum statistical behaviour of the field and its deviation from classicality under different interaction regimes. In addition, we quantify the atom-atom entanglement using linear entropy which captures the mixedness of the atomic subsystem and elucidates the interplay between atom-atom interactions. The results highlight the crucial role of nonlinear interactions and the Stark shift in shaping the quantum correlations and nonclassical phenomena of the system.</p>

            <h2>Controllable Single Photon Scattering via Coupling of Driven $Λ$ System with Topological Waveguide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gunjan Yadav, Madan Mohan Mahana, Tarak Nath Dey</p>
            <p>We investigate the coherent single photon scattering process in a topological waveguide coupled with a driven $\Lambda$ system. We derive an analytical expression for transmittance by using the scattering formalism for three different sublattice sites (A, B, and AB), which couples to the $\Lambda$ system. We have demonstrated that the system's response is topology-independent for A and B sublattice-site coupling and becomes topology-dependent for AB sublattice-site coupling. In a weak control field regime, the system behaves as a perfect mirror in all of these configurations. Upon the control field strength enhancement, the transmission spectrum evolves from Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) to Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) in A and B sublattice-site coupling. The manipulation of transmission from opaque to transparent holds the key mechanism of a single photon switch. Further, the topology-dependent AB sublattice configuration allows the sharper Fano line shape that is absent in topology-independent A and B sublattice configurations. This characteristic of the Fano line can be used as a tunable single-photon switch and for sensing external perturbations. Furthermore, our study paves the way for the robustness and tunability of systems with applications in quantum technologies such as quantum switches, sensors, and communication devices.</p>

            <h2>Dual-type dual-element atom arrays for quantum information processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanchuan Zhang, Jeth Arunseangroj, Wenchao Xu</p>
            <p>Neutral-atom arrays are a leading platform for quantum technologies, offering a promising route toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing. We propose a novel quantum processing architecture based on dual-type, dual-element atom arrays, where individually trapped atoms serve as data qubits, and small atomic ensembles enable ancillary operations. By leveraging the selective initialization, coherent control, and collective optical response of atomic ensembles, we demonstrate ensemble-assisted quantum operations that enable reconfigurable, high-speed control of individual data qubits and rapid mid-circuit readout, including both projective single-qubit and joint multi-qubit measurements. The hybrid approach of this architecture combines the long coherence times of single-atom qubits with the enhanced controllability of atomic ensembles, achieving high-fidelity state manipulation and detection with minimal crosstalk. Numerical simulations indicate that our scheme supports individually addressable single- and multi-qubit operations with fidelities of 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively, as well as fast single- and multi-qubit state readout with fidelities exceeding 99% within tens of microseconds. These capabilities open new pathways toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling repetitive error syndrome detection and efficient generation of long-range entangled many-body states, thereby expanding the quantum information toolbox beyond existing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Near-field dynamical Casimir effect</h2>

            <p>We propose the dynamical Casimir effect in a time-modulated near-field system at finite temperatures. The system consists of two bodies made of polaritonic materials, that are brought in close proximity to each other, and the modulation frequency is approximately twice the relevant resonance frequencies of the system. We develop a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics formalism to explore the produced Casimir flux, associated with the degenerate as well as non-degenerate two-polariton emission processes. We have identified flux contributions from both quantum and thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures, with a dominant quantum contribution even at room temperature under the presence of a strong near-field effect. We have found that the Casimir flux can be generated with a smaller modulation frequency through higher-order dynamical Casimir effect. We have conducted a nonclassicality test for the total radiative flux at finite temperatures, and shown that nonclassical states of emitted photons can be obtained for a high temperature up to $\sim 250\,$K. Our findings open an avenue for the exploration of dynamical Casimir effect beyond cryogenic temperatures, and may be useful for creating tunable nanoscale nonclassical thermal states.</p>

            <p>The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>A dual-operation mode SNSPD is proposed. In the conventional Geiger mode, the sensor operates at temperatures well below the critical temperature, Tc, working as an event counter without sensitivity to the number of photons impinging the sensor. In the calorimetric mode, the detector is operated at temperatures just below TC and displays calorimetric sensitivity in the range of 15 to 250 absorbed-photon energy equivalent for a photon beam with a wavelength of 515 nm. In this energy sensitive mode, photon absorption causes Joule heating of the SNSPD that becomes partially resistive without the presence of latching. Depending on the application, by tuning the sample temperature and bias current using the same readout system, the SNSPD can readily switch between the two modes. In the calorimetric mode, SNSPD recovery times shorter than the ones in the Geiger mode are observed, reaching values as low as 560 ps. Dual-mode SNSPDs may provide significant advancements in spectroscopy and calorimetry, where precise timing, photon counting and energy resolution are required.</p>

            <p>We study the control problem of regulating the purity of a quantum harmonic oscillator in a Gaussian state via weak measurements. Specifically, we assume time-invariant Hamiltonian dynamics and that control is exerted via the back-action induced from monitoring the oscillator's position and momentum observables; the manipulation of the detector measurement strengths regulates the purity of the target Gaussian quantum state. After briefly drawing connections between Gaussian quantum dynamics and stochastic control, we focus on the effect of inefficient detectors and derive closed-form expressions for the transient and steady-state dynamics of the state covariance. We highlight the degradation of attainable purity that is due to inefficient detectors, as compared to that dictated by the Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty relation. Our results suggest that quantum correlations can enhance the purity at steady-state. The quantum harmonic oscillator represents a basic system where analytic formulae may provide insights into the role of inefficient measurements in quantum control; the gained insights are pertinent to measurement-based quantum engines and cooling experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Saugbjerg Lange, Thomas Hansen, Lars Bojer Madsen</p>
            <p>The strong-field induced generation of nonclassical states of light is not only a subject of fundamental research but also has potential usage in quantum information science and technology. The emerging field of strong-field quantum optics has developed ways of generating nonclassical states of light from the process of high-harmonic generation (HHG) at much wider frequency ranges and intensities than is typical for quantum optics. So far, however, no clear nonclassical signal at a distinct and unambiguous frequency has been predicted. Here, we study the response from an exciton in a Mott-insulating system, using the extended Hubbard model. We find that the exciton plays a key role in the nonclassical response and generates squeezing at the exciton energy. We relate this nonclassical response to the nonvanishing time correlations of the current operator in the system. Our work defines a direction for experimental work to search for squeezed light from HHG in a spectrally confined region defined by the exciton energy.</p>

            <p>Recent years have witnessed a surge of experimental and theoretical interest in controlling the properties of matter, such as its chemical reactivity, by confining it in optical cavities, where the enhancement of the light-matter coupling strength leads to the creation of hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. However, ab initio calculations that account for the quantum nature of both the electromagnetic field and matter are challenging and have only started to be developed in recent years. We introduce a deep learning variational quantum Monte Carlo method to solve the electronic and photonic Schrödinger equation of molecules trapped in optical cavities. We extend typical electronic neural network wavefunction ansatzes to describe joint fermionic and bosonic systems, i.e. electron-photon systems, in a quantum Monte Carlo framework. We apply our method to hydrogen molecules in a cavity, computing both ground and excited states. We assess their energy, dipole moment, charge density shift due to the cavity, the state of the photonic field, and the entanglement developed between the electrons and photons. When possible, we compare our results with more conventional quantum chemistry methods proposed in the literature, finding good qualitative agreement, thus extending the range of scientific problems that can be tackled using machine learning techniques.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology offers the potential to surpass its classical counterpart, pushing the boundaries of measurement precision toward the ultimate Heisenberg limit. This enhanced precision is normally attained by utilizing large squeezed states or multi-particle entangled quantum states, both of which are often challenging to implement and prone to decoherence in real quantum devices. In this work, we present a versatile and on-demand protocol for deterministic parameter estimation that leverages two efficient state-transfer operations on a single bosonic mode. Specifically, we demonstrate this protocol in the context of phase estimation using the superposition of coherent states in the bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low average photon numbers of only up to 1.76, we achieve quantum-enhanced precision approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB. Importantly, we show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further enhanced on the fly by tailoring the input states, with different superposition weights, based on specific system constraints. The realization of this versatile and efficient scheme affords a promising path towards practical quantum-enhanced sensing, not only for bosonic cQED hardware but also readily extensible to other continuous-variable platforms.</p>

We derive a master equation from the microscopic model, and we explore key thermodynamic quantities, such as work, heat, and entropy production. Our results reveal that the DTC signature inevitably decays in the presence of environmental noise, but we show that a periodic measurement scheme can mitigate the effects of decoherence, stabilizing the subharmonic oscillations of the DTC for extended periods.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</p>

Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.</p>

            <h2>Optimal and efficient qubit routing for quantum simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joris Kattemölle, Guido Burkard</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation promises new discoveries in physics, yet on most platforms its progress is limited by device connectivity constraints. Although SWAP gates can be inserted, their use increases circuit depth, which cannot be tolerated on current quantum computers and increases computational cost on fault-tolerant devices. Therefore, minimizing SWAP overhead is crucial, which, however, leads to a computational problem that is itself intractable. We establish a framework for analyzing spatiotemporally periodic circuits, which naturally occur in the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems and lattice gauge theories. We introduce and implement a method that leverages this framework to efficiently minimize SWAP overhead. It has a significant scaling advantage, outperforming leading general-purpose approaches by several orders of magnitude even for moderate system sizes. Remarkably, we find solutions with no SWAP overhead, opening the door for current quantum computers to explore geometrically frustrated magnetism.</p>

            <p>Electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a promising system for micro- and nano-scale magnetic sensing, due to their operation under ambient conditions, ease of placement in close proximity to sensing targets, and biological compatibility. At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits but can also potentially enhance sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room temperature quantum sensor. Our approach utilizes time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering in a two-dimensional ensemble of NV centers. Strikingly, we observe that the optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opening the door towards entanglement-enhanced practical quantum sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme B. Xavier, Jan-Åke Larsson, Paolo Villoresi, Giuseppe Vallone, Adán Cabello</p>
            <p>Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.</p>

Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have emerged as a crucial enabling technology for these systems, integrating quantum memories with efficient electrical and optical interfaces in a compact and scalable platform. Packaging these hybrid chips into deployable modules while maintaining low optical loss and resiliency to temperature cycling is a central challenge to their practical use. We demonstrate a packaging method for PICs using surface grating couplers and angle-polished fiber arrays that is robust to temperature cycling, offers scalable channel count, applies to a wide variety of PIC platforms and wavelengths, and offers pathways to automated high-throughput packaging. Using this method, we show optically and electrically packaged quantum memory modules integrating all required qubit controls on chip, operating at millikelvin temperatures with < 3dB losses achievable from fiber to quantum memory.</p>

            <p>We consider problems of distributing high-fidelity entangled states across nodes of a quantum network. We consider a repeater-based network architecture with entanglement swapping (fusion) operations for generating long-distance entanglements, and purification operations that produce high-fidelity states from several lower-fidelity states. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, while there have been several works on fidelity-aware routing and incorporating purification into routing for generating EPs, this paper presents the first algorithms for optimal solutions to the high-fidelity EP distribution problem. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm for generating the optimal tree of operations to produce a high-fidelity EP, and an LP-based algorithm for generating an optimal collection of trees. Second, following the EP algorithms, this paper presents the first algorithms for the high-fidelity GHZ-state distribution problem and characterizes its optimality. We evaluate our techniques via simulations over NetSquid, a quantum network simulator.</p>

            <p>The role of polarization in the topology of quantum emitter chains is investigated theoretically, whereby "polarization" refers to the transition dipole moments of the emitters. We show that, if the chain is zigzag-shaped, different topological phases can be realized by adjusting the polarization direction. It turns out that long-range dipole-dipole couplings weaken the bulk-boundary correspondence, but on the other hand give rise to higher-order topological phases with four observable edge modes. We also demonstrate how the polarization orientation can be used to define an additional dimension and simulate a synthetic Chern insulator. Our findings open up a way to actively switch between various topological phases within a single arrangement of quantum emitters.</p>

            <p>Dissipative light-matter coupling plays a vital role in non-Hermitian physics, but it remains largely unexplored in waveguide QED systems. In this work, we find that by employing pseudo-Hermitian symmetry rather than anti-PT symmetry, the concept of dissipative coupling could be generalized and applied to the field of waveguide QED. This leads to a series of intriguing results, such as spontaneous breaking of pseudo-Hermitian symmetry across the exceptional points (EPs), level attraction between the bound states, and critical transition across the EPs for the population of quantum emitters in the bound state. Thanks to the tunability of photonic bands in crystal waveguides, we also demonstrate that dissipative light-matter coupling leads to the emergence of nonstandard third-order exceptional points with chiral spatial profiles in a topological waveguide QED system. This work provides a promising paradigm for studying non-Hermitian quantum phenomena in waveguide QED systems.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of polarizable particles coupled to a lossy cavity mode that are transversally driven by a laser. Our analysis is performed in the regime where the cavity linewidth exceeds the recoil frequency by several orders of magnitude. Using a two-stage cooling protocol we show that the particles' kinetic energy can be reduced down to the recoil energy. This cooling protocol relies in its first stage on a high laser power such that the particles cool into a strongly self-organized pattern. This can be seen as a strongly magnetized state. In a second stage we adiabatically ramp down the laser intensity such that the particles' kinetic energy is transferred to their potential energy and the particles are ``demagnetized''. In this second stage we optimize the ramping speed which needs to be fast enough to avoid unwanted heating and slow enough such that the dynamics remains to good approximation adiabatic.</p>

            <p>In this work, we utilize a two-level atom and a ${\Lambda}$-type atom to link two identical waveguides, subsequently extending the model to a giant-atom configuration. Our analytical solutions and numerical simulations demonstrate that this setup can achieve single-photon isolation and nonreciprocal frequency conversion by tuning the atom-waveguide coupling strengths $g_i$, respectively. We also examine single-photon scattering in the giant-atom model within both the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The results reveal that ultranarrow scattering windows are induced by the phases ${\phi}_1$ and ${\phi}_2$ under specific conditions, making them well-suited for precise frequency conversion and sensing. Additionally, in the non-Markovian regime, the spectra exhibit irregular polygonal shapes, offering enhanced opportunities for exploring nonreciprocal frequency conversion in the off-resonant regime. Our work provides a new perspective on achieving optical nonreciprocity at the single-photon level in atom-waveguide systems.</p>

            <p>Multi-armed bandits are one of the theoretical pillars of reinforcement learning. Recently, the investigation of quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems was started, and it was found that a quadratic speed-up (in query complexity) is possible when the arms and the randomness of the rewards of the arms can be queried in superposition. Here we introduce further bandit models where we only have limited access to the randomness of the rewards, but we can still query the arms in superposition. We show that then the query complexity is the same as for classical algorithms. This generalizes the prior result that no speed-up is possible for unstructured search when the oracle has positive failure probability.</p>

            <p>In the classical regime, thermodynamic state transformations are governed by the free energy. This is also called as the second law of thermodynamics. Previous works showed that, access to a catalytic system allows us to restore the second law in the quantum regime when we ignore coherence. However, in the quantum regime, coherence and free energy are two independent resources. Therefore, coherence places additional non-trivial restrictions on the the state transformations, that remains elusive. In order to close this gap, we isolate and study the nature of coherence, i.e., we assume access to a source of free energy. We show that allowing catalysis along with a source of free energy allows us to amplify any quantum coherence present in the quantum state arbitrarily. Additionally, any correlations between the system and the catalyst can be suppressed arbitrarily. Therefore, our results provide a key step in formulating a fully general law of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leigh Lapworth, Christoph Sünderhauf</p>
            <p>Quantum linear system solvers like the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) require a block encoding of the system matrix $A$ within a unitary operator $U_A$. Unfortunately, block encoding often results in significant subnormalisation and increase in the matrix's effective condition number $\kappa$, affecting the efficiency of solvers. Matrix preconditioning is a well-established classical technique to reduce $\kappa$ by multiplying $A$ by a preconditioner $P$. Here, we study quantum preconditioning for block encodings. We consider four preconditioners and two encoding approaches: (a) separately encoding $A$ and its preconditioner $P$, followed by quantum multiplication, and (b) classically multiplying $A$ and $P$ before encoding the product in $U_{PA}$. Their impact on subnormalisation factors and condition number $\kappa$ are analysed using practical matrices from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Our results show that (a) quantum multiplication introduces excessive subnormalisation factors, negating improvements in $\kappa$. We introduce preamplified quantum multiplication to reduce subnormalisation, which is of independent interest. Conversely, we see that (b) encoding of the classical product can significantly improve the effective condition number using the Sparse Approximate Inverse preconditioner with infill. Further, we introduce a new matrix filtering technique that reduces the circuit depth without adversely affecting the matrix solution. We apply these methods to reduce the number of QSVT phase factors by a factor of 25 for an example CFD matrix of size 1024x1024.</p>

Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.</p>

            <p>We present a general theory of gain-modified emission dynamics between two quantum emitters (two level systems) in a linear gain medium, demonstrating how gain modifies the usual radiative decay rates and inter-emitter coupling and decay rates, that are well known from purely lossy systems. We derive a Born-Markov master equation that shows explicitly how gain modifies the usual rates appearing for two emitters in a loss only medium, and introduces new gain terms. We then present Bloch equations in the bare state basis as well as a dressed-state basis (using superradiant and subradiant states). As an application of the theory, we show calculations for a fully three-dimensional metal dimer in a gain-compensated medium, containing two quantum emitters, and show explicit solutions in terms of the quasinormal modes, which easily allows one to obtain all the relevant decay rates. We study the modified decay dynamics, gain excited pumping, as well as the entanglement entropy and spectral emission. We also demonstrate how a breakdown of the weak excitation approximation in the presence of gain requires a careful treatment beyond a linear response, which yields non-trivial incoherent coupling terms that typically are not included in dipole-dipole coupling models or heuristic gain pumping models.</p>

By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed.

However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems.

In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</p>

            <p>Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel quantum algorithm that is able to classify a hierarchy of classes of imbalanced Boolean functions. The fundamental characteristic of imbalanced Boolean functions is that the proportion of elements in their domain that take the value $0$ is not equal to the proportion of elements that take the value $1$. For every positive integer $n$, the hierarchy contains a class of Boolean functions defined based on their behavioral pattern. The common trait of all the functions belonging to the same class is that they possess the same imbalance ratio. Our algorithm achieves classification in a straightforward manner as the final measurement reveals the unknown function with probability $1$. Let us also note that the proposed algorithm is an optimal oracular algorithm because it can classify the aforementioned functions with a single query to the oracle. At the same time we explain in detail the methodology we followed to design this algorithm in the hope that it will prove general and fruitful, given that it can be easily modified and extended to address other classes of imbalanced Boolean functions that exhibit different behavioral patterns.</p>

            <p>Over the last decades, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has risen as a promising solution for secure communications. However, like all cryptographic protocols, QKD implementations can open security vulnerabilities. Until now, the study of physical vulnerabilities in QKD setups has primarily focused on the optical channel. In classical cryptoanalysis, power and electromagnetic side-channel analysis are powerful techniques used to access unwanted information about the encryption key in symmetric-key algorithms. In QKD they have rarely been used, since they require an eavesdropper to have access to Alice or Bob's setups. However, security proofs of QKD protocols generally assume that these setups are secure, making it crucial to understand the necessary security measures to ensure this protection. In this work, we propose and implement a power side-channel analysis to a QKD system, by exploiting the power consumption of the electronic driver controlling the electro-optical components of the QKD transmitter. QKD modules typically require very precise electronic drivers, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Here, we show that the FPGA's power consumption can leak information about the QKD operation, and consequently the transmitted key. The analysis was performed on the QKD transmitter at the University of Padua. Our results are consistent and show critical information leakage, having reached a maximum accuracy of 73.35% in predicting transmitted qubits at a 100 MHz repetition frequency.</p>

Here, we show that the measurement outcomes, recorded during monitored dynamics, can provide crucial information about the properties of the monitored dynamical system itself.

Through an unsupervised learning and mutual information analysis on the classical dataset of measurement outcomes, we find that the information loss in the system, reflected by the increased entanglement, is compensated by an emergent structure in this classical dataset. Our findings highlight the crucial role of measurements and corresponding classical outcomes in capturing prethermal nonergodicity, offering a promising perspective for applications to other monitored quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Noise-strength-adapted approximate quantum codes inspired by machine learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuwei Liu, Shiyu Zhou, Zi-Wen Liu, Jinmin Yi</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that machine learning provides a powerful tool for discovering new approximate quantum error-correcting (AQEC) codes beyond conventional algebraic frameworks. Building upon results from hybrid quantum-classical learning, we construct two novel types of noise-strength-adapted (NSA) AQEC codes, namely a self-complementary code and a pair-complementary code, which can outperform conventional codes for amplitude damping (AD) noise. The 4-qubit self-complementary NSA code outperforms its non-NSA counterpart in fidelity and Knill-Laflamme condition violation. The pair-complementary code, which has no known non-NSA analog, achieves even better performance with higher-order loss suppression and better fidelity. We further generalize both approaches to families of NSA AD codes of arbitrary system size, as well as an NSA variant of the 0-2-4 binomial code for single-photon loss. Our results demonstrate that adaptation to noise strength can lead to significant improvements in error correction capability, and highlight how machine learning can help discover new valuable codes that may be missed through conventional algebraic approaches.</p>

            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich phase diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.</p>

Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.</p>

            <p>Advancing error-corrected quantum computing and fundamental science necessitates quantum-limited amplifiers with near-ideal quantum efficiency and multiplexing capability. However, existing solutions achieve one at the expense of the other. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first Floquet-mode traveling-wave parametric amplifier (Floquet TWPA). Fabricated in a superconducting-qubit process, our Floquet TWPA achieves minimal dissipation, quantum-limited noise performance, and broadband operation. Our device exhibits $>20$-dB amplification over a $3$-GHz instantaneous bandwidth, $<\!0.5$-dB average in-band insertion loss, and the highest-reported intrinsic quantum efficiency for a TWPA of $92.1\pm7.6\%$, relative to an ideal phase-preserving amplifier. When measuring a superconducting qubit, our Floquet TWPA enables a system measurement efficiency of $65.1\pm5.8\%$, the highest-reported in a superconducting qubit readout experiment utilizing phase-preserving amplifiers to the best of our knowledge. These general-purpose Floquet TWPAs are suitable for fast, high-fidelity multiplexed readout in large-scale quantum systems and future monolithic integration with quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</p>

Furthermore, we characterize two-photon interference via Hong-Ou-Mandel measurements and achieve a photon indistinguishability of $94.6\,\%$ with a temporal postselection of 100 ps time window and $5.58\,\%$ without temporal postselection. We measure a first-lens source efficiency of $\sim28\,\%$.

In the quantum case, this system has an exact steady state and the limit cycle appears in conditional quantum dynamics under homodyne detection. We show that the intrinsic quantum phase diffusion on the limit cycle leads to fluctuations in the period. By simulating the stochastic master equation for homodyne detection, we extract the statistical properties of the clock period. We show that the precision of the clock satisfies the quantum-thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty relations. As energy dissipation increases, the clock quality improves, fully validating, in a quantum stochastic system, the link between energy dissipation and clock precision.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sutapa Ghosh, Alexey Gorlach, Chen Mechel, Maria V. Chekhova, Ido Kaminer, Gadi Eisenstein</p>
            <p>Strong optical nonlinearities are key to a range of technologies, particularly in the generation of photonic quantum states. The strongest nonlinearity in hot atomic vapors originates from electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which, while effective, often lacks tunability and suffers from significant losses due to atomic absorption. We propose and demonstrate an N-level EIT scheme, created by an optical frequency comb that excites a warm rubidium vapor. The massive number of comb lines simultaneously drive numerous transitions that interfere constructively to induce a giant and highly tunable cross-Kerr optical nonlinearity. The obtained third-order nonlinearity values range from $1.2 \times 10^{-7}$ to $7.7 \times 10^{-7}$ $m^2 V^{-2}$. Above and beyond that, the collective N-level interference can be optimized by phase shaping the comb lines using a spectral phase mask. Each nonlinearity value can then be tuned over a wide range, from 40\% to 250\% of the initial strength. We utilize the nonlinearity to demonstrate squeezing by self polarization rotation of CW signals that co-propagate with the pump and are tuned to one of the EIT transparent regions. Homodyne measurements reveal a quadrature squeezing level of 3.5 dB at a detuning of 640 MHz. When tuned closer to an atomic resonance, the nonlinearity is significantly enhanced while maintaining low losses, resulting in the generation of non-Gaussian cubic phase states. These states exhibit negative regions in their Wigner functions, a hallmark of quantum behavior. Consequently, N-level EIT enables the direct generation of photonic quantum states without requiring postselection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Cupo, Shuanglong Liu, Silas Hoffman, X.-G. Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng</p>
            <p>We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total spin of the metal center. By focusing on an $S = 1$ electronic spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate significant continuous tunability of the low-lying energy levels. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, all three energy levels retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field so that any pair of renormalized energy levels forms a clock transition qubit. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further physical insights are obtained from an effective Hamiltonian, derived analytically from second order van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.</p>

            <p>Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QPINNs) integrate quantum computing and machine learning to impose physical biases on the output of a quantum neural network, aiming to either solve or discover differential equations. The approach has recently been implemented on both the gate model and continuous variable quantum computing architecture, where it has been demonstrated capable of solving ordinary differential equations. Here, we aim to extend the method to effectively address a wider range of equations, such as the Poisson equation and the heat equation. To achieve this goal, we introduce an architecture specifically designed to compute second-order (and higher-order) derivatives without relying on nested automatic differentiation methods. This approach mitigates the unwanted side effects associated with nested gradients in simulations, paving the way for more efficient and accurate implementations. By leveraging such an approach, the quantum circuit addresses partial differential equations -- a challenge not yet tackled using this approach on continuous-variable quantum computers. As a proof-of-concept, we solve a one-dimensional instance of the heat equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling PDEs. Such a framework paves the way for further developments in continuous-variable quantum computing and underscores its potential contributions to advancing quantum machine learning.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits have been used in the most advanced demonstrations of quantum information processing, and they can be manufactured at-scale using proven semiconductor techniques. This makes them one of the leading technologies in the race to demonstrate useful quantum computers. Since their initial demonstration, advances in design, fabrication, and materials have extended the timescales over which fragile quantum information can be stored and manipulated on superconducting qubits. Ubiquitous atomic-scale material defects have been identified as a primary cause of qubit energy-loss and decoherence. Here we study transmon qubits that exhibit energy relaxation times exceeding 2.5 ms. Even at these long timescales, our qubit energy loss is dominated by two level systems (TLS). We observe large variations in these energy-loss times that would make it extremely difficult to accurately evaluate and compare qubit fabrication processes and to perform studies that require precise measurements of energy loss. To address this issue, we present a technique for characterizing qubit quality factor. In this method, we apply a slowly varying electric field to TLS near the qubit to stabilize the measured energy relaxation time, enabling us to replace hundreds of hours of measurements with ones that span several minutes.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional integration technologies such as flip-chip bonding are a key prerequisite to realize large-scale superconducting quantum processors. Modular architectures, in which circuit elements are spread over multiple chips, can further improve scalability and performance by enabling the integration of elements with different substrates or fabrication processes, by increasing the fabrication yield of completed devices, and by physically separating the qubits onto distinct modules to avoid correlated errors mediated by a common substrate. We present a design for a multi-chip module comprising one carrier chip and four qubit modules. Measuring two of the qubits, we analyze the readout performance, finding a mean three-level state-assignment error of $9 \times 10^{-3}$ in 200 ns. We calibrate single-qubit gates and measure a mean simultaneous randomized benchmarking error of $6 \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with the coherence times of the qubits. Using a wiring-efficient static inter-module coupler featuring galvanic inter-chip transitions, we demonstrate a controlled-Z two-qubit gate in 100 ns with an error of $7 \times 10^{-3}$ extracted from interleaved randomized benchmarking. Three-dimensional integration, as presented here, will continue to contribute to improving the performance of gates and readout as well as increasing the qubit count in future superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We discover a new class of Gaussian bound entangled states of four-mode continuous-variable systems. These states appear as a transient phase when certain NPT-entangled Gaussian states are evolved under a noisy environment. A thermal bath comprising of harmonic oscillators is allowed to interact with one or modes of the system and a wide variety of initial Gaussian entangled (NPT as well as PPT) states are studied. The robustness of entanglement is defined as the time duration for which the entanglement of the initial state is preserved under the noisy dynamics. We access the separability by utilizing standard semi-definite programming techniques. While most states lose their entanglement after a certain time across all bi-partitions, an exception is observed for a three-parameter family of states which we call the generalized four-mode squeezed vacuum (gFMSV) states, which transitions to a bound entangled state, and remains so for a finite window of time. This dynamical onset of bound entanglement in continuous-variable systems is the central observation of our work. We carry out the analysis for Haar-random four-mode states (both pure and mixed) to scan the state space for transient bound entangled phase</p>

            <h2>Efficient noise tailoring and detection of hypergraph states using Clifford circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guedong Park, Jinzhao Sun, Hyunseok Jeong</p>
            <p>Hypergraph states are important magic resources for realizing universal quantum computation and diverse non-local physical phenomena. However, noise detection for such states is challenging due to their large dimension and entanglement. This work proposes an efficient Clifford circuit-based scheme for tailoring and detecting noise in third-ordered hypergraph states generated by CCZ, CZ, and Z gates. The core part of our scheme is converting the noisy input state into a diagonal form and obtaining the convolution equation of noise rate via Clifford circuits. The depth of the Clifford circuit can be reduced to a constant, depending on the structure of the hypergraph state. After that, we decode it using the fast Hadamard-Walsh transform or some approximation method. The approximation with respect to the $l_2$-norm can be done efficiently by the number of qubits while keeping sufficient precision. Furthermore, the sparse noise assumption, which frequently holds in current experimental setups, enables $ l_1$ approximation. Compared with state verification methods, our method allows us to attain richer information on noise rates and apply various noise-adapted error correction and mitigation methods. Moreover, it bridges the connection between the convolution equation's nonlinearity and the Clifford hierarchy of the hypergraph state inputs. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the nature of highly entangled systems and drive the interests of the research venues concerning magic state implementation.</p>

            <p>$\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used in fields ranging from chemistry, material science to neuroscience. Nanoscale NMR spectroscopy using Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a promising platform due to an unprecedented sensitivity down to the single spin level. At the nanoscale, high nuclear spin polarization through spin fluctuations (statistical polarization) far outweighs thermal polarization. However, until now efficient NMR detection using coherent averaging techniques could not be applied to the detection of statistical polarization, leading to long measurement times. Here we present two protocols to enable coherent averaging of statistical oscillating signals through rectification. We demonstrate these protocols on an artificial radiofrequency signal detected with a single NV center at 2.7 T. Through this, the signal-to-noise scaling with number of measurements $N$ is improved from $N^{0.5}$ to $N^1$, improving the measurement time significantly. The relevance of rectification for the detection of statistical polarization using NV ensembles is outlined, paving the way for efficient nanoscale NMR spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ovidiu Cristinel Stoica</p>
            <p>Both empirical and theoretical objective science can only access relations, revealing nothing about the intrinsic nature of the entities "in relation". We typically refer to these entities as "matter", assuming their nature is irrelevant and that relational structures alone explain all phenomena, including consciousness. This would imply that consciousness arises not from matter itself but solely from its structural configurations. Consequently, if two worlds possess isomorphic structures and obey identical dynamical laws, isomorphic systems within these worlds should be equally sentient or insentient. I demonstrate that if this premise held true, the memories within an observer's brain would bear no correlation to the external world. Yet since we do acquire knowledge of the external world, structure alone must be insufficient: there exists something beyond relations, the intrinsic essence of the "stuff in relation". This essence imbues the observer's structure with sentience, metaphorically "breathing fire" into it. In turn, the observer confers physical meaning upon the world's structures. Remarkably, this conclusion emerges directly from physics and mathematics. Without acknowledging this intrinsic element, we would be incapable not only of subjective experience but also of acquiring any objective knowledge about the physical world.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jen-Tsung Hsiang, Bei-Lok Hu</p>
            <p>We continue our investigation of multi-partite open quantum systems comprising layers of structure using the atom-field-medium interactions as a familiarly important example. Same as in Paper I~\cite{HH24} we consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by the presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the graded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian nature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin equation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix elements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the $N$ system-atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is particularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a Gaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. As an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one system atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space, measured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one somewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The special feature refers to the non-monotonic behavior of the purity function when the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving the Robertson-Schrödinger function and displaying a similar qualitative behavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction scheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for the idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional treatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian open systems.</p>

            <h2>Symmetric channel verification for purifying noisy quantum channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kento Tsubouchi, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Ryuji Takagi, Nobuyuki Yoshioka</p>
            <p>Symmetry inherent in quantum states has been widely used to reduce the effect of noise in quantum error correction and a quantum error mitigation technique known as symmetry verification. However, these symmetry-based techniques exploit symmetry in quantum states rather than quantum channels, limiting their application to cases where the entire circuit shares the same symmetry. In this work, we propose symmetric channel verification (SCV), a channel purification protocol that leverages the symmetry inherent in quantum channels. By introducing different phases to each symmetric subspace and employing a quantum phase estimation-like circuit, SCV can detect and correct symmetry-breaking noise in quantum channels. We further propose a hardware-efficient implementation of SCV at the virtual level, which requires only a single-qubit ancilla and is robust against the noise in the ancilla qubit. Our protocol is applied to various Hamiltonian simulation circuits and phase estimation circuits, resulting in a significant reduction of errors. Furthermore, in setups where only Clifford unitaries can be used for noise purification, which is relevant in the early fault-tolerant regime, we show that SCV under Pauli symmetry represents the optimal purification method.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating large-scale linear algebra using variational quantum imaginary time evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Willie Aboumrad, Daiwei Zhu, Claudio Girotto, François-Henry Rouet, Jezer Jojo, Robert Lucas, Jay Pathak, Ananth Kaushik, Martin Roetteler</p>
            <p>Graph partitioning techniques enhance the efficiency of solving large-scale linear systems in the context of Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Even for systems of linear equations that are highly sparse, their direct solution via factorization methods, such as LU or Cholesky decomposition, is computationally expensive due to the introduction of non-zero elements, or ``fill-in.'' We introduce a quantum approach to the graph partitioning problem based on the variational quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm (VarQITE), allowing to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of reordering of sparse matrices to minimize the fill-in. We develop a hybrid quantum/classical pipeline to accelerate Finite Element solvers by integrating the VarQITE algorithm into the production workflow of Ansys' industrial software LS-DYNA. This allows to study multiple different types of FEA problems, ranging from mechanical engineering to computational fluid dynamics. We prove out that VarQITE positively impacts LS-DYNA workflows by measuring the wall-clock time to solution of FEA problems when compared against the classical heuristic graph partitioning solver in LS-DYNA. The selected instances cover a range of FEA problems, including simulation of blood pumps, roof crushing of cars, and vibration analysis of cars. We report performance results for our hybrid quantum-accelerated workflow on FEA meshes of up to 5.9M vertices and 55 million edges. We find that the wall clock time of the heuristics solutions used in the industry-grade solver is improved by up to 12\%. We also execute the VarQITE algorithm on quantum hardware (IonQ Aria and IonQ Forte) and find that the results are comparable to noiseless and noisy simulations. Finally, we introduce a hybrid technique for post-processing the found solutions with classical refinement heuristics such as Fiduccia-Mattheyses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Anna Mele, Giovanni Barbarino, Vittorio Giovannetti, Marco Fanizza</p>
            <p>Non-asymptotic quantum Shannon theory analyses how to transmit quantum information across a quantum channel as efficiently as possible within a specified error tolerance, given access to a finite, fixed, number of channel uses. In a recent work, we derived computable lower bounds on the non-asymptotic capacities of memoryless bosonic Gaussian channels. In this work, we extend these results to the non-Markovian bosonic Gaussian channel introduced in F. A. Mele, G. D. Palma, M. Fanizza, V. Giovannetti, and L. Lami IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 70(12), 8844-8869 (2024), which describes non-Markovian effects in optical fibres and is a non-Markovian generalisation of the pure loss channel. This allows us to determine how many uses of a non-Markovian optical fibre are sufficient in order to transmit $k$ qubits, distil $k$ ebits, or generate $k$ secret-key bits up to a given error tolerance $\varepsilon$. To perform our analysis, we prove novel properties of singular values of Toeplitz matrices, providing an error bound on the convergence rate of the celebrated Avram-Parter's theorem, which we regard as a new tool of independent interest for the field of quantum information theory and matrix analysis.</p>

            <p>We experimentally optimize the frequency of flux-tunable couplers in a superconducting quantum processor to minimize the impact of spectator transmons during quantum operations (single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates and readout) on other transmons. We adapt a popular transmon-like tunable-coupling element, achieving high-fidelity, low-leakage controlled-$Z$ gates with unipolar, fast-adiabatic pulsing only on the coupler. We demonstrate the ability of the tunable coupler to null residual $ZZ$ coupling as well as exchange couplings in the one- and two-excitation manifolds. However, the nulling of these coherent interactions is not simultaneous, prompting the exploration of tradeoffs. We present experiments pinpointing spectator effects on specific quantum operations. We also study the combined effect on the three types of operations using repeated quantum parity measurements.</p>

            <p>Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used: with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (3 {\mu}m gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal.</p>

            <p>Strongly correlated topological phases of matter are central to modern condensed matter physics and quantum information technology but often challenging to probe and control in material systems. The experimental difficulty of accessing these phases has motivated the use of engineered quantum platforms for simulation and manipulation of exotic topological states. Among these, the Laughlin state stands as a cornerstone for topological matter, embodying fractionalization, anyonic excitations, and incompressibility. Although its bosonic analogs have been realized on programmable quantum simulators, a genuine fermionic Laughlin state has yet to be demonstrated on a quantum processor. Here, we realize the {\nu} = 1/3 fermionic Laughlin state on IonQ's Aria-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using an efficient and scalable Hamiltonian variational ansatz with 369 two-qubit gates on a 16-qubit circuit. Employing symmetry-verification error mitigation, we extract key observables that characterize the Laughlin state, including correlation hole and chiral edge modes, with strong agreement to exact diagonalization benchmarks. This work establishes a scalable quantum framework to simulate material-intrinsic topological orders and provides a starting point to explore its dynamics and excitations on digital quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Study of Magnetic Field Resilient High Impedance High-Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Camille Roy, Simone Frasca, Pasquale Scarlino</p>
            <p>Superconducting resonators with high-kinetic inductance play a central role in hybrid quantum circuits, enabling strong coupling with quantum systems with small electric dipole moment and improved parametric amplification. However, optimizing these resonators simultaneously for high internal quality factors ($Q_i$) and resilience to strong magnetic fields remains challenging. In this study, we systematically compare superconducting resonators fabricated from niobium nitride (NbN) and granular aluminum (grAl) thin films, each having similar kinetic inductance values ($L_k \sim 100$ pH/sq). At zero magnetic field, resonators made from grAl exhibit higher $Q_i$ compared to their NbN counterparts. However, under applied magnetic fields, NbN resonators demonstrate significantly better resilience. Moreover, NbN resonators exhibit an unexpected increase in $Q_i$ at intermediate in-plane magnetic fields ($B_{\parallel} \sim 1$ T), which we attribute to an enhanced frequency detuning that reduce coupling to two-level system defects. In contrast, grAl resonators show a distinct critical field above which $Q_i$ rapidly decreases, strongly depending on resonator cross-section respect to the applied field direction. Characterization of the nonlinear properties at zero magnetic field reveals that the self-Kerr coefficient in grAl resonators is more than an order of magnitude higher than in NbN resonators, making grAl particularly attractive for applications requiring pronounced nonlinear interactions. Our findings illustrate a clear trade-off between the two materials: NbN offers superior magnetic-field resilience beneficial for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics applications, while grAl is more advantageous in low-field regimes demanding high impedance and strong nonlinearity.</p>

            <p>Achieving and controlling non-reciprocity in engineered photonic structures is of fundamental interest in science and engineering. Here, we introduce a tunable, non-Hermitian, nonlinear microwave dimer designed to precisely implement phase-non-reciprocal hopping dynamics between two spatially separated cavities at room temperature. Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. L. Dao</p>
            <p>In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} can outperform the popular \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to \texttt{EfficientSU2} in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regimes of the bosonic model, both \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground states, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} circuits with small a number of parameters, attained a comparable albeit not as good performance as the much deeper \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</p>

            <p>In this proceeding, we revisit the discussion presented in Ref.

Our study extends this analysis by focusing on the evolution of entanglement in the target system within the quantum switch framework, taking into account the influence of environmental conditions and control post-selection. We find that entanglement evolution is highly sensitive to these factors. While entanglement sudden death occurs under definite causal order, indefinite causal order can reverse this loss. We observe entanglement revival in high-temperature regimes and a sudden reappearance of entanglement under weak monitoring conditions at low temperatures. These findings provide insights into the resilience of the quantum switch in the presence of environmental disturbances and highlight its potential for applications where preserving entanglement is essential.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Péter E. Frenkel, Milán Mosonyi, Péter Vrana, Mihály Weiner</p>
            <p>The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szilágyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</p>

For suitably chosen parameters, the circuit hosts a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase protected by a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The ground state of the system is twofold degenerate and exhibits local spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry close to the edges of the circuit, leading to spontaneous localized edge supercurrents. The ground states host Majorana zero modes (MZM) at the edges of the circuit. On top of each of the two ground states, the system exhibits localized bound states at both edges, which are topologically protected against small disorder in the bulk. The spectrum of these boundary excitations should be observable in a circuit-QED experiment with feasible parameter choices.</p>

In this work, we study a coupling that is mixed between two pairs of quadratures of a bosonic mode and a spin.

We demonstrate this configuration with a simple toy model, quantify the expected improvements to photon shot-noise dephasing of the spin, and describe an approach to fast qubit readout via the Kerr shift. Further, we show how such a regime is achievable in superconducting circuits because magnetic and electric couplings can be of comparable strength, using two examples: the Cooper pair transistor and the fluxonium molecule.</p>

Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aman Gupta, Daniel Prasanth, Venkat Chandra Gunja</p>
            <p>The future of quantum computing architecture is most likely the one in which a large number of clients are either fully classical or have a very limited quantum capability while a very small number of servers having the capability to perform quantum computations and most quantum computational tasks are delegated to these quantum servers. In this architecture, it becomes very crucial that a classical/semi-classical client is able to keep the delegated data/ computation secure against eavesdroppers as well as the server itself, known as the blindness feature. In 2009, A. Broadbent et. al proposed a universal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocol based on measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) that enables a semi-classical client to delegate universal quantum computation to a quantum server, interactively and fetch the results while the computation itself remains blind to the server. In this work, we propose an implementation (with examples) of UBQC in the current quantum computing architecture, a fully classical client, a quantum server (IBM Quantum) and the computation does not proceed interactively (projective measurement basis is not decided by previous measurement outcome). We combined UBQC with the 8-state remote state preparation (RSP) protocol, to blindly prepare the initial cluster state, which is an initial resource state in UBQC protocol, to allow a completely classical client to perform delegated blind quantum computation. Such an implementation has already been shown to be secure in a game-based security setting, which is the weakest security model.</p>

            <p>We show that Heisenberg exchange interactions between the neighboring spins comprising an ensemble spin qubit (E-qubit) can act as an intrinsic error mitigator, increasing gate fidelity even at high temperatures. As an example, the fidelity of a {\pi} gate applied to E-qubits above 1 K was studied by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange strength to show an exchange coupled E-qubit exhibits higher fidelity than a single-spin based qubit. We also investigate the coherence properties of E-qubits and find that the coherence time of an E-qubit extends linearly with the number of spins in the ensemble. This suggests that exchange interactions effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise, achieving a coherence time greater than 1 ms at 1 K with an ensemble of only seven spins. Additionally, the ferromagnetic isotropic exchange prevents fidelity loss induced by spatial field gradients/inhomogeneity in Zeeman and/or control fields. Therefore, exchange-coupled spin qubits could enable fault-tolerant quantum operations and long-coherence times at elevated temperatures (>1 K).</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</p>

            <p>A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</p>

These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Spin orientation by electric current in altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. E. Golub, L. Šmejkal</p>
            <p>It is shown that the flow of electric current in an altermagnet results in the formation of a homogeneous electron spin orientation in the sample. The spin of the conduction electrons generated in altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-momentum couplings, is quadratic in the current magnitude, varies as the second angular harmonic under variation of the current direction and does not require broken inversion symmetry. The effect is thus distinct from conventional current induced spin polarization phenomena which are linear in the current, vary as a first angular harmonic under variation of current direction and require broken inversion symmetry. The current-induced spin orientation in altermagnets is obtained using the kinetic theory for distribution functions in the spin-splitted subbands. It is shown that an application of external magnetic field significantly enhances the electron spin.</p>

            <p>The gatemon qubits, made of transparent super-semi Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such "gateless gatemon" qubits can be driven with Rabi frequencies more than 100 MHz, enabling gate operations much faster than what is possible with traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our gateless gatemons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent super-semi junctions bring to quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.</p>

            <p>Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</p>

            <p>Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.</p>

            <p>We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p>Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</p>

            <p>We explore the effects of gravitational waves (GWs) on hydrogen's radio spectral lines, focusing on the ground-state hyperfine transition and radiative transitions in highly excited Rydberg states. To analyze GW impacts on hyperfine structure, we derive Maxwell's equations in a gravitational-wave background using linearized gravity and the $3+1$ formalism. Our findings reveal that GWs induce energy shifts in hyperfine magnetic substates, modifying the 21 cm line. However, these energy shifts fall well below the detection limits of current radio astronomical instruments. For transitions in highly excited states, which produce radio recombination lines (RRL), the influence of GW manifests itself as spectral broadening, with the fractional linewidth for $\mathrm{H}n\alpha$ scaling as $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 \sim n^7\omega^2_{\mathrm{gw}}h(t)$. This suggests that RRLs could serve as probes for ultra-high-frequency GWs, particularly given that Rydberg atoms in the interstellar medium can reach quantum numbers above $n=100$. As an example of possibly detectable high frequency GW source, We investigate GWs emitted during the inspiral of planetary-mass primordial black hole binaries, where GW-induced broadening in RRLs could exceed natural broadening effects. Additionally, we examine the influence of the recently detected stochastic gravitational-wave background on hydrogen spectral lines.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

Our applications include (i) certifying whether auxiliary qubits can be safely disposed of, (ii) determining if a system is separable across a given bipartition, (iii) checking the transversality of a gate with respect to a given stabilizer code, and (iv) computing post-measurement states for computational basis measurements. Further, this logic is extended to accommodate universal quantum computing by deriving Hoare triples for the $T$-gate, multiply-controlled unitaries such as the Toffoli gate, and some gate injection circuits that use associated magic states. A number of interesting results emerge from this logic, including a lower bound on the number of $T$ gates necessary to perform a multiply-controlled $Z$ gate.</p>

            <p>A popular machine-learning model for regression tasks, including stock-market prediction, weather forecasting and real-estate pricing, is the classical support vector regression (SVR). However, a practically realisable quantum SVR remains to be formulated. We devise annealing-based algorithms, namely simulated and quantum-classical hybrid, for training two SVR models and compare their empirical performances against the SVR implementation of Python's scikit-learn package for facial-landmark detection (FLD), a particular use case for SVR. Our method is to derive a quadratic-unconstrained-binary formulation for the optimisation problem used for training a SVR model and solve this problem using annealing. Using D-Wave's hybrid solver, we construct a quantum-assisted SVR model, thereby demonstrating a slight advantage over classical models regarding FLD accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that annealing-based SVR models predict landmarks with lower variances compared to the SVR models trained by gradient-based methods. Our work is a proof-of-concept example for applying quantum-assisted SVR to a supervised-learning task with a small training dataset.</p>

            <p>We provide a new characterisation of quantum supermaps in terms of an axiom that refers only to sequential and parallel composition. Consequently, we generalize quantum supermaps to arbitrary monoidal categories and operational probabilistic theories. We do so by providing a simple definition of locally-applicable transformation on a monoidal category. The definition can be rephrased in the language of category theory using the principle of naturality, and can be given an intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of which all proofs are presented. In our main technical contribution, we use this diagrammatic representation to show that locally-applicable transformations on quantum channels are in one-to-one correspondence with deterministic quantum supermaps. This alternative characterization of quantum supermaps is proven to work for more general multiple-input supermaps such as the quantum switch and on arbitrary normal convex spaces of quantum channels such as those defined by satisfaction of signaling constraints.</p>

            <p>The Bell theorem is explored in terms of a trade-off relation between underlying assumptions within the hidden variable model framework. In this paper, recognizing the incorporation of hidden variables as one of the fundamental assumptions, we propose a measure termed `hidden information' taking account of their distribution. This measure quantifies the number of hidden variables that essentially contribute to the empirical statistics. For factorizable models, hidden variable models that satisfy `locality' without adhering to the measurement independence criterion, we derive novel relaxed Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequalities. These inequalities elucidate trade-off relations between measurement dependence and hidden information in the CHSH scenario. It is also revealed that the relation gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the measures to be realized by a factorizable model.</p>

            <p>The classical simulation of quantum dynamics plays an important role in our understanding of quantum complexity, and in the development of quantum technologies. Efficient techniques such as those based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem for Clifford circuits, tensor networks for low entanglement-generating circuits, or Wick's theorem for fermionic Gaussian states, have become central tools in quantum computing. In this work, we contribute to this body of knowledge by presenting a framework for classical simulations, dubbed "$\mathfrak{g}$-sim", which is based on the underlying Lie algebraic structure of the dynamical process. When the dimension of the algebra grows at most polynomially in the system size, there exists observables for which the simulation is efficient. Indeed, we show that $\mathfrak{g}$-sim enables new regimes for classical simulations, is able to deal with certain forms of noise in the evolution, as well as can be used to tackle several paradigmatic variational and non-variational quantum computing tasks. For the former, we perform Lie-algebraic simulations to train and optimize parametrized quantum circuits (thus effectively showing that some variational models can be dequantized), design enhanced parameter initialization strategies, solve tasks of quantum circuit synthesis, and train a quantum-phase classifier. For the latter, we report large-scale noiseless and noisy simulations on benchmark problems. By comparing the limitations of $\mathfrak{g}$-sim and certain Wick's theorem-based simulations, we find that the two methods become inefficient for different types of states or observables, hinting at the existence of distinct, non-equivalent, resources for classical simulation.</p>

            <p>We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$ dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of tri-unitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual-unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.</p>

            <p>We study the stroboscopic non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of periodically kicked Hamiltonians involving homogeneous central-spin interactions. The system exhibits a strong fragmentation of Hilbert space into four-dimensional Floquet-Krylov subspaces, which oscillate between two disjointed two-dimensional subspaces and thus break the discrete time-translation symmetry of the system. Our analytical and numerical analyses reveal that fully polarized states of the satellite spins exhibit fragmentations that are stable against perturbations and have high overlap with Floquet eigenstates of atypically low bipartite entanglement entropy (scar states). Motivated by the breaking of discrete time translation symmetry by Floquet-Krylov subspaces, we introduce a novel type of time crystal that we call a ``subspace time crystal''. We present evidence of robust time-crystalline behavior in the form of a period doubling of the total magnetization of fully polarized satellite spin states that persists over long time scales. We compute non-equilibrium phase diagrams with respect to a magnetic field, coupling terms, and pulse error for various interaction types, including Heisenberg, Ising, XXZ, and XX. We also discuss possible experimental realizations of scar time crystals in color center, quantum dot, and rare-earth ion platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Badhani, Sibasish Ghosh</p>
            <p>This work outlines a consistent method of identifying subsystems in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, independent of the underlying inner-product structure. Such Hilbert spaces arise in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric quantum mechanics, where a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is made self-adjoint by changing the inner product using the so-called ``metric operator". This is the framework of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. For composite quantum systems in this framework, defining subsystems is generally considered feasible only when the metric operator is chosen to have a tensor product form so that a partial trace operation can be well defined. In this work, we use arguments from algebraic quantum mechanics to show that the subsystems can be well-defined in every metric space - irrespective of whether or not the metric is of tensor product form. This is done by identifying subsystems with a decomposition of the underlying C*-algebra into commuting subalgebras. Although the choice of the metric is known to have no effect on the system's statistics, we show that different choices of the metric can lead to inequivalent subsystem decompositions. Each of the subsystems can be tomographically constructed and these subsystems satisfy the no-signalling principle. With these results, we put all the choices of the metric operator on an equal footing for composite systems.</p>

We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</p>

The condition is also shown to imply exponential decay of the state's mutual information between disjoint regions, and hence exponential clustering of local observables. The applicability of the general results is demonstrated on the quantum Ising model in transverse field.

            <p>Uncertainty principle forbids one to determine which of the two paths a quantum system has travelled, unless interference between the alternatives had been destroyed by a measuring device, e.g., by a pointer. One can try to weaken the coupling between the device and the system, in order to avoid the veto. We demonstrate, however, that a weak pointer is at the same time an inaccurate one, and the information about the path taken by the system in each individual trial is inevitably lost. We show also that a similar problem occurs if a classical system is monitored by an inaccurate quantum meter. In both cases one can still determine some characteristic of the corresponding statistical ensemble, a relation between path probabilities in the classical case, and a relation between the probability amplitudes if a quantum system is involved.</p>

            <h2>Explicit block encodings of boundary value problems for many-body elliptic operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Kharazi, Ahmad M. Alkadri, Jin-Peng Liu, Kranthi K. Mandadapu, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>Simulation of physical systems is one of the most promising use cases of future digital quantum computers. In this work we systematically analyze the quantum circuit complexities of block encoding the discretized elliptic operators that arise extensively in numerical simulations for partial differential equations, including high-dimensional instances for many-body simulations. When restricted to rectangular domains with separable boundary conditions, we provide explicit circuits to block encode the many-body Laplacian with separable periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions, using standard discretization techniques from low-order finite difference methods. To obtain high-precision, we introduce a scheme based on periodic extensions to solve Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems using a high-order finite difference method, with only a constant increase in total circuit depth and subnormalization factor. We then present a scheme to implement block encodings of differential operators acting on more arbitrary domains, inspired by Cartesian immersed boundary methods. We then block encode the many-body convective operator, which describes interacting particles experiencing a force generated by a pair-wise potential given as an inverse power law of the interparticle distance. This work provides concrete recipes that are readily translated into quantum circuits, with depth logarithmic in the total Hilbert space dimension, that block encode operators arising broadly in applications involving the quantum simulation of quantum and classical many-body mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Radiative pumping vs vibrational relaxation of molecular polaritons: a bosonic mapping approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan B. Pérez-Sánchez, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>We present a formalism to study molecular polaritons based on the bosonization of molecular vibronic states. This formalism accommodates an arbitrary number of molecules $N$, excitations and internal vibronic structures, making it ideal for investigating molecular polariton processes accounting for finite $N$ effects. We employ this formalism to rigorously derive radiative pumping and vibrational relaxation rates. We show that radiative pumping is the emission from incoherent excitons and divide its rate into transmitted and re-absorbed components. On the other hand, the vibrational relaxation rate in the weak linear vibronic coupling regime is composed of a $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ contribution already accounted for by radiative pumping, and a $\mathcal{O}(1/N^2)$ contribution from a second-order process in the \textit{single}-molecule light-matter coupling that we call polariton-assisted Raman scattering. This scattering is enhanced when the difference between fluorescence and lower polariton frequencies matches a Raman-active excitation.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Non-Markovianity in Ergodic Channels: Measuring Memory Retention through Ergotropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritam Basu, Anish Chakraborty, Himanshu Badhani, Mir Alimuddin, Samyadeb Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>In this work we introduce and characterize a broad class of quantum operations with a unique fixed point, termed quantum ergodic channels. We derive Lindblad-type master equations for these channels in arbitrary finite dimensions and analyze their non-Markovian dynamics using established measures. When the fixed point is a passive state, the channels exhibit ergotropy dynamics with notable thermodynamic implications. Specifically, under Markovian processes, ergotropy, a measure of the extractable work from a system under unitary evolution monotonically decreases. However, in non-Markovian dynamics, ergotropy fluctuates, leading to a backflow effect that highlights memory-induced resource recovery. Our findings suggest that this ergotropy backflow could serve as an operationally meaningful indicator of non-Markovianity, offering new perspectives on the interplay between memory effects and thermodynamic behavior in open quantum systems. This study enhances the theoretical framework for understanding energy dynamics under ergodic channels and highlights new avenues for exploring the implications of memory effects in quantum batteries.</p>

            <p>The path-integral approach to topological quantum error correction provides a unified way to construct and analyze fault-tolerant circuits in spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate its utility and versatility at hand of a simple example: We construct a new fault-tolerant circuit for the toric-code phase by traversing its path integral on a $(x,y,z)$ cubic lattice in the $x+y$ direction. The circuit acts on qubits on a square lattice, and alternates between horizontal nearest-neighbor $CX$ gates and vertical nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ and $XX$ measurements. We show how to incorporate boundaries and corners into the fault-tolerant circuit and how to perform topologically protected logic gates. As a specific example, we consider performing a fault-tolerant logical $ZZ$ measurement via lattice surgery of two spatial rectangular blocks of our fault-tolerant circuit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trinidad B. Lantaño, Luciano Petruzziello, Susana F. Huelga, Martin B. Plenio</p>
            <p>Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction in the Newtonian limit. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering the general relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</p>

            <h2>Analog Quantum Simulation of Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics in Molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jong-Kwon Ha, Ryan J. MacDonell</p>
            <p>Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for quantum dynamics simulations. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. We present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinchi Huang, Hirofumi Nishi, Taichi Kosugi, Yoshifumi Kawada, Yu-ichiro Matsushita</p>
            <p>Simulating differential equations on classical computers becomes an intractable problem if the grid size is extremely large. Quantum computers are believed to achieve a possibly exponential speedup in the matrix operation. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving the advection-diffusion-reaction equation by employing a novel approximate probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) operator. First, the effectiveness of the proposed approximate PITE operator is justified by the theoretical evaluation of the error. Next, we construct the explicit quantum circuit to realize the imaginary-time evolution of the Hamiltonian coming from the advection-diffusion equation, whose gate complexity is logarithmic regarding the size of the discretized Hamiltonian matrix. Compared to the existing algorithms for the quantum linear system problem, our algorithm achieves an exponential speedup regarding the matrix size at the cost of a worse dependence on the error bound. Moreover, numerical simulations using gate-based quantum emulator for 1D/2D examples are also provided to verify our algorithm. Finally, we extend our algorithm to the coupled system of advection-diffusion equations to show the prospects for practical applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Mehta, Anne Müller</p>
            <p>In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, a user that holds a ciphertext and a function key can learn the result of applying the function to the plaintext message. Security requires that the user does not learn anything beyond the function evaluation. We extend this notion to the quantum setting by providing definitions and a construction for a quantum functional encryption (QFE) scheme which allows for the evaluation of polynomialy-sized circuits on arbitrary quantum messages. Our construction is built upon quantum garbled circuits [BY22]. We also investigate the relationship of QFE to the seemingly unrelated notion of unclonable encryption (UE) and find that any QFE scheme universally achieves the property of unclonable functional encryption (UFE). In particular we assume the existence of an unclonable encryption scheme with quantum decryption keys which was recently constructed by [AKY24]. Our UFE guarantees that two parties cannot simultaneously recover the correct function outputs using two independently sampled function secret keys. As an application we give the first construction for public-key UE with variable decryption keys. Lastly, we establish a connection between quantum indistinguishability obfuscation (qiO) and quantum functional encryption (QFE); Showing that any multi-input indistinguishability-secure quantum functional encryption scheme unconditionally implies the existence of qiO.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhang Loran, Ali Mostafazadeh</p>
            <p>The transfer matrix of scattering theory in one dimension can be expressed in terms of the time-evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. In particular, it admits a Dyson series expansion which turns out to facilitate the construction of the low-frequency series expansion of the scattering data. In two and three dimensions, there is a similar formulation of stationary scattering where the scattering properties of the scatterer are extracted from the evolution operator for a corresponding effective quantum system. We explore the utility of this approach to scattering theory in the study of the scattering of low-frequency time-harmonic scalar waves, $e^{-i\omega t}\psi(\mathbf{r})$, with $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfying the Helmholtz equation, $[\nabla^2+k^2\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)]\psi(\mathbf{r})=0$, $\omega$ and $k$ being respectively the angular frequency and wavenumber of the incident wave, and $\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)$ denoting the relative permittivity of the carrier medium which in general takes complex values. We obtain explicit formulas for low-frequency scattering amplitude, examine their effectiveness in the study of a class of exactly solvable scattering problems, and outline their application in devising a low-frequency cloaking scheme.</p>

            <p>Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum technologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of such light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this direction. Specifically, it has been shown how the use of fully quantized approaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high harmonic generation, can lead to the generation of high photon-number non-classical and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the fundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and discuss the recent developments and future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong light fields with the potential application in ultrafast and quantum information science. These findings represent an important step in the development of novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy methods, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light and those of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Permutation puzzles, such as the Rubik's Cube and the 15 puzzle, are enjoyed by the general public and mathematicians alike. Here we introduce quantum versions of permutation puzzles where the pieces of the puzzles are replaced with indistinguishable quantum particles. The moves in the puzzle are achieved by swapping or permuting the particles. We show that simply permuting the particles can be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle, even though the identical particles are entangled. However, we obtain a genuine quantum puzzle by adding a quantum move: the square root of SWAP. The resulting puzzle cannot be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle. We focus predominately on the quantization of the $2\times 2$ slide puzzle and briefly treat the $2\times 2 \times 1$ Rubik's Cube.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate three schemes for implementing Controlled-Z (CZ) gates between individual ytterbium (Yb) rare-earth ions doped into yttrium orthovanadate (YVO$_4$ or YVO). Specifically, we investigate the CZ gates based on magnetic dipolar interactions between Yb ions, photon scattering off a cavity, and a photon interference-based protocol, with and without an optical cavity. We introduce a theoretical framework for precise computations of state and gate infidelities, accounting for noise effects. We then compute the state fidelity for each scheme to evaluate the feasibility of their experimental implementation. Based on these results, we compare the performance of the two-qubit gate schemes and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. We conclude that the probabilistic photon interference-based scheme offers the best fidelity scaling with cooperativity and is superior with the current technology of Yb values, while photon scattering is nearly deterministic but slower with less favourable fidelity scaling as a function of cooperativity. The cavityless magnetic dipolar scheme provides a fast, deterministic gate with decent fidelities if close ion localization can be realized. While focusing on $^{171}\text{Yb}^{3+}: \text{YVO}$ system as a case study, the theoretical tools and approaches developed in this work are broadly applicable to other spin qubit systems.</p>

This work introduces and proves, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the Petz in terms of entanglement fidelity. In some special cases, the violation of this condition can be easily characterized by a simple commutator that can be efficiently computed.

            <p>With the demonstrated ability to perform calculations in seconds that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years, quantum computers namely hold the promise of radically advancing sustainable IT. However, quantum computers face challenges due to the inherent noise in physical qubits, necessitating error correction for reliable operation in solving industrial-scale problems, which will require more computation time, energy, and electronic components than initial laboratory-scale experiments. Yet, while researchers have modeled and analyzed the environmental impacts of classical computers using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the environmental performance of quantum computing remains unknown to date. This study contributes to filling this critical gap in two ways: (1) by establishing an environmental profile for quantum computers based on superconducting qubits; and (2) by comparing it to a functionally equivalent profile of a state-of-the-art supercomputer. With the comparison based on the problem size, the paper shows how the usage time can drive an environmental advantage for quantum computers under specific scaling conditions and quantum error correcting codes. The results emphasize that quantum error correction hardware has a substantial environmental impact due to the numerous electronic components needed to achieve 100 logical qubits. This paper can serve as a basis for designing more environmentally friendly quantum computers and for establishing their environmental profiles, as well as those of the human activities that will use them.</p>

            <p>Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schrödinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.</p>

            <p>Impurity-bound excitons in II-VI direct-bandgap semiconductors are promising optically active solid-state spin qubits that combine exceptional optical quantum efficiency with an ultra-low spin noise environment. Previous studies on single impurities relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving of quantum emitters to precisely control optical transitions and maintain coherence of the emission. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission of quantum light from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. The resonantly driven emitter exhibits bright quantum light emission that preserves the phase of the resonant drive, validated through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation enables us to directly measure the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, which indicates high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically-driven ionization process that we attribute to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We show that incoherent, low-power laser pumping efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns, recovering the resonance fluorescence emission from the bound exciton. These results pave the way for coherent optical and spin control of the single impurity states through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Understanding the Page curve and resolving the black hole information puzzle in terms of the entanglement dynamics of black holes has been a key question in fundamental physics. In principle, the current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Our findings indicate that while both entanglement entropy measurement protocols accurately estimate the Rényi entropy in numerical simulation, the randomized measurement protocol has a particular advantage over the swap-based many-body interference protocol in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques, we establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entanglement entropy of complex quantum systems and can probe black hole dynamics within simplified toy qubit models.</p>

This work presents a novel unifying abstraction, called the position graph, for different types of hardware architectures. Using this abstraction, we model trapped-ion Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures and enable high-quality, scalable superconducting compilation methods. In particular, we devise a scheduling algorithm called SHuttling-Aware PERmutative heuristic search algorithm (SHAPER) to tackle the complex constraints and dynamics of trapped-ion QCCD with the cooperation of state-of-the-art permutation-aware mapping. This approach generates native, executable circuits and ion instructions on the hardware that adheres to the physical constraints of shuttling-based quantum computers. Using the position graph abstraction, we evaluate our algorithm on theorized and actual architectures. Our algorithm can successfully compile programs for these architectures where other state-of-the-art algorithms fail. In the cases when other algorithms complete, our algorithm produces a schedule that is $14\%$ faster on average, up to $69\%$ in the best case.\\ {\bf Reproducibility:} source code and computational results are available at $[$will be added upon acceptance$]$</p>

            <h2>Simulating methylamine using symmetry adapted qubit-excitation-based variational quantum eigensolver</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin M. Makushin, Aleksey K. Fedorov</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose and analyze optimization strategies for the VQE algorithm that combine various methods, including molecular point group symmetries (symmetry adaptation), compact excitation circuits (qubit-excitation-based), different types of excitation sets, and qubit tapering. These strategies allow for a significant reduction in computational requirements while ensuring convergence to the correct energies. First, we apply these combinations to small molecules, such as LiH and BeH2, to evaluate their compatibility, accuracy, and potential applicability to larger problems. We then simulate the methylamine molecule within its restricted active space using the best-performing optimization strategies. Finally, we complete our analysis by estimating the resources required for full active-space simulations of the methylamine and formic acid molecules. Our best-performing optimization strategy reduces the number of two-qubit operations for simulating the methylamine molecule from 600,000 (in the STO-3G basis with a naive Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz) to approximately 12,000, using 26 qubits. Thus, the proposed combination of optimization methods can reduce the number of two-qubit operations by nearly two orders of magnitude. Although, we present alternative approaches that are of interest in the context of the further optimization in the number of two-qubit operation, we note that these approaches do not perform well enough in terms of the convergence to required energies. While these challenges persist, our resource analysis represents a valuable step towards the practical use of quantum computers and the development of better methods for optimizing computing resources.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyuan Wang, Romain Vasseur, Simon Trebst, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Han Zhang, Han-Chuan Kou, Peng Li</p>
            <p>In this work, we focus on the critical dynamics of the one-dimensional quasiperiodic p-wave-paired Aubry-André-Harper model, which exhibits a transition point between the gapped critical and the gapless localized phases. First, we disclose that the dynamical exponent features two distinct plateaus in the gapless localized phase. Besides the plateau with dynamical exponent $z=1.388$ near the transition point, there is a second one with $z=1$ away from the transition point. Then we demonstrate that these two plateaus intrinsically affect the critical dynamics with moderate quench rate by employing both one-way and round-trip quench protocols. In the one-way quench protocol, we clarify that the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) regime consists of two sub-regimes with different KZ exponents, which is a direct consequence of the two-plateau structure of the dynamical exponent. We also diagnose the KZ, pre-saturated, and saturated regimes by varying the quench rate from slow to fast limits. While, in the round-trip quench protocol, we confirm the interference effect of two critical dynamics and show a narrow neck in the oscillatory density of defects. It turns out that the position of the neck depends on the ratio of to-and-fro quench rates and the p-wave superconductivity pairing amplitude. We show how the position of the neck can be used to quantitatively determine the turning point of the two KZ sub-regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prashanti Priya Angara, Danylo Lykov, Ulrike Stege, Yuri Alexeev, Hausi Müller</p>
            <p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed to determine optimum and near optimum solutions of quadratic (and higher order) unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO or HUBO) problems, which in turn accurately model unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems. While the solution space of an unconstrained combinatorial optimization problem consists of all possible combinations of the objective function's decision variables, for a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the solution space consists only of solutions that satisfy the problem constraints. While solving such a QUBO problem optimally results in an optimal solution to the underlying constrained problem, setting the right penalty parameters is crucial. Moreover, finding suitable penalties that ensure near-optimal solutions is also challenging. In this article, we introduce our innovative profit-relaxation framework to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. Our effective hybrid approach transforms a selected constrained combinatorial optimization problem into an unconstrained profit problem, such that the solution spaces of the two problems are interrelated with respect to their solution qualities. This allows us to determine optimal and near-optimal solutions for the constrained problem. We use three NP-hard problems -- Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Independent Set, and Maximum Clique -- to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation of our profit-relaxation framework on two different platforms: Xanadu PennyLane and Argonne QTensor Quantum Circuit Simulator.</p>

            <h2>Sagnac interferometer-based noise-free superresolution using phase-controlled quantum erasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byoung S. Ham</p>
            <p>Interferometer-based precision measurements have been intensively studied for sensing and metrology over the past half century. In classical optics, the resolution and phase sensitivity of an optical signal are confined by diffraction limit and shot-noise limit (SNL), respectively. Highly entangled photon pairs, i.e., N00N states have been adapted to overcome SNL in quantum sensing over the last two decades. Recently, coherent light-excited quantum sensing has also been proposed and demonstrated for macroscopic quantum sensing to overcome the limited N scalability in N00N-based quantum sensing. Here, a Sagnac interferometer-based superresolution is proposed to solve environmental noises inevitable in an interferometer. Furthermore, a spatial light modulator takes over the role of phase-controlled quantum erasers to solve the linear optics-based complexity issue in the coherently-excited superresolution. Thus, the proposed Sagnac superresolution can beat the state-of-the-art ring laser gyroscope applied for inertial navigation and geodesy.</p>

            <p>Modeling composite systems of spins or electrons coupled to bosonic modes is of significant interest for many fields of applied quantum physics and chemistry. A quantum simulation can allow for the solution of quantum problems beyond classical numerical methods. However, implementing this on existing noisy quantum computers can be challenging due to the mapping between qubits and bosonic degrees of freedom, often requiring a large number of qubits or deep quantum circuits. In this work, we discuss quantum algorithms to solve composite systems by augmenting conventional superconducting qubits with microwave resonators used as computational elements. This enables direct representation of bosonic modes by resonators. We derive efficient algorithms for typical models and propose a device connectivity that allows for feasible scaling of simulations with linear overhead. We also show how the dissipation of resonators can be a useful parameter for modeling continuous bosonic baths. Experimental results demonstrating these methods were obtained on the IQM Resonance cloud platform, based on high-fidelity gates and tunable couplers. These results present the first digital quantum simulation including a computational resonator on a commercial quantum platform.</p>

            <h2>A non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics with local modulus symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Zhou</p>
            <p>We have constructed a non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics based on local modulus symmetry. The resulting connection in the covariant derivative is identified as the escape velocity of the gravitational field. A new real and positive function called the quantum metric function is attached to the complex conjugate of the wave function to satisfy the local modulus symmetry requirement. In an expanding universe, these theoretical features produce new effects that deviate from predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. The quantum metric function yields negligible change for microscopic objects but produces quantum pointer states for macroscopic objects, thus providing a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The time-reversal symmetry is broken in the new quantum kinematics, which has implications for the second law of thermodynamics. The modification of Newtonian gravity is negligible in smaller bound systems but can become significant at the galactic scales. Its potential association with the mass discrepancy problem in the galactic systems is discussed.</p>

            <p>Periodically driven (Floquet) systems can exhibit possibilities beyond what can be obtained in equilibrium. Both in Floquet systems and in the related problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then classify noninteracting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy equivalence.</p>

            <p>Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. These are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories, but we argue that they offer a simpler and more practical approach. Our main examples of involutive Markov categories have pre-C*-algebras, including infinite-dimensional ones, as objects, together with completely positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. In this context, we prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.</p>

            <p>Micro-Ring Resonators (MRRs) allow us to access the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect at a variety of tunable parameter combinations along exact analytic solutions. This higher-dimensional space of parameters for which the HOM effect occurs constitutes what is known as a Hong-Ou-Mandel manifold (HOMM). Using a parallel series of non-identical MRRs and changing relative round-trip phase shifts between MRRs allows for the manipulation of the wavelength locations of the HOM effect. Through clever design and fabrication, we can mold the HOMM to place multiple HOM effects, or lack thereof, precisely at desired locations in wavelength. In this paper we discuss how to adjust non-identical MRR parameters to change the resulting HOMM. We also promote example designs that exhibit advantageous HOMM structures, and highlight some of the diverse possibilities that can be accessed with different circuit design. Our main examples are: 1) a wavelength division multiplexer example that matches the HOM effect locations with the already established channels to integrate with a classical communication network and 2) a HOM-based entanglement switch that allows for the rapid switching between 2-photon NOON state outputs and completely separable single photon outputs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Yuki Haruna, Yusuke Nishida, Yoshiro Takahashi</p>
            <p>A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</p>

We aim to challenge the concept of a single "quantum divide" by offering a comprehensive view. We propose four divides: in science, technologies, between countries, and within societies. The "Quantum Divide in Science" highlights gaps among scientists and access inequalities in research communities. The second divide, "Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency," looks at technology adoption processes. The "Quantum Divide between Countries" examines adoption reasons and outcomes across countries with varying development levels. Lastly, the "Quantum Divide within Societies" addresses societal implications, one of the most discussed in literature. We propose directions to navigate these divides, noting their interconnectedness and impact on innovation ecosystems. This study guides those interested in the quantum divide, navigation strategies, and QT's influence on scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su, Ivar Martin</p>
            <p>Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories that supposedly describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy. We view the nonlocal effective theories including the simplest Lagrangian and its two-pole variant associated with a gapless Dirac zero as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomaly, we discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on possible phases, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</p>

            <p>Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</p>

Our benchtop implementation performs a forward and inverse pass through a free-space programmable spatial mode sorter configured to isolate photons in a point spread function (PSF)-adapted mode basis. During the forward pass, the fundamental mode is rejected, effectively eliminating light from an on-axis point-like star. On the inverse pass, the remaining modes are coherently recombined to form an image of a faint companion. Our experimental system is shown localizing an artificial exoplanet at sub-diffraction distances from its host star under a 1000:1 star-planet contrast.</p>

            <p>We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the crossover region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</p>

Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -> 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -> 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehua Tian, Xiaobao Liu, Jieci Wang, Jiliang Jing</p>
            <p>We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex May, Sabrina Pasterski, Chris Waddell, Michelle Xu</p>
            <p>In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we use cryptographic tools related to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture.</p>

When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</p>

            <h2>A Constructive Approach to Zauner's Conjecture via the Stark Conjectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus Appleby, Steven T Flammia, Gene S Kopp</p>
            <p>We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d > 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is more precisely a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known solutions, particularly the extensive work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of nonequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by maximal equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If K is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of K, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Topological Non-Fermi Liquid Phases in a Modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Long-Range Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sepide Mohamadi, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.</p>

            <h2>$\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</p>

            <h2>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Sinha, Trideb Shit, Avinash Tetarwal, Diptiman Sen, Sebabrata Mukherjee</p>
            <p>The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic intra-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</p>

            <h2>Quantum geometry and adiabaticity in molecules and in condensed matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele Resta</p>
            <p>The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.</p>

            <p>In superconducting quantum devices, Purcell filters protect qubit information from decaying into external lines by reducing external coupling at qubit frequencies while maintaining it at readout frequencies. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a novel Purcell filter design that places the readout resonator frequencies in a "linewidth plateau" below the filter's first resonant mode. This approach, based on direct admittance engineering, can simultaneously achieve strong qubit protection and nearly constant external coupling across a wide readout bandwidth, addressing the traditional tradeoff between these properties. We first present a lumped-element analysis of our filters. We then experimentally demonstrate a compact on-chip linewidth-plateau filter, coupled to four resonators across its approximately 1 GHz readout band. We compare the measured linewidths to numerical predictions, and show how the filter protects a frequency-tunable transmon qubit from external decay. We envision that our flexible design paradigm will aid in efforts to create multiplexed readout architectures for superconducting quantum circuits, with well-controlled external couplings.</p>

            <p>A promising quantum computing architecture comprises modules of superconducting quantum processors linked by optical channels via quantum transducers. To map transducer device performance to system-level channel performance, our model uses Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate 2-to-1 and 3-to-1 entanglement distillation protocols. We show that the Extreme Photon Loss distillation protocol is particularly high performing and that, even without distillation, present-day transducers are at the threshold of enabling Bell pair distribution with fidelities of 50%. If the next generation of transducers can improve by 3 orders of magnitude in both added noise and efficiency, and increase repetition rates by 50x, then they would allow for remote two-qubit gates achieving 99.7% fidelities at 100 kHz rates. These results set targets for transducers to be ready for deployment into scaled superconducting quantum computers.</p>

This architecture can be used as a test-bed for algorithms that benefit from high connectivity. We show that the central resonator can be used as a computational element, which offers the flexibility to encode a qubit for quantum computation or to utilize its bosonic modes which further enables quantum simulation of bosonic systems. To operate the quantum processing unit (QPU), we develop and benchmark the qubit-resonator conditional Z gate and the qubit-resonator MOVE operation. The latter allows for transferring a quantum state between one of the peripheral qubits and the computational resonator. We benchmark the QPU performance and achieve a genuinely multi-qubit entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state over all six qubits with a readout-error mitigated fidelity of $0.86$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Asaoka, Yasunari Suzuki, Yuuki Tokunaga</p>
            <p>Exploring an efficient and scalable architecture of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is vital for demonstrating useful quantum computing. Here, we propose and evaluate a scalable and practical architecture with a cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED) network. Our architecture takes advantage of the stability of neutral atoms and the flexibility of a CQED network. We show a concrete framework for implementing surface codes and numerically analyze the logical error rate and threshold values beyond the simplified circuit-level noise model on several network structures. Although the requirement of CQED parameters is demanding given the current performance of experimental systems, we show that an error-decoding algorithm tailored to our proposed architecture, where the loss information of ancillary photons is utilized, greatly improves the error threshold. For example, the internal cooperativity, a good figure of merit of the cavity performance for quantum computing, required for FTQC is relaxed to 1/5 compared to the normal error-decoding for the surface code. Since our proposal and results can be extended to other LDPC codes straightforwardly, our approach will lead to achieve more reliable FTQC using CQED.</p>

We derive the condition for the existence of these bound states and discuss its satisfiability in different regimes.

            <p>We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of spin models.</p>

            <p>Pre-fault tolerant quantum computers have already demonstrated the ability to estimate observable values accurately, at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. This has been enabled by error mitigation techniques that often rely on a representative model on the device noise. However, learning and maintaining these models is complicated by fluctuations in the noise over unpredictable time scales, for instance, arising from resonant interactions between superconducting qubits and defect two-level systems (TLS). Such interactions affect the stability and uniformity of device performance as a whole, but also affect the noise model accuracy, leading to incorrect observable estimation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that tuning of the qubit-TLS interactions helps reduce noise instabilities and consequently enables more reliable error-mitigation performance. These experiments provide a controlled platform for studying the performance of error mitigation in the presence of quasi-static noise. We anticipate that the capabilities introduced here will be crucial for the exploration of quantum applications on solid-state processors at non-trivial scales.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.</p>

            <p>Solving challenging problems in quantum chemistry is one of the leading promised applications of quantum computers. Within the quantum algorithms proposed for problems in excited state quantum chemistry, subspace-based quantum algorithms, including quantum subspace expansion (QSE), quantum equation of motion (qEOM) and quantum self-consistent equation-of-motion (q-sc-EOM), are promising for pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices. The working equation of QSE and qEOM requires solving a generalized eigenvalue equation with associated matrix elements measured on a quantum computer. Our quantitative analysis of the QSE method shows that the errors in eigenvalues increase drastically with an increase in the condition number of the overlap matrix when a generalized eigenvalue equation is solved in the presence of statistical sampling errors. This makes such methods unstable to errors that are unavoidable when using quantum computers. Further, at very high condition numbers of overlap matrix, the QSE's working equation could not be solved without any additional steps in the presence of sampling errors as it becomes ill-conditioned. It was possible to use the thresholding technique in this case to solve the equation, but the solutions achieved had missing excited states, which may be a problem for future chemical studies. We also show that excited-state methods that have an eigenvalue equation as the working equation, such as q-sc-EOM, do not have such problems and could be suitable candidates for excited-state quantum chemistry calculations using quantum computers.</p>

            <p>The term "light dragging" describes how the trajectory of light changes as it travels through a moving medium. This phenomenon facilitates the precise detection of incredibly slow speeds of light, which is widely used in quantum gate operations, state transfer, and quantum memory implementations, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have proposed the existence of a light-dragging effect in a magnomechanical system (MMS). The origin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive interactions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index profile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong dependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within the magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by adjusting the probe's detuning. The ability to control and manipulate the light drag through the MMS could be helpful in designing novel devices with improved functionality at the microscopic scale.</p>

            <p>The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</p>

We propose an entanglement witness, from whose violation, the generation of entanglement can be determined. We do this for both the noiseless case and when including thermal noise. Thermal noise can arise from two sources: the first being when the oscillator starts in a thermal state, and the second when a continuous thermal bath is in contact with the oscillator. We find that for the appropriate oscillator quality factor $Q$, violation always exists for any value of magnetic coupling $\lambda$ and thermal occupancy $\bar n$. Cooling the oscillator to its ground state provides an $O(\bar n)$ improvement in the EW violation than starting in a thermal state. However, this still requires at least 10$^{5}$ measurements to be determined. We then consider how to use magnetic interactions to realize this idea.</p>

            <h2>Quantum switches for single-photon routing and entanglement generation in waveguide-based networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Cumbrado, Ricardo Puebla</p>
            <p>The interconnection of quantum nodes holds great promise for scaling up quantum computing units and enabling information processing across long-distance quantum registers. Such quantum networks can be realized using superconducting qubits linked by waveguides, which facilitate fast and robust on-demand quantum information exchange via traveling single photons. In this article, we propose leveraging additional qubit degrees of freedom as quantum switches that coherently condition the system dynamics. These switches are implemented using a qubit dispersively coupled to transfer resonators, which mediate interactions between node qubits and quantum links. Through wavepacket shaping techniques, we demonstrate that when the switch is closed, full excitation transfer occurs as a propagating photon, whereas an open switch allows only partial transfer without distorting the shape of the emitted photon. Based on this switch mechanism, we present deterministic protocols for generating entangled states via single-photon routing across the network, such as Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states. The feasibility of our approach is validated through numerical simulations of a three-node network, incorporating decoherence and photon loss effects. Our results indicate that high-fidelity entangled states can be realized employing the proposed quantum switches in current state-of-the-art platforms.</p>

            <p>We revisit the Dicke superradiance problem, namely the time evolution of the density operator for an initially inverted ensemble of $N$ identical two-level systems (spins), undergoing collective spontaneous emission. This is one of the simplest examples of an open quantum system dynamics problem that admits a fully analytical solution. We provide a few different approaches to derive the analytical solution valid for any time during the evolution and for any number of spins. These approaches range from solving a set of coupled rate equations, to observing exceptional points stemming from non-Hermitian evolution, to the use of combinatorics and probabilistic methods, and finally to utilizing techniques based on the quantum jump unraveling of the master equation. The solution is expressed as a residue sum stemming from a contour integral in the complex plane and suggests the possibility of fully analytical solutions for a wider range of quantum open system dynamics problems.</p>

            <p>Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinfull model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</p>

            <h2>Single-photon scattering in giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hai Zhu, Xian-Li Yin, Jie-Qiao Liao</p>
            <p>The giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems have recently emerged as a promising platform for manipulating light-matter interactions. The combination of the multiple-point couplings and topological phase effect could lead to rich physical phenomena and effects. Here, we study single-photon scattering in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide coupled to either one or two two-level giant atoms. We assume that each giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via two coupling points and hence there exist four and sixteen coupling configurations for the single-giant-atom case and two-giant-atom separate coupling case, respectively. By solving the single-photon scattering problem in the real space, we obtain the exact expressions of the single-photon scattering amplitudes. It is found that a single photon in the SSH waveguide can be completely reflected or transmitted by choosing proper coupling configurations, coupling-point distances, atomic resonance frequency, and dimerization parameter. In addition, under proper parameter conditions, the scattering spectra are periodically modulated by the coupling-point distances. We also find that the collective behavior of the two giant atoms can be adjusted by quantum interference effect and topological effect and that the single-photon scattering spectra can exhibit the Lorentzian, super-Gaussian, electromagnetically induced transparencylike, and asymmetric Fano line shapes for some coupling configurations. This work will inspire the development of controllable single-photon devices based on the giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Averaging for High-Fidelity Quantum Logic Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell</p>
            <p>We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling Mølmer-Sørensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.I. Yukalov, E.P. Yukalova</p>
            <p>Quantum statistical systems, composed of atoms or molecules interacting with each other through highly singular non-integrable potentials, are considered. The treatment of such systems cannot start with the standard approximations such as Hartree, Hartree-Fock or Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov approximations because of non-integrability of the interaction potentials leading to divergences. It is shown that the iterative procedure for Green functions can be rearranged so that the starting approximation takes into account regularizing atomic correlations. Then all the following approximation orders contain only the regularized interaction potential producing no divergences. The method of constructing the regularizing correlation function is suggested, based on the solution of the scattering equation in the form of asymptotic series at short distance, which can be extrapolated to arbitrary spatial variables by means of self-similar approximation theory. Regularizing correlation functions for several kinds of atomic systems are exemplified.</p>

            <p>The optical pumping process is a fundamental tool for quantum protocols using the electronic and nuclear spins in the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers platform. In this work, we explore the process of electronic spin polarization through optical pumping from a thermodynamic perspective. We identify the sources of work and heat and show that the heat current is direct related to the experimentally accessible fluorescence of the NV center. We also show that the polarization of the electronic spin depends on the amount of work that is provided to the system by the laser pump. Moreover, we study the von Neumann entropy change in the process. We demonstrate that the entropy can be separated into two contributions: one due to the heat produced and the other due to the work provided, which is a consequence of the non-unitary nature of the pumping process. Finally, we show that increasing the power of the laser results in the increasing of the entropy of the final state, which hinders the polarization efficiency.</p>

This device comprises a chain of asymmetric kinetic inductance grids designed to deliver efficient three-wave mixing nonlinearity. We demonstrate high efficient coherent conversion among broadly distributed modes, and the mode frequency is continuously tunable by controlling the external magnetic field strength, making it ideally suited for quantum computing and communication applications requiring flexible and efficient frequency conversion.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth ions in bulk crystals are excellent solid-state quantum systems in quantum information science, owing to the exceptional optical and spin coherence properties. However, the weak fluorescence of single rare-earth ions present a significant challenge for scalability, necessitating the integration into micro-cavities. Thin films serve as a promising material platform for the integration, yet the fabrication without compromising the properties of the materials and rare-earth ions remains challenging. In this work, we fabricate micrometer-thin yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) films from bulk crystals using ion implantation techniques. The resulting films preserve the single-crystalline structure of the original bulk crystal. Notably, the embedded rare-earth ions are photo-stable and exhibit bulk-like spin coherence properties. Our results demonstrate the compatibility of bulk-like spin properties with the thin-film fabrication technique, facilitating the efficient integration of rare-earth ions into on-chip photonic devices and advancing the applications of rare-earth ions systems in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Na Li, Yang Zhao, Wen-Long Ma, Z. D. Wang, Yan-Kui Bai</p>
            <p>Entanglement distribution is a fundamental property in quantum many-body physics, but the effect of long-range interactions on the distribution has not been fully understood. Here, we study long-range two-party entanglement (TPE) and explore its distribution properties in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions(ELRIs and PLRIs). In the thermodynamic limit case with the ELRIs, the TPE quantified by two-qubit concurrence decays exponentially along with two-site distance and the long-range concurrences can indicate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. We present a fine-grained entanglement distribution relations among the entanglement truncation length, total concurrences and two-tangles in the infinite spin chains. Moreover, in the finite XXZ chain with the more common PLRIs, the TPE decays algebraically along with the two-spin distance, and the total concurrence can exhibit a piecewise function with respect to total two-tangles. These new presented TPE distribution relations can be regarded as the generalization of Koashi-Bužek-and-Imoto bound for the long-range quantum models, and have potential applications in quantum information processing.</p>

The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step towards leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multi-method error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</p>

            <p>In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.</p>

            <p>On-chip micro-cavities with embedded quantum emitters provide an excellent platform for high-performance quantum technologies. A major difficulty for such devices is overcoming the detrimental effects of fluctuations in the device dimensions caused by the limitations of the fabrication processes. We present a fully tunable system based on a 1D photonic-crystal cavity with an embedded quantum dot, which enables tuning of both the quantum dot emission energy and the cavity mode wavelength. A micro-electromechanical cantilever is used to tune the cavity mode wavelength via index modulation and the quantum-confined Stark effect is used to tune the quantum dot emission energy, mitigating the effect of fabrication imperfections. To demonstrate the operation of the device, a maximum, voltage-controllable cavity tuning range of $\Delta \lambda = 1.8$ nm is observed. This signal is measured at the end of a bus waveguide which side-couples to the cavity, enabling the coupling of multiple cavities to a common waveguide, a key requirement for scale-up in these systems. Additionally, a quantum dot is tuned into resonance with the cavity mode, exhibiting an enhanced emission rate with a resolution limited Purcell factor of $F_P = 3.5$.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</p>

            <p>Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding complex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum algorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short circuit depth in terms of accuracy $\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all possible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space complexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important challenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general Lindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable estimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a minimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor expansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit compilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump operator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 + \lceil \log M \rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at most $M$ Pauli strings. Furthermore, the gate complexity depends on neither the number of terms in Hamiltonian nor the number of jump operators, owing to the random compilation. This work represents a significant step towards making open quantum system simulations more feasible on early fault-tolerant quantum computing devices.</p>

After that, the focus is shifted to phenomena of non-linear fields, such as the sine-Gordon model, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, false-vacuum decay, and quantum back-reaction. In order to place everything into proper context, the basic underlying mechanisms of these phenomena are briefly recapitulated before their simulators are discussed.

            <p>Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the current work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding BBGKY hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the ZNE method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE we obtain an average reduction of the error by 18.2% and 52.8% for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panpan Li, Jing Qian, Weiping Zhang</p>
            <p>To transport high-quality quantum state between two distant qubits through one-dimensional spin chains, the perfect state transfer (PST) method serves as the first choice, due to its natively perfect transfer fidelity that is independent of the system dimension. However, the PST requires a precise modulation of the local pulse parameters as well as an accurate timing of dynamic evolution, and is thus very sensitive to variations in practice. Here, we propose a protocol for achieving quantum-preserved transport of excitations using an array of Rydberg-dressed atoms, enabled by optimal control of minimally global parameters. By treating the weak coupling of two marginal array atoms as a perturbation, an effective spin-exchange model with highly tunable interactions between the external weak and the inner strong driving atoms can be established, which allows for coherent excitation transfer even with large atomic position fluctuation. We furthermore show that the existence of long-time excitation propagation unattainable for systems under antiblockade facilitation conditions. Our results highlight an easily-implemented scheme for studying the dynamics of spin systems using Rydberg atoms and may guide the avenue to the engineering of complex many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum squeezed states, with reduced quantum noise, have been widely utilized in quantum sensing and quantum error correction applications. However, generating and manipulating these nonclassical states with a large squeezing degree typically requires strong nonlinearity, which inevitably induces additional decoherence that diminishes the overall performance. Here, we demonstrate the generation and amplification of squeezed states in a superconducting microwave cavity with weak Kerr nonlinearity. By subtly engineering an off-resonant microwave drive, we observe cyclic dynamics of the quantum squeezing evolution for various Fock states |N> with N up to 6 in displaced frame of the cavity. Furthermore, we deterministically realize quantum squeezing amplification by alternately displacing the Kerr oscillator using the Trotterization technique, achieving a maximum squeezing degree of 14.6 dB and squeezing rate of 0.28 MHz. Our hardware-efficient displacement-enhanced squeezing operations provide an alternative pathway for generating large squeezed states, promising potential applications in quantum-enhanced sensing and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rostislav Arkhipov, Mikhail Arkhipov, Nikolay Rosanov</p>
            <p>Unipolar light pulses with a non-zero electric area due to the unidirectional action on charged particles can be used for the ultrafast control of the properties of quantum systems. To control atomic properties in an efficient way, it is necessary to vary the temporal shape of the pulses used. This has led to the problem of obtaining pulses of an unusual shape, such as a rectangular one. A number of new phenomena, not possible with conventional multi-cycle pulses, were discovered by analyzing the interaction of such unipolar pulses with matter. These include the formation of dynamic microcavities at each resonant transition of a multilevel medium when such pulses collide with the medium. In this work, we compare the behavior of dynamic microcavities in a two-level and a three-level medium when unipolar pulses of unusual shape (rectangular) are collided with the medium. We do this on the basis of the numerical solution of the system for the density matrix of the medium and the wave equation for the electric field. Medium parameters correspond to atomic hydrogen. It is shown that for rectangular pulses in a three-level medium, the dynamics of the cavities can be very different from the two-level model, as opposed to pulses of other shapes (e.g. Gaussian shape). When the third level of the medium is taken into account, the self-induced transparency-like regime disappears. Differences in the dynamics of resonators in a three-level medium are revealed when the pulses behave like 2{\pi} pulses of self-induced transparency.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced detection of quantum correlations via extracted work for quantum illumination and secure communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Gündogan, Mehmet Emre Taşgın</p>
            <p>We study the measurement of two-mode quantum correlations in the context of quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum illumination (QI) through the detection of extracted work. We first observe that the extracted work, in units of $k_B T$, is identical for a two-mode squeezed thermal state (TMSTS) and a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSVS). However, TMSTS exhibits $\bar{n}_{\rm th}$ times greater resistance to channel noise compared to TMSVS. We demonstrate that using TMSTS enhances the extracted work, joint-detection signal-to-noise ratio in QI, and correlation coefficients for QKD by approximately $\bar{n}_{\rm th}$ times relative to initializing the idler-signal system with a TMSVS. These findings highlight the potential of TMSTS for improving correlation detection in quantum protocols, with significant implications for noise resilience in QI and QKD.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Wu, Dongfanghao Zhu, Yunhan Wang, Xing Rong, Jiangfeng Du</p>
            <p>The energy level degeneracies, also known as exceptional points (EPs), are crucial for comprehending emerging phenomena in materials and enabling innovative functionalities for devices. Since EPs were proposed over half a century age, only two types of EPs have been experimentally discovered, revealing intriguing phases of materials such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals. These discoveries have showcased numerous exotic topological properties and novel applications, such as unidirectional energy transfer. Here we report the observation of a novel type of EP, named the Dirac EP, utilizing a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Two of the eigenvalues are measured to be degenerate at the Dirac EP and remain real in its vicinity. This exotic band topology associated with the Dirac EP enables the preservation of the symmetry when passing through, and makes it possible to achieve adiabatic evolution in non-Hermitian systems. We examined the degeneracy between the two eigenstates by quantum state tomography, confirming that the degenerate point is a Dirac EP rather than a Hermitian degeneracy. Our research of the distinct type of EP contributes a fresh perspective on dynamics in non-Hermitian systems and is potentially valuable for applications in quantum control in non-Hermitian systems and the study of the topological properties of EP.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kewei Sun, Maxim Gelin, Kaijun Shen, Yang Zhao</p>
            <p>We offer a theoretical perspective on simulation and engineering of polaritonic conical-intersection-driven singlet-fission (SF) materials. We begin by examining fundamental models, including Tavis-Cummings and Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonians, exploring how disorder, non-Hermitian effects, and finite temperature conditions impact their dynamics, setting the stage for studying conical intersections and their crucial role in SF. Using rubrene as an example and applying the numerically accurate Davydov-Ansatz methodology, we derive dynamic and spectroscopic responses of the system and demonstrate key mechanisms capable of SF manipulation, viz. cavity-induced enhancement/weakening/suppression of SF, population localization on the singlet state via engineering of the cavity-mode excitation, polaron/polariton decoupling, collective enhancement of SF. We outline unsolved problems and challenges in the field, and share our views on the development of the future lines of research. We emphasize the significance of careful modeling of cascades of polaritonic conical intersections in high excitation manifolds and envisage that collective geometric phase effects may remarkably affect the SF dynamics and yield. We argue that microscopic interpretation of the main regulatory mechanisms of polaritonic conical-intersection-driven SF can substantially deepen our understanding of this process, thereby providing novel ideas and solutions for improving conversion efficiency in photovoltaics.</p>

            <p>Quantum double models provide a natural framework for realising anyons by manipulating a lattice of qudits, which can be directly encoded in quantum simulators. In this work, we consider a lattice of $d=6$ qudits that give rise to $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{S}_3)$ non-Abelian anyons. We present a method that demonstrates the non-commutativity of the braiding and fusion evolutions solely by utilising the operators that create and measure anyons. Furthermore, we provide a dense coding scheme where only two qudits are sufficient to determine the anyonic braiding and fusion matrices. The minimal resource requirement of our approach offers a viable blueprint for demonstrating the non-Abelian nature of anyons in various quantum platforms, including optical, atomic, and solid-state systems, where higher-spin states can be effectively encoded. This work represents a foundational step towards the realisation of non-Abelian quantum error-correcting codes.</p>

We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Lindblad many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio M. García-García, Zhongling Lu, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a hybrid bidirectional controlled quantum communication protocol between two parties, initiated by a Mentor. Initially, the two main parties and the controller do not share a common quantum entanglement; instead, each party shares entanglement separately with the Mentor. The Mentor's actions create entanglement among the two parties and the controller. The protocol operates deterministically in the absence of environmental noise. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of various types of noises on the protocol, calculate the fidelity, and study how fidelity varies with different parameters. We also provide a theoretical description of the generation of the initial entangled channel used in the protocol. The quantum circuits for entanglement generation and also of the entire protocol are presented. To verify the protocol, these quantum circuits are executed on a real IBM quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Reassessing the boundary between classical and nonclassicalfor individual quantum processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujie Zhang, David Schmid, Yìlè Yīng, Robert W. Spekkens</p>
            <p>There is a received wisdom about where to draw the boundary between classical and nonclassical for various types of quantum processes. For instance, for multipartite states, it is the divide between separable and entangled, for channels, the divide between entanglement-breaking and not, for sets of measurements, the divide between compatible and incompatible, and for assemblages, the divide between steerable and unsteerable. However, no unified justification of these placements of the classical-nonclassical divide has been proposed. That is, although each might be motivated by some notion of what it means to be classically explainable, it is not the same notion for all of them. One well-motivated notion of classical explainability is the one based on generalized noncontextuality: a set of circuits is classically explainable if the statistics they generate can be realized by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. In this work, we show that this notion can be leveraged to define a classical-nonclassical divide for individual quantum processes of arbitrary type. A set of measurements is judged to be classical if and only if a particular set of circuits -- the one obtained by contracting these measurements with every possible quantum state -- is classically explainable in the sense just articulated. We begin the task of characterizing where the classical-nonclassical divide lies according to this proposal for a variety of different types of processes. In particular, we show that all of the following are judged to be nonclassical: every entangled state, every set of incompatible measurements, every non-entanglement-breaking channel, every steerable assemblage. However, it also judges certain subsets of the complementary classes to be nonclassical, i.e., certain separable states, compatible sets of measurements, entanglement-breaking channels, and unsteerable assemblages.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Schrodinger bridges: large deviations and time-symmetric ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olga Movilla Miangolarra, Ralph Sabbagh, Tryphon T. Georgiou</p>
            <p>Quantum counterparts of Schrodinger's classical bridge problem have been around for the better part of half a century. During that time, several quantum approaches to this multifaceted classical problem have been introduced. In the present work, we unify, extend, and interpret several such approaches through a classical large deviations perspective. To this end, we consider time-symmetric ensembles that are pre- and post-selected before and after a Markovian experiment is performed. The Schrodinger bridge problem is that of finding the most likely joint distribution of initial and final outcomes that is consistent with obtained endpoint results. The derived distribution provides quantum Markovian dynamics that bridge the observed endpoint states in the form of density matrices. The solution retains its classical structure in that density matrices can be expressed as the product of forward-evolving and backward-evolving matrices. In addition, the quantum Schrodinger bridge allows inference of the most likely distribution of outcomes of an intervening measurement with unknown results. This distribution may be written as a product of forward- and backward-evolving expressions, in close analogy to the classical setting, and in a time-symmetric way. The derived results are illustrated through a two-level amplitude damping example.</p>

            <p>The goal of benchmarking is to determine how far the output of a noisy system is from its ideal behavior; this becomes exceedingly difficult for large quantum systems where classical simulations become intractable. A common approach is to turn to circuits comprised of elements of the Clifford group (e.g., CZ, CNOT, $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ gates), which probe quantum behavior but are nevertheless efficient to simulate classically. However, there is some concern that these circuits may overlook error sources that impact the larger Hilbert space. In this manuscript, we show that for a broad class of error models these concerns are unwarranted. In particular, we show that, for error models that admit noise tailoring by Pauli twirling, the diamond norm and fidelity of any generic circuit is well approximated by the fidelities of proxy circuits composed only of Clifford gates. We discuss methods for extracting the fidelities of these Clifford proxy circuits in a manner that is robust to errors in state preparation and measurement and demonstrate these methods in simulation and on IBM Quantum's fleet of deployed heron devices.</p>

Our numerical results show that the performance of quantum circuits for quantum support vector machines can be characterized by dimensionality-reduced molecular fingerprints as well as by the size of the largest and smallest Gershgorin circles derived from the Coulomb matrices of the corresponding molecules. This can be used to restrict the search space for the compositional optimization of quantum circuits. We show that a high accuracy of a quantum algorithm can be achieved with high probability by sampling from a specific set of molecules. This work implies that quantum ansatz optimization can benefit from advances in cheminformatics and suggests an approach to identify key elements that enhance the accuracy of a quantum algorithm by mapping quantum circuits onto molecules and exploring correlations between physical properties of molecules and circuit performance.</p>

            <p>Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) and an extended protocol known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) have emerged as promising algorithms to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation with noisy quantum computers. In QSCI/SQD a quantum circuit is repeatedly prepared on the quantum device, and measured configurations form a subspace of the many-body Hilbert space in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized classically. For the dissociation of N$_2$ and a model $\mathrm{[2Fe-2S]}$ cluster (correlating 10 electrons in 26 orbitals and 30 electrons in 20 orbitals, respectively) we show that a non-perturbative stochastic approach, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), using truncated SQD trial wavefunctions obtained from quantum hardware can recover a substantial amount (e.g., O(100) mHa) of correlation energy and alleviate the possible sampling redundancy of the QSCI/SQD procedure. Extrapolation of the ph-AFQMC energy versus the energy variance of the SQD trial wavefunctions has the potential to further improve the energy accuracy.</p>

            <p>We show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose lattice quantum cellular automata theories derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space but a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the quantum cellular automaton theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of quantum cellular automata, and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of quantum cellular automata seems to require a nonzero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.</p>

            <h2>Digital Zero-Noise Extrapolation with Quantum Circuit Unoptimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske, Vincent Russo</p>
            <p>Quantum circuit unoptimization is an algorithm that transforms a quantum circuit into a different circuit that uses more gate operations while maintaining the same unitary transformation. We demonstrate that this method can implement digital zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a quantum error mitigation technique. By employing quantum circuit unoptimization as a form of circuit folding, noise can be systematically amplified. The key advantages of this approach are twofold. First, its ability to generate an exponentially increasing number of distinct circuit variants as the noise level is amplified, which allows noise averaging over many circuit instances with slightly different circuit structure which mitigates the effect of biased error propagation because of the significantly altered circuit structure from quantum circuit unoptimization, or highly biased local noise on a quantum processor. Second, quantum circuit unoptimization by design resists circuit simplification back to the original unmodified circuit, making it plausible to use ZNE in contexts where circuit compiler optimization is applied server-side. We evaluate the effectiveness of quantum circuit unoptimization as a noise-scaling method for ZNE in two test cases using depolarizing noise numerical simulations: random quantum volume circuits, where the observable is the heavy output probability, and QAOA circuits for the (unweighted) maximum cut problem on random 3-regular graphs, where the observable is the cut value. We show that using quantum circuit unoptimization to perform ZNE can approximately recover signal from noisy quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>The advancement of classical machine learning is inherently linked to the establishment and progression of classical dataset. In quantum machine learning (QML), there is an analogous imperative for the development of quantum entangled datasets comprised with huge quantity and high quality.

This paper is dedicated to provide a method for generating mixed-state datasets for entangled-separable classification tasks. This method is based on supervised quantum machine learning and the concentratable entanglement measures. It furthers the assembly of quantum entangled datasets, inspires the discovery of new entanglement criteria with both classical and quantum machine learning, and provides a valuable resource for benchmarking QML models, thereby opening new avenues for exploring the rich structure of quantum entanglement in mixed states.

            <h2>Weak-coupling bound states in semi-infinite topological waveguide QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Savannah Garmon, Gonzalo Ordonez, Kenichi Noba</p>
            <p>A striking feature of cavity quantum electrodynamics is the existence of atom-photon bound states, which typically form when the coupling between the atom and its environment are strong enough that after de-excitation the atom can ``grab'' an emitted photon and re-absorb it, resulting in a virtual cloud surrounding the atom. Here we will demonstrate the existence of bound states that instead form in the case of weak coupling. Specifically, we show that when a quantum emitter is weakly coupled to a structured reservoir exhibiting topologically-protected surface states, hybridizations between these states and the emitter can form, resulting in mid-gap bound states. We illustrate this using a semi-infinite extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as our reservoir. First, we diagonalize the bare semi-infinite SSH chain and reveal a winding number that predicts only the edge state on the finite side of the chain survives the semi-infinite extension. Then, after coupling the quantum emitter to this end of the chain, we analyze the modified emitter spectrum and reveal the existence of bound states in three parameter regions. Two of these represent the usual strong-coupling bound states, while the third gives the weak-coupling bound states with eigenvalue appearing in the SSH band gap and which exhibit partial sublattice localization. We demonstrate that oscillations between the weak-coupling bound states can be used to transfer the particle from the emitter into the lattice in a predictable and reversible manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miaomiao Wei, Huatang Tan</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present a scheme for remotely generating large-size motional Schrödinger cat states in cavity optomechanical (OM) systems with non-Gaussian quantum steering of continuous variables. We consider that the output field from the OM cavity undergoes three typical kinds of multiphoton operations: multiphoton subtraction, multiphoton addition, or multiphoton catalysis, followed by homodyne detection. We first demonstrate that these multiphoton operations can lead to non-Gaussian OM quantum steerable correlations, which are unveiled by the subsequent homodyne detection with a Fisher-information-based steering criterion. It is found that the non-Gaussian steering is obviously enhanced with an increasing number $n$ of photons in the multiphoton operations, which, as we show, fails to be revealed with the well-known Reid's steering criterion. It therefore suggests that the Fisher-information-based criterion is more effective for witnessing non-Gaussian quantum steering. We next show that the strong OM steering enables the remote preparation of large-size Schrödinger odd or even cat states of the mechanical oscillator by the homodyne detection. Accordingly, the amplitudes of the cat states also increase significantly with the photon number $n$, particularly in the cases of multiphoton subtraction and addition. Our results reveal the properties of non-Gaussian steering generated by multiphoton operations, and the large cat states of macroscopic mechanical resonators hold promise for fundamental tests in quantum mechanics and practical applications in quantum science.</p>

            <p>When a high-energy particle, such as a $\gamma$-ray or muon, impacts the substrate of a superconducting qubit chip, large numbers of electron-hole pairs and phonons are created. The ensuing dynamics of the electrons and holes changes the local offset-charge environment for qubits near the impact site. The phonons that are produced have energy above the superconducting gap in the films that compose the qubits, leading to quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting ground state when the phonons impinge on the qubit electrodes. An elevated density of quasiparticles degrades qubit coherence, leading to errors in qubit arrays. Because these pair-breaking phonons spread throughout much of the chip, the errors can be correlated across a large portion of the array, posing a significant challenge for quantum error correction. In order to study the dynamics of $\gamma$-ray impacts on superconducting qubit arrays, we use a $\gamma$-ray source outside the dilution refrigerator to controllably irradiate our devices. By using charge-sensitive transmon qubits, we can measure both the offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning due to the $\gamma$ irradiation at different doses. We study correlations between offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning for different qubits in the array and compare this with numerical modeling of charge and phonon dynamics following a $\gamma$-ray impact. We thus characterize the poisoning footprint of these impacts and quantify the performance of structures for mitigating phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Loizeau, Berislav Buča, Dries Sels</p>
            <p>Solving short and long time dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems is one of the main challenges of both atomic and condensed matter physics. For locally interacting closed systems, the dynamics of local observables can always be expanded into (pseudolocal) eigenmodes of the Liouvillian, so called dynamical symmetries. They come in two classes - transient operators, which decay in time and perpetual operators, which either oscillate forever or stay the same (conservation laws). These operators provide a full characterization of the dynamics of the system. Deriving these operators, apart from a very limited class of models, has not been possible. Here, we present a method to numerically and analytically derive some of these dynamical symmetries in infinite closed systems by introducing a naturally emergent open boundary condition on the Krylov chain. This boundary condition defines a partitioning of the Krylov space into system and environment degrees of freedom, where non-local operators make up an effective bath for the local operators. We demonstrate the practicality of the method on some numerical examples and derive analytical results in two idealized cases. Our approach lets us directly relate the operator growth hypothesis to thermalization and exponential decay of observables in chaotic systems.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Monitoring of Multimode Squeezing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Kalash, Aditya Sudharsanam, M. H. M. Passos, Valentina Parigi, Maria Chekhova</p>
            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Controlling the flow of heat in quantum systems or circuits is very desirable for the development of quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the quantum heat transport in a driven hybrid magnonphoton system in contact with two thermal baths operating at different temperatures. Specifically, we analyze the role of the parameters of the hybrid quantum system in the processes that lead to the asymmetry of the steady-state heat current. We find that the thermal rectification is high in the regime of weak magnon-photon hybridization strength and large magnon-drive. Moreover, this driving and the system parameters could serve as experimental knobs to tune the thermodynamic properties of the magnon-photon system, as we demonstrate for the rectification parameter tunable by the drive in its entire physical range. The results from this research would provide very useful insight into the design of quantum thermal machines with a driven magnon-photon system.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Matrix Product States in the Heisenberg Picture: Projectivity, Ergodicity, and Mixing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdessatar Souissi, Amenallah Andolsi</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a Heisenberg picture approach to Matrix Product States (MPS), offering a rigorous yet intuitive framework to explore their structure and classification. MPS efficiently represent ground states of quantum many-body systems, with infinite MPS (iMPS) capturing long-range correlations and thermodynamic behavior. We classify MPS into projective and non-projective types, distinguishing those with finite correlation structures from those requiring ergodic quantum channels to define a meaningful limit. Using the Markov-Dobrushin inequality, we establish conditions for infinite-volume states and introduce ergodic and mixing MPS. As an application, we analyze the depolarizing MPS, highlighting its lack of finite correlations and the need for an alternative ergodic description. This work deepens the mathematical foundations of MPS and iMPS, providing new insights into entanglement, phase transitions, and quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirko Poljak</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection. Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to host MZMs. We employ eigenspectra analysis and quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states, transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</p>

            <h2>Time- and frequency-resolved dynamics of resonant two-photon terahertz quantum cascade lasers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder</p>
            <p>Two-photon terahertz (THz) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) can immensely improve the conventional applications of THz frequency sources and open windows to new applications due to their ability to generate quantum-entangled twin photon beams. The rich intrinsic non-linearity in a two-photon THz QCL arises from cascaded photon transitions, leading to time-resolved and frequency-resolved dynamics that are less predictable. This work investigates the time- and frequency-resolved dynamics of a resonant two-photon THz QCL by numerically solving the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations. Our findings indicate that the output intensity is significantly higher, and the emission spectra are much broader in a two-photon THz QCL than in a conventional one-photon THz QCL. Additionally, a pronounced Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) instability onsets for a resonant two-photon QCL at a smaller pumping current. We also observe an increase in the number of lasing modes, as well as a higher power per line in a resonant two-photon QCL. Furthermore, Rabi splitting is observed in the emission spectra at high pumping currents.</p>

            <p>Accelerating quantum dynamical simulations with quantum computing has received considerable attention but remains a significant challenge. In variational quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics, designing an expressive and shallow-depth parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is a key difficulty. Here, we proposed a multi-set variational quantum dynamics algorithm (MS-VQD) tailored for nonadiabatic dynamics involving multiple electronic states. MS-VQD employs multiple PQCs to represent the electronic-nuclear coupled wavefunction, with each circuit adapting to the motion of nuclear wavepacket on a specific potential energy surface. By simulating excitation energy transfer dynamics in molecular aggregates described by the Frenkel-Holstein model, we demonstrated that MS-VQD achieves the same accuracy as traditional VQD while requiring significantly shallower PQCs. Notably, its advantage increases with the number of electronic states, making it suitable for simulating nonadiabatic quantum dynamics in complex molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>On the Minimum Distances of Finite-Length Lifted Product Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nithin Raveendran, David Declercq, Bane Vasić</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is critical for practical realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing, and recently proposed families of quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code are prime candidates for advanced QEC hardware architectures and implementations. This paper focuses on the finite-length QLDPC code design criteria, specifically aimed at constructing degenerate quasi-cyclic symmetric lifted-product (LP-QLDPC) codes. We describe the necessary conditions such that the designed LP-QLDPC codes are guaranteed to have a minimum distance strictly greater than the minimum weight stabilizer generators, ensuring superior error correction performance on quantum channels. The focus is on LP-QLDPC codes built from quasi-cyclic base codes belonging to the class of type-I protographs, and the necessary constraints are efficiently expressed in terms of the row and column indices of the base code. Specifically, we characterize the combinatorial constraints on the classical quasi-cyclic base matrices that guarantee construction of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes. Minimal examples and illustrations are provided to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the code construction approach. The row and column partition constraints derived in the paper simplify the design of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes and can be incorporated into existing classical and quantum code design approaches.</p>

            <p>We present a software tool-set which combines the theoretical, optimal control view of quantum devices with the practical operation and characterization tasks required for quantum computing. In the same framework, we perform model-based simulations to create control schemes, calibrate these controls in a closed-loop with the device (or in this demo \textemdash by emulating the experimental process) and finally improve the system model through minimization of the mismatch between simulation and experiment, resulting in a digital twin of the device. The model based simulator is implemented using TensorFlow, for numeric efficiency, scalability and to make use of automatic differentiation, which enables gradient-based optimization for arbitrary models and control schemes. Optimizations are carried out with a collection of state-of-the-art algorithms originated in the field of machine learning. All of this comes with a user-friendly Qiskit interface, which allows end-users to easily simulate their quantum circuits on a high-fidelity differentiable physics simulator.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Chernoff divergence in advantage distillation for quantum key distribution and device-independent quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikka Stasiuk, Norbert Lütkenhaus, Ernest Y.-Z. Tan</p>
            <p>Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) aims to mitigate adversarial exploitation of imperfections in quantum devices, by providing an approach for secret key distillation with modest security assumptions. Advantage distillation, a two-way communication procedure in error correction, has proven effective in raising noise tolerances in both device-dependent and device-independent QKD. Previously, device-independent security proofs against IID collective attacks were developed for an advantage distillation protocol known as the repetition-code protocol, based on security conditions involving the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, there exists a gap between the sufficient and necessary security conditions, which hinders the calculation of tight noise-tolerance bounds based on the fidelity. We close this gap by presenting an alternative proof structure that replaces the fidelity with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a distinguishability measure that arises in symmetric hypothesis testing. Working in the IID collective attacks model, we derive matching sufficient and necessary conditions for the repetition-code protocol to be secure (up to a natural conjecture regarding the latter case) in terms of the quantum Chernoff divergence, hence indicating that this serves as the relevant quantity of interest for this protocol. Furthermore, using this security condition we obtain some improvements over previous results on the noise tolerance thresholds for DIQKD. Our results provide insight into a fundamental question in quantum information theory regarding the circumstances under which DIQKD is possible.</p>

            <h2>Violation of Diagonal Non-Invasiveness: A Hallmark of Non-Classical Memory Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrián A. Budini</p>
            <p>An operational (measurement based) scheme that connects measurement invasiveness and the presence of non-classical memory effects in open quantum systems is defined. Its underlying theoretical basis relies on a non-invasive measurability of (memoryless) quantum Markovian dynamics when the corresponding observable is diagonal in the same basis as the system density matrix. In contrast, violation of this property can be related to intrinsic non-classical memory effects. Related conditions for violation of Leggett-Garg inequality due to quantum memory effects emerge from this perspective. The developed approach applies to open quantum dynamics whose time-evolution is derived from a full unitary (microscopic) description, stochastic Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as for a broad class of non-unitary system-environment models (bipartite Lindblad equations).</p>

The complexity is computed using a two-qubit quantum circuit obtained from canonically purifying the mixed state. We demonstrate that the Nielson complexity for the unitary evolution oscillates around a mean circuit depth of $k$. Further, the complexity of the step-wise evolution operator grows cumulatively and linearly with the steps. From a quantum circuit perspective, this implies a succession of circuits of (near) constant depth to be applied to reach the final state.</p>

            <p>In a nonlocal game, two noncommunicating players cooperate to convince a referee that they possess a strategy that does not violate the rules of the game. Quantum strategies allow players to optimally win some games by performing joint measurements on a shared entangled state, but computing these strategies can be challenging. We present a variational quantum algorithm to compute quantum strategies for nonlocal games by encoding the rules of a nonlocal game into a Hamiltonian. We show how this algorithm can generate a short-depth optimal quantum strategy for a graph coloring game with a quantum advantage. This quantum strategy is then evaluated on fourteen different quantum hardware platforms to demonstrate its utility as a benchmark. Finally, we discuss potential sources of errors that can explain the observed decreased performance of the executed task and derive an expression for the number of samples required to accurately estimate the win rate in the presence of noise.</p>

            <p>We initiate the study of utilizing Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) to solve optimization problems, particularly those non-convex objective functions that present substantial obstacles for traditional gradient descent algorithms. Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically, we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent QLD by making temperature and $\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.</p>

            <p>Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lewis W. Anderson, Martin Kiffner, Tom O'Leary, Jason Crain, Dieter Jaksch</p>
            <p>Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{O}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{O}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</p>
