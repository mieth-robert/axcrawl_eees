            <h2>Tunable quantum Mpemba effect in long-range interacting systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Hallam, Matthew Yusuf, Aashish A. Clerk, Ivar Martin, Zlatko Papić</p>
            <p>Symmetry plays a fundamental role in many-body systems, both in and out of equilibrium. The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems initially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in terms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically restored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ model with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field. In the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system develops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when interactions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between the external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We systematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on the effective temperature set by the initial state. Our results demonstrate the tunability of the QME via long-range interactions, which can be probed in experimental platforms of trapped ions, polar molecules, and NV centers.</p>

            <h2>Many-body post-processing of density functional calculations using the variational quantum eigensolver for Bader charge analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Schultheis, Alexander Rehn, Gabriel Breuil</p>
            <p>Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. Further, estimating properties of a material is crucial to evaluate its industrial applications. To investigate charge distributions of weakly and strongly correlated systems we calculate Bader charges for various periodic systems by solving many-body Hamiltonians using the variational quantum eigensolver. The Hamiltonians are computed from Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate the accuracy of our method on various doped MgH2 supercells. Further, we show that our approach, compared to standard DFT, significantly improves the Bader charge values for strongly correlated transition metal oxides, where we take DFT+U results as a reference. The computational framework behind our many-body calculations, called Dopyqo, is made openly available as a software package.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Key Distribution in the Iberian Peninsula</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vicky Domínguez Tubío, Mario Badás Aldecocea, David L. Bakker, Gustavo C. Amaral, Diego López, Johannes Borregaard</p>
            <p>A promising use of quantum networking is quantum key distribution (QKD), which can provide information-theoretic security unattainable by classical means. While optical fiber-based QKD networks suffer from exponential loss, satellite-assisted quantum communication offers a scalable solution for long-distance secure key exchange. In this work, we propose and evaluate a satellite-based QKD setup covering the Iberian Peninsula, linking Madrid with Barcelona, Bilbao, and Lisbon. Our proposed setup uses a Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) state-of-the-art satellite equipped with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source to distribute entangled photon pairs to ground stations. Considering vibrations in the satellite, we optimize the beam waist to enhance the transmission probability and improve the secret key rate (SKR). Our results show that key rates sufficient for real-world applications, such as secure communication between hospitals, using hybrid classical-quantum protocols are feasible with existing protocols. Our results highlight the viability of near-term satellite-based QKD networks for national-scale secure communications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiromichi Nakazato, Saverio Pascazio</p>
            <p>We analytically derive the exact -- though formal -- master equation for a two-level quantum system (qubit) interacting with a bosonic environment within the rotating-wave approximation, assuming the environment is initially in an arbitrary thermal state. The long-time behavior of the evolution operator governing the dynamics of both the system and the environment is analyzed, and the conditions under which the system approaches thermal equilibrium are examined.</p>

            <h2>Autler-Townes spectroscopy of a Rydberg ladder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai Xiang, Yue-Hui Lu, Jacquelyn Ho, Tsai-Chen Lee, Zhenjie Yan, Dan M. Stamper-Kurn</p>
            <p>Ladder-type two-photon excitation of an atom from a ground state $|g\rangle$, to an intermediate excited state $|e\rangle$, and, finally, to a Rydberg state $|r\rangle$, has a variety of uses from quantum information to sensing. A common scheme for detecting this transition optically is through electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, in inverted wavelength schemes, where the ground-to-excited transition wavelength is shorter than the excited-to-Rydberg transition wavelength, the strength of the EIT feature on the lower-leg beam is strongly reduced in a Doppler-broadened medium. Here, we report on an alternative two-photon spectroscopic feature, which we term the two-photon Autler-Townes resonance, observed on the upper-leg beam. Compared to the EIT signal, this feature's superior signal-to-noise ratio allows one to resolve Rydberg resonances with principal quantum number as high as $n=80$. We also show that such a feature can be utilized to generate an error signal for stabilizing the frequency of the upper-leg beam.</p>

            <h2>Homodyne Measurement of a Non-Hermitian Qubit Undergoing Fluorescence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roson Nongthombam, Amarendra K. Sarma</p>
            <p>Implementation of a two-level non-Hermitian qubit via postselection of a three-level system has been demonstrated. The postselection procedure, which discards quantum jump to the ground-state manifold while retaining excitations in the first and second excited-state manifolds, effectively generates a non-Hermitian qubit exhibiting PT symmetry. In this work, we perform continuous homodyne mea- surement of this non-Hermitian qubit and analyze the interplay between decay introduced by posts- election and measurement backaction. We compare the ensemble-averaged dynamics obtained from measurement trajectories with the the Liouvillian average. We formulate the no-jump stochastic differential equation describing the postselected non-Hermitian qubit and show that its ensemble- averaged dynamics agree with those of the jump-updated postselected evolution at drive strengths far from the Liouvillian exceptional point (EP). The degree of deviation near the EP depends sensitively on the nature of the drive. This discrepancy is attributed to the interplay between measurement backaction and the non-Hermitian decay introduced by postselection. Furthermore, we determine the optimal path of the non-Hermitian qubit by extremizing the action within the path-integral formulation of the quantum trajectory framework Our results provide insights into how measurement backaction and non-Hermitian dynamics together shape the transient behavior of open quantum systems and enable controlled manipulation of qubits near exceptional points.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermal diode with additional control by auxiliary atomic states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qin Zhang, Zi-chen Zhang, Yi-jia Yang, Zheng Liu, Chang-shui Yu</p>
            <p>A quantum thermal diode, similar to an electronic diode, allows for unidirectional heat transmission. In this paper, we study a quantum thermal diode composed of two two-level atoms coupled to auxiliary two-level atoms. We find that the excited auxiliary atoms can weaken heat current and enhance the rectification effect, but the ground-state auxiliary atoms can enhance heat current and weaken the rectification effect. The more auxiliary atoms are coupled, the stronger the enhancing or weakening impact is. If the auxiliary atom is in a superposition state, we find that only the fraction that projects onto the excited state plays a significant role. In particular, if we properly design the coupling of the auxiliary atoms, the rectification effect can be eliminated. This provides the potential to control the heat current and the rectification performance by the states of the auxiliary atoms.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid light-matter boundaries of graphene in a chiral cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Volker Karle, Oriana K. Diessel, Vasil Rokaj, Ceren B. Dağ</p>
            <p>Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels in next-generation quantum-optical devices.</p>

            <h2>High-efficiency and long-distance quantum memory-assisted device-independent quantum secret sharing with single photon sources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhang, Jia-Wei Ying, Shi-Pu Gu, Xing-Fu Wang, Ming-Ming Du, Wei Zhong, Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng</p>
            <p>Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a critical role in building the distributed quantum networks. Device-independent (DI) QSS provides the highest security level for QSS. However, the photon transmission loss and extremely low multipartite entanglement generation rate largely limit DI QSS's secure photon transmission distance (less than 1 km) and practical key generation efficiency. To address the above drawbacks, we propose the quantum memory-assisted (QMA) DI QSS protocol based on single photon sources (SPSs). The single photons from the SPSs are used to construct long-distance multipartite entanglement channels with the help of the heralded architecture. The heralded architecture enables our protocol to have an infinite secure photon transmission distance in theory. The QMA technology can not only increase the multi-photon synchronization efficiency, but also optimize the photon transmittance to maximize the construction efficiency of the multipartite entanglement channels. Our protocol achieves the practical key generation efficiency seven orders of magnitude higher than that of the existing DI QSS protocols based on cascaded spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and six orders of magnitude higher than that of the DI QSS based on SPSs without QMA. Our protocol has modular characteristics and is feasible under the current experimental technical conditions. Combining with the advanced random key generation basis strategy, the requirement on experimental devices can be effectively reduced. Our protocol is expected to promote the development of long-distance and high-efficiency DI quantum network in the future.</p>

            <h2>Back-reflection in dipole fields and beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maksim Valialshchikov, Felix Karbstein, Daniel Seipt, Matt Zepf</p>
            <p>Quantum reflection is a fascinating signature of the quantum vacuum that emerges from inhomogeneities in the electromagnetic fields. In pursuit of the prospective real-world implementation of quantum reflection in the back-reflection channel, we provide the first numerical estimates for the light-by-light scattering with dipole pulses, which are known to provide the tightest focusing of light possible. For an all-optical setup with a dipole pump and Gaussian probe of the same frequency, we find that the dominant signal signature is related mainly to the back-reflection channel from 4-wave mixing. Focusing on this, we study the particular case of a multiple focusing pulses configuration (belt configuration) as an approximation to the idealized dipole pulse. Using Bayesian optimization methods, we determine optimal parameters that maximize the detectability of a discernible back-reflection signal. Our study indicates that the optimization favors a three-beam collision setup, which we further investigate both numerically and analytically.</p>

            <h2>Open Quantum Dynamics Theory for Coulomb Potentials: Hierarchical Equations of Motion for Atomic Orbitals (AO-HEOM)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yankai Zhang, oshitaka Tanimura</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of Coulomb potential systems in thermal baths. We study these systems within the framework of open quantum dynamics theory, focusing on preserving the rotational symmetry of the entire system, including the baths. Thus, we employ a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model to derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion for atomic orbitals (AO-HEOM) that enable a non-perturbative and non-Markovian treatment of system-bath interactions at finite temperatures. To assess the formalism, we calculated the linear absorption spectrum of an atomic system under isotropic thermal environment, with systematic variation of system-bath coupling strength and temperature.</p>

            <h2>Superradiance and Superabsorption Engine of $N$ Two-Level Systems: $N^{2}$-Power Scaling at Near-Unity Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. F. Alves da Silva, H. Sanchez, M. A. Ponte, M. H. Y. Moussa, Norton G. de Almeida</p>
            <p>We present a thermal engine that exploits the \emph{cooperative superradiance} and \emph{superabsorption} of a sample of \(N\) two-level atoms. This engine operates using a single cold reservoir via cycles of collective pumping followed by decay. Using an effective mean-field Hamiltonian to describe the many-body dynamics, we design optimized drive pulses that preserve adiabaticity and achieve an average power output scaling quadratically with the system size, \(P \propto N^2\). An experimentally measurable figure of merit demonstrates that the efficiency of this superengine can approach unity. The resulting analytical model, which yields a representative Hamiltonian for the sample within the mean-field formalism, is validated by numerical simulations. Our results pave the way for scalable and highly efficient quantum heat engines based on collective effects.</p>

            <p>The coherent emission of multiple atoms gives rise to superradiance, a cornerstone phenomenon in quantum optics with wide-ranging applications in quantum information processing and precision metrology. Despite its importance, how the superradiant scaling with respect to the number of participating atoms can be effectively controlled remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate a cavity-QED system and demonstrate that atom-photon coupling can significantly alter the emission behavior--suppressing the collective superradiant scaling while enhancing the scaling associated with individual atomic emissions. Our study provides a pathway toward controllable collective emission in state-of-the-art experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Experimental verification of multi-copy activation of genuine multipartite entanglement</h2>

            <p>A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is, correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</p>

            <h2>Trajectory-Protected Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Šoda, Pierre-Antoine Graham, T. Rick Perche, Gurpahul Singh</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel method that simultaneously isolates a quantum computer from decoherence and enables the controlled implementation of computational gates. We demonstrate a quantum computing model that utilizes a qubit's motion to protect it from decoherence. We model a qubit interacting with a quantum field via the standard light-matter interaction model: an Unruh-DeWitt detector, i.e., the qubit, follows a prescribed classical trajectory while interacting with a scalar quantum field. We switch off the rotating-wave terms, i.e., the resonant transitions, using the technique of acceleration-induced transparency which eliminates the dominant decoherence channels by controlling the qubit's trajectory. We are able to perform one-qubit gates by stimulating the counter-rotating wave terms (i.e., the non-resonant transitions) and two-qubit gates by extracting the entanglement from the quantum field prepared in a squeezed state. Finally, we discuss the fundamental limits on quantum error protection: on the trade-off between isolating a quantum computer from decoherence, and the speed with which entangling gates may be applied, comparable to the Eastin-Knill theorem for quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable and versatile light-matter interfaces with practical application in magnetic field sensing, offering the ability to operate at room temperature and reach sensitivities below pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We propose an approach to simultaneously probe all of the magnetically sensitive states using a broadband microwave field and demonstrate that it can be used to measure the external DC magnetic field strength with sensitivities below 1~nT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We develop tools for analyzing the temporal signatures in the transmitted broadband microwaves to estimate the magnetic field, comparing maximum likelihood estimation based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to various neural network models, and both methods independently reach practical sensitivities. These results are achieved without optimizing parameters such as the bandwidth, power, and shape of the probing microwave field such that, with further improvements, sensitivities down to $\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ can be envisioned. Our results motivate novel implementations of NV-based magnetic sensors with the potential for vectorial magnetic field detection at 1-10 kHz update rates and improved sensitivities without requiring a bias magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable spin defects with great potential for nanoscale quantum sensing. A key application of NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among metals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and electrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies. However, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their quantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered diamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with different energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum properties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the NV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a result, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be efficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we observed a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum thin films. Our study describes the various processes affecting NV centers near platinum films and provides guidance for the integration of thin metal films with near-surface NV centers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum teleportation over thermal microwave network</h2>

            <p>Quantum communication in the microwave regime is set to play an important role in distributed quantum computing and hybrid quantum networks. However, typical superconducting quantum circuits require millikelvin temperatures for operation, which poses a significant challenge for largescale microwave quantum networks. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating the successful quantum teleportation of microwave coherent states between two spatially-separated dilution refrigerators over a thermal microwave channel in the temperature range up to $4$ K. We distribute two-mode squeezed states over this noisy channel and employ the resulting quantum entanglement for quantum teleportation of coherent states with fidelities of $72.3 \pm 0.5 ~\%$ at $1$ K and $59.9 \pm 2.5 \%$ at $4$ K, exceeding the no-cloning and classical communication thresholds, respectively. We successfully model the teleportation protocol using a Gaussian operator formalism that includes losses and noise. Our analysis shows that the teleportation infidelity mainly stems from a parasitic heating of the cold quantum nodes due to the hot network connection. These results demonstrate the experimental feasibility of distributed superconducting architectures and motivate further investigations of noisy quantum networks in various frequency regimes.</p>

By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$ wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local \textit{extra recoil} effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</p>

            <p>We introduce the spin coherence scale as a measure of quantum coherence for spin systems, generalizing the quadrature coherence scale (QCS) previously defined for quadrature observables. This SU($2$)-invariant measure quantifies the off-diagonal coherences of a quantum state in angular momentum bases, weighted by the classical distinguishability of the superposed states. It serves as a witness of nonclassicality and provides both upper and lower bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the set of classical (spin coherent) states. We demonstrate that many hallmark properties of the QCS carry over to the spin setting, including its links to noise susceptibility of a state and moments of quasiprobability distributions. The spin coherence scale has direct implications for quantum metrology in the guise of rotation sensing. We also generalize the framework to SU($n$) systems, identifying the unique SU($n$)-invariant depolarization channel and outlining a broad, Lie-algebraic approach to defining and characterizing the properties of coherence scale beyond harmonic oscillators.</p>

            <h2>Vari-Cool: a non-unitary quantum variational protocol for simulated cooling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey Z. Song, Gilad Kishony, Erez Berg, Mark S. Rudner</p>
            <p>We introduce a variational approach for preparing low energy states of arbitrary target Hamiltonians. The protocol is defined in terms of a repeated cycle consisting of p layers of unitary gates applied to the system and ancilla "bath" qubits, followed by reset of the bath qubits. The gate parameters within each cycle are optimized such that the steady state achieved after many cycles has a low energy expectation value with respect to the target Hamiltonian, and that the energy converges toward the steady state value in as few cycles as possible. We illustrate the protocol for the transverse field Ising model, and study its systematic behaviors with respect to system size, model parameters, and noise using tensor network based classical simulations. We then experimentally demonstrate its operation on IBM's ibm_kingston quantum processor for up to 28 system qubits coupled to 14 bath sites. Classical training on small system sizes and with few unitary layers per cycle gives robust results that transfer well to larger system sizes and to noisy hardware.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Emulation of Neutral Atom Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kemal Bidzhiev, Stefano Grava, Pablo le Henaff, Mauro Mendizabal, Elie Merhej, Anton Quelle</p>
            <p>Simulating the dynamics of neutral atom arrays is a challenging problem. To address this, we introduce two emulators, emu-sv and emu-mps, as computational backends for Pasqal's pulser package. Emu-sv is designed for high-precision state-vector simulations, giving the possibility to emulate systems of up to $\thicksim 27$ qubits on an A100 40GB GPU, making it perfect for cases where numerically exact results are needed. In contrast, emu-mps uses a Matrix Product State representation and other controlled approximations to efficiently simulate much larger arrays of atoms with manageable errors. We show through benchmark comparisons that both emulators provide significant speed-ups over generic solvers such as QuTiP. In addition, we provide practical guidance on choosing between the two emulators. These quantum software tools are designed to support researchers and developers aiming to simulate quantum systems either as a precursor to full hardware implementation or as a means of benchmarking hardware performance.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Action-Dependent Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Korenberg, Uzi Pereg</p>
            <p>We study the quantum action-dependent channel. The model can be viewed as a quantum analog of the classical action-dependent channel model. In this setting, the communication channel has two inputs: Alice's transmission and the input environment. The action-dependent mechanism enables the transmitter to influence the channel's environment through an action channel. Specifically, Alice encodes her message into a quantum action, which subsequently affects the environment state. For example, a quantum measurement at the encoder can induce a state collapse of the environment. In addition, Alice has access to side information. Unlike the classical model, she cannot have a copy of the environment state due to the no-cloning theorem. Instead, she shares entanglement with this environment. We establish an achievable communication rate for reliable message transmission via the quantum action-dependent channel, thereby extending the classical action-dependent framework to the quantum domain.</p>

            <h2>Observational entropy of quantum correlations and entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Rossetti, Stefano Mancini, Andreas Winter, Joseph Schindler</p>
            <p>The use of coarse graining to connect physical and information theoretic entropies has recently been given a precise formulation in terms of ``observational entropy'', describing entropy for observers with respect to a measurement. Here we consider observers with various locality restrictions, including local measurements (LO), measurements based on local operations with classical communication (LOCC), and separable measurements (SEP), with the idea that the ``entropy gap'' between the minimum locally measured observational entropy and the von Neumann entropy quantifies quantum correlations in a given state. After introducing entropy gaps for general classes of measurements and deriving their general properties, we specialize to LO, LOCC, SEP and other measurement classes related to the locality of subsystems. For those, we show that the entropy gap can be related to well-known measures of entanglement or non-classicality of the state (even though we point out that they are not entanglement monotones themselves). In particular, for bipartite pure states, all of the ``local'' entropy gaps reproduce the entanglement entropy, and for general multipartite states they are lower-bounded by the relative entropy of entanglement. The entropy gaps of the different measurement classes are ordered, and we show that in general (mixed and multipartite states) they are all different.</p>

            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor(SC-SM) nanowires remain one of the foremost platforms for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes(MZMs) towards fault-tolerant topological qubits, especially with the rapid development of artificial Kitaev chains. In contrast to the widely used aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of ~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance, identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap, thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially larger topological gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Zeming, Tan Naiming, Gao Chao, Yao Zhihai, Wang Xiaoqian</p>
            <p>The quantum Cheshire cat effect is an important phenomenon in quantum mechanics that reveals the separability of physical properties from their carriers. This effect transcends the classical framework whose attributes must be inherently attached to objects, providing new perspectives for quantum information and precision measurement. According to the quantum Cheshire cat effect, we prepare a pre-selected state of a spin1/2 atomic system composed of two particles through a pre-selection process. We conduct quantum weak measurements on the spins and positions of these two atoms and extract weak values by using the method of imaginary time evolution(ITE). Subsequently, we perform post-selection on these two atoms and design two distinct post-selected states. Initially, we calculate analytical solutions when both atoms encounter these two different post-selected states separately. We also compare the analytical and numerical solutions. Our research theoretically confirms the feasibility of fermionic systems within bipartite quantum Cheshire cat effects and illustrates how delayed-choice influences quantum Cheshire cat effects in spin-1/2 atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum synchronization (QS) in open many-body systems offers a promising route for controlling collective quantum dynamics, yet existing manipulation schemes often rely on dissipation engineering, which distorts limit cycles, lacks scalability, and is strongly system-dependent. Here, we propose a universal and scalable method for continuously tuning QS from maximal synchronization under isotropic interactions to complete synchronization blockade (QSB) under fully anisotropic coupling in spin oscillator networks. Our approach preserves intrinsic limit cycles and applies to both few-body and macroscopic systems. We analytically show that QS arises solely from spin flip-flop processes and their higher-order correlations, while anisotropic interactions induce non-synchronizing coherence. A geometric QS measure reveals a macroscopic QSB effect in the thermodynamic limit. The proposed mechanism is experimentally feasible using XYZ interactions and optical pumping, and provides a general framework for programmable synchronization control in complex quantum networks and dynamical phases of matter.</p>

            <p>The monogamy of quantum correlations is a fundamental principle in quantum information processing, limiting how quantum correlations can be shared among multiple subsystems. Here we propose a theoretical scheme to investigate the monogamy of quantum steering and genuine tripartite entanglement in a hybrid qubit-cavity optomagnonic system with a coherent feedback loop. Using logarithmic negativity and Gaussian quantum steering, we quantify entanglement and steerability, respectively. We verify the CKW-type monogamy inequalities which leads to steering monogamous through adjustments of the reflective parameter among three tripartite modes versus temperature. Our results show that a coherent feedback loop can enhance entanglement and quantum steering under thermal effects.</p>

            <p>Quantum radar has emerged as a promising paradigm that utilizes entanglement and quantum correlations to overcome the limitations of classical detection in noisy and lossy environments. By exploiting microwave entanglement generated from superconducting devices such as Josephson parametric amplifiers, converters, and traveling-wave parametric amplifiers, quantum radar systems can achieve enhanced detection sensitivity, lower error probabilities, and greater robustness against thermal noise and jamming. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the field, beginning with the theoretical foundations of quantum illumination and extending to the generation of entanglement in the microwave regime. We then examine key quantum radar subsystems, including quantum transducers, amplification chains, and receiver architectures, which form the backbone of practical designs. Recent experimental systems are surveyed in the microwave domain, highlighting proof-of-principle demonstrations and their transition from conceptual frameworks to laboratory realizations. Collectively, the progress reviewed here demonstrates that quantum radar is evolving from a theoretical construct to a practical quantum technology capable of extending the performance boundaries of classical radar.</p>

In this work, we propose a scheme to investigate the nonreciprocity of bi- and tripartite entanglement and generate squeezed states in a magnomechanical system. This is achieved through the Barnett effect, which originates from the rotation of the first magnon mode. The system consists of two YIG spheres, each supporting a magnon mode that represents collective spin motion, positioned inside a microwave cavity (MC). We show that the Barnett effect enhances entanglement under thermal effects and generates squeezed states for the two magnon modes and the photon mode. Moreover, we show that magnon-magnon coupling enhances entanglement between different two modes.</p>

The second is based on the combination of three consecutive measurements and was originally developed to increase the measurement range of the quantum sensor beyond its linear range. After comparing their performances using synthetic data, we implement them on acceleration data collected in a recent airborne campaign and evaluate the bias and the scale factor error of the classical sensor. We then extend their scope to the dynamical evaluation of other key measurement parameters (e.g. alignment errors). We demonstrate an improvement in the correlation between the two accelerometers' measurements and a significant reduction of the error in the estimation of the bias of the classical sensor.</p>

            <p>We present an experimental implementation of the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) no-go theorem on IBM's 156-qubit Heron2 Marrakesh superconducting quantum processor. By preparing qubits in a set of non-orthogonal states and evolving them under carefully compiled unitary circuits, we test whether one can interpret the hidden variable model for quantum states as merely epistemic -- reflecting ignorance about some underlying physical reality. To account for realistic hardware imperfections, we derive noise-aware error tolerance based on decoherence models calibrated to the device's performance. Our results show that a significant majority of adjacent qubit pairs and adjacent five-qubit configurations yield outcome statistics that violate the epistemic bound, thus ruling out the epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we observe a clear trend: the probability of passing the PBR test decreases as the spatial separation within the quantum processor between qubits increases, highlighting the sensitivity of this protocol to connectivity and coherence in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. These results demonstrate the PBR test as a promising device-level benchmark for quantumness in the presence of realistic noise.</p>

            <p>Diamonds containing color centers have recently gathered significant attention for photonic quantum technologies, including quantum sensing, photonic quantum computers, and quantum networks. Among the various color centers, tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are particularly promising due to the high emission efficiency from the zero-phonon line and due to their long spin coherence times. However, the extraction of photons from diamond remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate high photon extraction from a single SnV center incorporated in a diamond nanopillar with tapered sidewalls and a multi-cone structure. A sharp emission peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $6\,$nm was observed at a wavelength of $619\,$nm. Furthermore, the second-order correlation function exhibited an antibunching dip well below $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.5$, indicating single-photon emission. Remarkably, the emitter achieved a high saturation count rate of approximately $9\,$Mcps. These results establish our nanopillar platform as a promising candidate for bright and stable quantum sources and sensors based on SnV centers in diamond.</p>

            <p>Strongly correlated photons play a crucial role in modern quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the probability of generating strongly correlated photons in a chain of N qubits coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide. We found that disorder in the transition frequencies can induce photon antibunching, and especially nearly perfect photon blockade events in the transmission and reflection outputs. As a comparison, in ordered chains, strongly correlated photons cannot be generated in the transmission output, and only weakly antibunched photons are found in the reflection output. The occurrence of nearly perfect photon blockade events stems from the disorder-induced near completely destructive interference of photon scattering paths. Our work highlights the impact of disorder on photon correlation generation and suggests that disorder can enhance the potential for achieving strongly correlated photon.</p>

            <p>Quantum memories are essential components of quantum networks, enabling synchronization, quantum repeaters, and long-distance entanglement distribution. Most ensemble-based realizations rely on dark-state polaritons (DSPs) in $\Lambda$-type systems that operate at near-infrared wavelengths, such as 795 nm in $^{87}$Rb, far from the telecom band where long fiber transmission is optimal. Here we identify a DSP in $^{87}$Rb that coherently couples two photonic modes at 795 nm and 1324 nm through a shared spin-wave coherence. We derive its field operator and group velocity, extending the Fleischhauer-Lukin model to a dual-wavelength regime, and formulate a memory protocol enabling bidirectional storage and retrieval between the two modes. Numerical simulations of the full six-level dynamics confirm two-way storage and retrieval for both same-mode and cross-mode operation between the two wavelengths. The results demonstrate a dual-wavelength memory that unifies node-band and telecom-band operation within a single ensemble, providing a potential route toward frequency-conversion-free quantum-network interfaces.</p>

            <p>Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces of nature. However, high-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is notoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation offers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly probed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and long-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a high-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the initial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to rapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to long distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be explained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma oscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the way to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate a lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma oscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of predictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework encompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of the plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics of a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum simulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of isolated quantum systems following a sudden quench plays a central role in many areas of material science, high-energy physics, and quantum chemistry. Featuring complex phenomena with implications for thermalization, non-equilibrium phase transitions, and Floquet phase engineering, such far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics is challenging to study numerically, in particular, in high-dimensional systems. Here, we use a programmable neutral atom quantum simulator to systematically explore quench dynamics in spin models with up to 180 qubits. By initializing the system in a product state and performing quenches across a broad parameter space, we discover several stable, qualitatively distinct dynamical regimes. We trace their robustness to Floquet-like prethermal steady states that are stabilized over long emergent timescales by strong dynamical constraints. In addition, we observe sharp peaks in the dynamical response that are quantitatively explained by the structured melting of prethermalization through resonances. In two dimensions, we uncover a sharp dynamical response change that converges with increased system size, that is linked to the proliferation of Néel-order defects and indicative of a dynamical phase transition with no equilibrium analogs. Uncovering an intricate interplay between quantum prethermalization and emergent dynamical phases, our results demonstrate the use of quantum simulators for revealing complex non-equilibrium quantum many-body phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Neural PDE Solvers with Physics Constraints: A Comparative Study of PINNs, DRM, and WANs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiakang Chen</p>
            <p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks (WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schrödinger equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the study to a laser-driven case of Schrödinger's equation via the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation. Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs), forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning, network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case, indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks. We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible, scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.</p>

            <p>Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on quantum computers.</p>

Here we present a step toward such a hybrid system: using an industrially manufactured silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) spin qubit to detect electronic spin transitions of an ensemble of TbPc$_2$ molecules. The readout is based on a compact and robust protocol that applies a microwave pulse while all gate voltages defining the qubit are held at a fixed operating point. This protocol, which combines simultaneous Rapid adiabatic Passage and Spin- Selective tunneling (RPSS), enables high-contrast resonance detection and avoids repeated $\pi$-pulse recalibration common in decoupling schemes. By demonstrating ensemble detection, we establish a foundation for integrating molecular quantum memories with industrial qubit platforms and mark an important step toward single-molecule hybrid quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emanuele Costa, Axel Pérez-Obiol, Javier Menéndez, Arnau Rios, Artur García-Sáez, Bruno Juliá-Díaz</p>
            <p>Quantum computing is emerging as a promising tool in nuclear physics. However, the cost of encoding fermionic operators hampers the application of algorithms in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we analyze an encoding scheme based on pairing nucleon modes. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of the encoding, while maintaining a high accuracy for the ground states of semimagic nuclei across the $sd$ and $pf$ shells and for tin isotopes. In addition, we also explore the encoding ability to describe open-shell nuclei within the above configuration spaces. When this scheme is applied to a trotterized quantum adiabatic evolution, our results demonstrate a computational advantage of up to three orders of magnitude in CNOT gate count compared to the standard Jordan-Wigner encoding. Our approach paves the way for efficient quantum simulations of nuclear structure using quantum annealing, with applications to both digital and hybrid quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Time-diffracting 2D wave vortices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boris A. Khanikati, Konstantin Y. Bliokh</p>
            <p>Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to phase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract in both space and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely in time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, as well as examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices.</p>

            <p>The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar A. M. Abdelraouf</p>
            <p>Integrated and tunable light sources are critical for advancing quantum nanophotonic chips in quantum computing, communications, and sensing. However, efficient and tunable emission amplification post-fabrication poses major challenges. Hybrid metasurfaces combining niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), copper indium sulfide (CIS) quantum dots or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) as a low-loss phase-change material offer a compelling solution for dynamic control and amplification of photoluminescence and quantum light emission. In this work, we report an active hybrid metasurface supporting tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances in the visible regime, achieving experimental Q-factors up to 206 and strong amplification of CIS QDs photoluminescence as well as quantum light emission of hBN single-photon emitters. The metasurface enables BIC resonance shifts of 33.5 nm in the visible spectrum via phase transition of Sb2S3, and 17 nm through dimensional parametric tuning. We experimentally demonstrate highly directional photoluminescence amplification up to 33-fold, alongside broad tunable amplified PL emission upon Sb2S3 phase modulation. Furthermore, we propose amplified, tunable, and on-demand strong coupling of hBN single-photon emitters with the tunable BIC metasurface for next-generation broadband quantum nanophotonic chips. This work sets a new benchmark in reconfigurable nanophotonic platforms for efficient quantum light sources in integrated photonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ines Safi</p>
            <p>We derive a novel fluctuation--dissipation theorem (FDT) valid for nonequilibrium initial states that imprint the braiding of anyons in the time domain. The derivation is carried out within the Unifying Nonequilibrium Perturbative Theory (UNEPT), which applies to both standard reservoir geometries and configurations with one or two quantum point contacts (QPCs) injecting dilute anyonic fluxes. Based on this FDT, we propose complementary methods to determine the time-domain braiding phase. The first method relates the DC backscattering noise to the integral of the current with respect to DC drives, while the second connects the AC current phase shift to the DC noise. The latter provides a particularly robust probe of the statistical angle $\theta$, offering an intrinsic calibration and cancelling certain nonuniversal renormalization effects. Specializing to a thermalized Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL), we further show that in the quantum regime the phase shift enables a direct determination of the scaling dimension $\delta$ when $\delta > 1/2$. These results define experimentally accessible schemes to extract either $\theta$ or $\delta$ in minimal single-QPC setups, without relying on interferometry or cross-correlation measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Sun, Syed A. Jafar</p>
            <p>A distributed quantum storage code maps a quantum message to N storage nodes, of arbitrary specified sizes, such that the stored message is robust to an arbitrary specified set of erasure patterns. The sizes of the storage nodes, and erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed quantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative to the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message and all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the decoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized for various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and intersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a classical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize non-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the corresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly non-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information inequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum entropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs.</p>

            <p>We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Partha Nandi, Partha Ghose, Francesco Petruccione</p>
            <p>Spin networks in loop quantum gravity provide a kinematical picture of quantum geometry but lack a natural mechanism for dynamical Dirac-type evolution, while the Wheeler--DeWitt equation typically enters only as an imposed constraint. We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.</p>

            <p>The observation of gravitational waves has opened a new window into the Universe through gravitational-wave astronomy. However, high-frequency gravitational waves remain undetected. In this work, we propose that spin systems can be employed to detect gravitational waves in this unexplored frequency regime.

We focus on nuclear spins and utilize nuclear magnetic resonance to enhance the gravitational response, leveraging the advantages of long coherence time, high polarization, and a small gyromagnetic ratio. The proposed experimental scheme is capable of probing gravitational waves in the kilohertz to gigahertz range, with projected sensitivities reaching $\sqrt{S_h}\approx10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mainak Dutta, Partha Nandi, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi</p>
            <p>A central challenge in probing the quantum nature of gravity is to distinguish effects that are genuinely quantum from those that can be explained classically. In this work, we study how quantized gravitational waves interact with thermal quantum systems, modeled as harmonic oscillators. We show that, unlike classical waves, quantized gravitons generate entanglement and leave behind a persistent ``graviton-induced quantum memory'' even after the wave has passed. This effect is further shaped by the presence of thermal noise, which does not simply wash out quantum correlations but can in fact amplify them in distinctive ways. Our analysis reveals clear signatures - such as nonlinear thermal corrections and a prethermal time-crystal-like phase-that cannot arise from any classical treatment. These results identify experimentally relevant markers of gravitons and provide a framework for exploring how finite-temperature environments may help uncover the quantum nature of gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matic Orel, Marko Robnik</p>
            <p>We investigate eigenstate localization in the phase space of the Bunimovich mushroom billiard, a paradigmatic mixed-phase-space system whose piecewise-$C^{1}$ boundary yields a single clean separatrix between one regular and one chaotic region. By varying the stem half-width $w$, we continuously change the strength and extent of bouncing-ball stickiness in the stem, which for narrow stems gives rise to phase space localization of chaotic eigenstates. Using the Poincaré-Husimi (PH) representation of eigenstates we quantify localization via information entropies and inverse participation ratios of PH functions. For sufficiently wide stems the distribution of entropy localization measures converges to a two-parameter beta distribution, while entropy localization measures and inverse participation ratios across the chaotic ensemble exhibit an approximately linear relationship. Finally, the fraction of mixed (neither purely regular nor fully chaotic) eigenstates decays as a power-law in the effective semiclassical parameter, in precise agreement with the Principle of Uniform Semiclassical Condensation of Wigner functions (PUSC).</p>

The graph based structure is machine-friendly and supports powerful pattern matching based compilation techniques. Inspired by MLIR, HUGR's extensibility further allows compilation tooling to reason about programs at multiple levels of abstraction, lowering smoothly between them. Safety guarantees in the structure including strict, static typing and linear quantum types allow rapid development of compilation tooling without fear of program invalidation.

In this work, we introduce a universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space.

This representation is both exact and minimal: the number of required features scales as $D\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\sim N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network solvers for many-electron systems.</p>

            <p>A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra- and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 136 $\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.</p>

            <p>The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics to study strongly correlated effects. However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.</p>

            <p>We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.</p>

            <p>Communication over a quantum multiple-access channel (MAC) with cribbing encoders is considered, whereby Transmitter 2 performs a measurement on a system that is entangled with Transmitter 1. Based on the no-cloning theorem, perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios, Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2's cribbing may inflict a "state collapse" for Transmitter 1. Achievable regions are derived for each setting. Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the channel input. Building on the analogy between the noisy cribbing model and the relay channel, a partial decode-forward region is derived for a quantum MAC with non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum MAC with cribbing encoders, the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input, and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing. In the special case of a classical-quantum MAC with a deterministic cribbing channel, the inner and outer bounds coincide.</p>

Due to its fundamental importance, it is natural to ask whether it is an intrinsic quantum property or whether it also holds for a broader class of non-classical theories. To address this question, one could use the framework of correlation scenarios. Under this standpoint, Joshi, Grudka, and Horodecki$^{\otimes 4}$ conjectured that one cannot locally broadcast nonlocal behaviours. In this paper, we prove their conjecture based on the monotonicity of the relative entropy for behaviours. Additionally, following a similar reasoning, we obtain an analogous no-go theorem for steerable assemblages.</p>

Here, exploring a generalized communication scenario, we introduce a framework for input-dependent local quantum state discrimination, which we call local random authentication (LRA). We report that impossibility of LRA certifies the presence of entangled states in the ensemble, a feature absent from erstwhile nonlocality arguments based on local state discrimination. Additionally, we explore the salient features of this state discrimination prototype for arbitrary set of orthogonal quantum states and compare them with the traditional notion of local quantum state discrimination.

In this paper, we propose a new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results: 1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination. Here, the sample complexity is measured given sample access to the quantum state to be tested, while the query complexity is measured given query access to an oracle that block-encodes the quantum state. 2. A matching lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gilyén, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal. 3. A new lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023). 4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015, Comm. Math. Phys. 2021). In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems.

We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</p>

            <h2>The discrete adiabatic quantum linear system solver has lower constant factors than the randomized adiabatic solver</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro C.S. Costa, Dong An, Ryan Babbush, Dominic Berry</p>
            <p>The solution of linear systems of equations is the basis of many other quantum algorithms, and recent results provided an algorithm with optimal scaling in both the condition number $\kappa$ and the allowable error $\epsilon$ [PRX Quantum \textbf{3}, 040303 (2022)]. That work was based on the discrete adiabatic theorem, and worked out an explicit constant factor for an upper bound on the complexity. Here we show via numerical testing on random matrices that the constant factor is in practice about 1,200 times smaller than the upper bound found numerically in the previous results. That means that this approach is far more efficient than might naively be expected from the upper bound. In particular, it is about an order of magnitude more efficient than using a randomised approach from [arXiv:2305.11352] that claimed to be more efficient.</p>

            <h2>Error Correction in Dynamical Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esther Xiaozhen Fu, Daniel Gottesman</p>
            <p>We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.</p>

            <h2>Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Yang</p>
            <p>Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.</p>

            <h2>Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Srivastav, Vivek Pandey, Brij Mohan, Arun Kumar Pati</p>
            <p>Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space are generally unattainable for a wide class of dynamics and it is difficult to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we present two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty relations for operators acting on Liouville space, and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. We also obtain the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal CPTP dynamics that connect the given initial and target states. To illustrate our findings, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. In another important application, we show that our results can help us understand the counter-intuitive phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics, as the minimal relaxation time scale obtained by speed limits is dictated by the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a novel authenticated Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol employing maximally entangled qubit pairs. In the absence of noise, we securely authenticate the well-known BB84 QKD scheme under two assumptions: first, adversaries cannot simultaneously access preshared and non-pre-shared secret classical information, and second, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre-shared secret classical information and quantum memories held by legitimate parties. The main strength of this noiseless result is that access to all secretly pre-shared classical information is insufficient for breaching our scheme. Additionally, our protocol desirably allows for pre-shared secrecy reusage, leading to secret key growing. In order to address noise, we simulate a photonic implementation of our scheme, together with a storage model that aims to replicate the performance of cavity-enhanced Atomic- Frequency Comb (AFC) memories. Two methods are used to distinguish authentic entities from forgery attempts: on the one hand, a statistical approach is used after calibration of its defining parameter $\mu$. Alternatively, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is designed and trained to learn the underlying different structure of that input data coming from adversaries in comparison to that one coming from legitimate parties. Both methods achieve a correct classification rate larger than 0.80 for memory storage time of 150 $\mu$s and a 1 km distance between parties.</p>

            <p>Tomographic locality is a principle commonly used in the program of finding axioms that pick out quantum theory within the landscape of possible theories. The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory -- which can be classical, quantum or post-quantum -- and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to the collective action of that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds. We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic nonlocality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks can enhance both security and privacy conditions for multi-user communication, delegated computation, and distributed sensing tasks. An example quantum protocol is private parameter estimation (PPE) where only the aggregate information is accessible while individual sensor data remain confidential. Specifically, the protocol enables the estimation of a global function of remote sensor parameters without revealing local parameters to any entity. We implement the PPE protocol by distributing a three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, among three sensors, which is verified using stabilizer measurements to establish privacy and precision bounds for the sensing task. We demonstrate Heisenberg-limited precision scaling of the global parameter while suppressing the metrological information of the local parameters by up to three orders of magnitude. This work, which integrates privacy in distributed quantum sensing, marks a crucial step towards developing advanced quantum-secure-and-private protocols in complex quantum networks.</p>

We first describe the principle of the algorithm from a theoretical point of view. We provide a detailed pseudo-code of the algorithm, on which we elaborate preliminary elements for a complexity analysis to highlight some of its scaling properties. We apply our algorithm to a set of examples, running on emulators and real hardware showcasing its applicability across diverse sets of differential equations.

            <h2>Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> András Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo</p>
            <p>We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).</p>

            <h2>Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the lower bound on the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the lower bound on the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive fundamental precision limits, dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectations of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are set by quantities such as dimensions and energy bandwidth, which depend only on the initial configuration and are independent of the dynamics. Using a quantum battery model, the fundamental precision limits show that there is a trade-off between the amount of energy storage and the charging precision. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental limits, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can improve the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.</p>

            <p>TThe organization and structure of bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) are more complex and less well understood compared to bipartite pure-state QE. Bipartite mixed-state QEs and their measures play a crucial role in both theory and practical applications. Some existing measures involve quantifying the minimum QE and reflect the inherently complex nature of their computation, while others are only applicable to highly limited-dimensional quantum systems. In this context, we propose a method termed Reduction-induced Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy to quantify QE in any bipartite states, particularly focusing on bipartite mixed states. Partial Von Neumann Entropy is merely a special case of this method,Its intuitive and clear physical representation, along with easy computation and wide applicability, facilitates exploring its potential applications. Furthermore, we present examples to demonstrate the superiorities of this method in identifying bipartite QE by comparing with other existing bipartite mixed-state QE measures through both their physical implications and mathematical structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qile Su, Rodrigo G. Cortiñas, Jayameenakshi Venkatraman, Shruti Puri</p>
            <p>The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily with the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator), whose energy barrier can be increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a step-like decrease termed the "staircase". The view challenged by the experiment demands a deep review of our understanding of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical formula for the switching rate that resolves a continuous transition between tunneling- and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat and the steep parts of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: dephasing and decay. This allows us to predict the critical drive amplitudes where steps occur. In addition, we show that in the regime of a few states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, however, the perturbation induced by the nonhermitian Hamiltonian becomes important and facilitates a new form of quantum heating. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</p>

            <p>A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d>4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0<\alpha<3d/2$. For $\alpha<d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d<\alpha<d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s>4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.</p>

In our scheme, not only the direction and types of the bipartite steering, but also different situations of multipartite steering, can be manipulated effectively, by adjusting the pump proportions with a spatial light modulator. In addition, stricter genuine pentapartite steering (only one site is trusted) can also be achieved by making the pump proportions as balanced as possible. Our scheme is versatile and experimentally feasible and offers new insights into the manipulation of steering, especially multipartite steering, which is valuable in many special quantum tasks.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum function secret sharing scheme in which the communication is exclusively classical. In this primitive, a classical dealer distributes a secret quantum circuit $C$ by providing shares to $p$ quantum parties. The parties on an input state $\ket{\psi}$ and a projection $\Pi$, compute values $y_i$ that they then classically communicate back to the dealer, who can then compute $\lVert \Pi C|\psi\rangle\rVert^2$ using only classical resources. Moreover, the shares do not leak much information about the secret circuit $C$. Our protocol for quantum secret sharing uses the {\em Cayley path}, a tool that has been extensively used to support quantum primacy claims. More concretely, the shares of $C$ correspond to randomized version of $C$ which are delegated to the quantum parties, and the reconstruction can be done by extrapolation. Our scheme has two limitations, which we prove to be inherent to our techniques: First, our scheme is only secure against single adversaries, and we show that if two parties collude, then they can break its security. Second, the evaluation done by the parties requires exponential time in the number of gates.</p>

[Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)], replacing the use of classical shadows. While the original QC-AFQMC showed high accuracy for quantum chemistry calculations, it required exponentially costly post-processing. Subsequent work using Matchgate shadows [Commun. Math. Phys. 404, 629 (2023)] improved scalability, but still suffers from prohibitive computational requirements that limit practical applications. Our QC-CBT-AFQMC approach uses shallow Clifford circuits with a quadratic reduction of two-qubit gates over the original algorithm, significantly reducing computational requirements and enabling accurate calculations under limited measurement budgets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and nitrogen molecule, producing potential energy curves that closely match established benchmarks. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques.

            <p>Trapped-ion systems are a leading platform for quantum computing. The Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate is a widely used method for implementing controlled interactions in multipartite systems. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the environment, quantum states undergo non-unitary evolution, leading to significant deviations from ideal dynamics. Common techniques such as Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) and Bell State Tomography (BST) are typically employed to evaluate MS gate performance and to characterize noise in the system. In this letter, we propose leveraging the geometric phase as a tool for performance assessment and noise identification in the MS gate. Our findings indicate that the geometric phase is particularly sensitive to environmental noise occurring around twice the clock pulse time. Given that geometric phase measurements do not require full-state tomography, this approach offers a practical and experimentally feasible method to detect entanglement and classify the nature of noise affecting the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. B. Horoshko, V. S. Shchesnovich</p>
            <p>Optical downconversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a non-depleted and non-entangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation of the downconversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. The new model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of $r\approx 1.8$ and a coherent pump amplitude of $\alpha\approx 2\cdot10^6$, can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of $\alpha \approx 2\cdot10^6$, the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds $r\approx 4.5$, whereas the new approximation remains valid up to $r\approx 6$ with an acceptable error of 1%.</p>

            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme in a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, where a mechanical resonator couples to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through diagonalization of the full system's transition matrix in the Heisenberg picture. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the framework of open quantum system. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unsteady system states. Remarkably, the squeezing level can exceed the maximum achievable under system stability conditions. Furthermore, we show that our protocol is robust against systematic errors in both driving intensity and frequency, as well as against thermal Markovian noises. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <h2>QAMA: Scalable Quantum Annealing Multi-Head Attention Operator for Deep Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Du, Jinjing Shi, Wenxuan Wang, Yin Ma, Kai Wen, Xuelong Li</p>
            <p>Attention mechanisms underpin modern deep learning, while the quadratic time and space complexity limit scalability for long sequences. To address this, Quantum Annealing Multi-Head Attention (QAMA) is proposed, a novel drop-in operator that reformulates attention as an energy-based Hamiltonian optimization problem. In this framework, token interactions are encoded into binary quadratic terms, and quantum annealing is employed to search for low-energy configurations that correspond to effective attention patterns. Unlike classical sparse or approximate attention methods that rely on hand-crafted heuristics, QAMA allows sparsity structures to emerge naturally from the optimization process. Theoretically, computational complexity is analysed through single-spin flip dynamics, providing time to solution runtime bounds that depend on the spectral properties of the annealing Hamiltonian. Empirically, evaluation on both natural language and vision benchmarks shows that, across tasks, accuracy deviates by at most 2.7 points from standard multi-head attention, while requiring only linear qubits in sequence length. Visualizations further reveal that the Hamiltonian penalty terms induce meaningful and interpretable sparsity across heads. Finally, deployment on a coherent Ising machine validates the feasibility of running QAMA on real quantum hardware, showing tangible inference-time reductions compared with classical implementations. These results highlight QAMA as a pioneering and scalable step toward integrating quantum optimization devices into deep neural architectures, providing a seamlessly integrable and hardware-compatible alternative to conventional attention mechanisms.

            <h2>Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining an optimal characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric Rényi and Petz Rényi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.</p>

            <p>The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [q-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning, Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Cornelissen, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang, QTML 2025]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We demonstrate that the worst case guarantees of these algorithms can significantly improve upon the bounds for algorithms in prior work. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcello Caleffi, Laura d'Avossa, Xu Han, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti</p>
            <p>The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. For communication at distances beyond a few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as a quantum transducer, capable of converting one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide the reader with a tutorial overview of the fundamental research challenges underlying quantum transduction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this tutorial is the first work addressing quantum transduction from a communications engineering perspective, highlighting its fundamental role within quantum network design and deployment. This analysis reveals that there exist different transduction modalities, including an unorthodox one allowing a transducer to act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in communication performance. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Teleportation in Non-equilibrium Environments and Fixed-point Fidelity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaokun Yan, Zhihai Wang, Kun Zhang, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation, a fundamental protocol in quantum information science, enables the transfer of quantum states through entangled particle pairs and classical communication channels. While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in non-equilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We apply the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics. In both bosonic and fermionic setups, the fidelity can be enhanced beyond the equilibrium values. Under specific non-equilibrium conditions, the fidelities of all input states are identical. We call it teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Notably, at the fixed-point, fidelity can also be enhanced by combining the two detuned qubits and non-equilibrium environments. These findings provide important guidance for implementing quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, while the fixed-point mechanism offers a promising pathway toward simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking Quantum Architecture Search with Surrogate Assistance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darya Martyniuk, Johannes Jung, Daniel Barta, Adrian Paschke</p>
            <p>The development of quantum algorithms and their practical applications currently relies heavily on the efficient design, compilation, and optimization of quantum circuits. In particular, parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), which serve as the basis for variational quantum algorithms~(VQAs), demand carefully engineered architectures that balance performance with hardware constraints. Despite recent progress, identifying structural features of PQCs that enhance trainability, noise resilience, and overall algorithmic performance remains an active area of research. Addressing these challenges, quantum architecture search (QAS) aims to automate the design of problem-specific PQCs by systematically exploring circuit architectures to optimize algorithmic performance, often with varying degrees of consideration for hardware constraints. However, comparing QAS methods is challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark evaluation pipeline, and the high resource demands. In this paper, we present SQuASH, the Surrogate Quantum Architecture Search Helper, a benchmark that leverages surrogate models to enable uniform comparison of QAS methods and considerably accelerate their evaluation. We present the methodology for creating a surrogate benchmark for QAS and demonstrate its capability to accelerate the execution and comparison of QAS methods. Additionally, we provide the code required to integrate SQuASH into custom QAS methods, enabling not only benchmarking but also the use of surrogate models for rapid prototyping. We further release the dataset used to train the surrogate models, facilitating reproducibility and further research.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Power Superbroadening of Spectral Line Profiles on IBM Quantum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov</p>
            <p>Power broadening refers to the widening of the spectral line profile in a two-state quantum transition as the strength of the driving field increases. This phenomenon commonly arises in continuous-wave driving when the radiation field's intensity exceeds the transition's saturation intensity and it has been extensively studied in spectroscopy. For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral response of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a rectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth shapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic for the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 020802 (2024)], in a dramatic paradigm shift, we have demonstrated experimentally that for Lorentzian-shaped pulses, the opposite effect - power narrowing - takes place: the width of the spectral profile decreases when the driving pulse amplitude increases, with a narrowing factor of as much as 10 observed. While in high-resolution spectroscopy the push is for eliminating or even inverting the power broadening, there are applications where it is used to an advantage for it facilitates off-resonance excitation. Here, we present a number of shaped pulses that exhibit power broadening much greater than that of the rectangular pulse of the same pulse area. They are grouped in two families of pulse shapes. In particular, in regard to the width of the second Rabi oscillation maximum, the quadratic pulse family shows an increase by a factor of 3.3 whereas the even-exponent pulse family exhibits an increase by a factor of more than 3.5.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Paldus Transform: Efficient Circuits with Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jędrzej Burkat, Nathan Fitzpatrick</p>
            <p>We present the Quantum Paldus Transform: an efficient quantum algorithm for block-diagonalising fermionic, spin-free Hamiltonians in the second quantisation. Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin (GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \times SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities we provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods with full gate counts for the Paldus transform, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, where a transform on $50$ spatial orbitals would require a modest $5500$ Toffoli gates. This paves the way for significant advancements in quantum simulation on quantum computers enabled by the UGA paradigm.</p>

            <p>We explore covert entanglement generation over the lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, which is a quantum-mechanical model of many practical settings, including optical, microwave, and radio-frequency (RF) channels. Covert communication ensures that an adversary is unable to detect the presence of transmissions, which are concealed in channel noise. We show that a square root law (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical communication: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more practical for physical implementation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Yao Mi, Yong-Chun Liu, Zhi Jiao Deng, Chun Wang Wu, Ping Xing Chen</p>
            <p>Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Furthermore, a concrete experimental proposal based on the trapped-ion setup is provided.</p>

            <p>Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.</p>

Here we present measurements of a membrane-based opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a quantum network with reasonable averaging times.</p>

            <p>Compiling quantum circuits to account for hardware restrictions is an essential part of the quantum computing stack. Circuit compilation allows us to adapt algorithm descriptions into a sequence of operations supported by real quantum hardware, and has the potential to significantly improve their performance when optimization techniques are added to the process. One such optimization technique is reducing the number of quantum gates that are needed to execute a circuit. For instance, methods for reducing the number of non-Clifford gates or CNOT gates from a circuit is an extensive research area that has gathered significant interest over the years. For certain hardware platforms such as ion trap quantum computers, we can leverage some of their special properties to further reduce the cost of executing a quantum circuit in them. In this work we use global interactions, such as the Global Mølmer-Sørensen gate present in ion trap hardware, to optimize and synthesize quantum circuits. We design and implement an algorithm that is able to compile an arbitrary quantum circuit into another circuit that uses global gates as the entangling operation, while optimizing the number of global interactions needed. The algorithm is based on the ZX-calculus and uses an specialized circuit extraction routine that groups entangling gates into Global Mølmer-Sørensen gates. We benchmark the algorithm in a variety of circuits, and show how it improves their performance under state-of-the-art hardware considerations in comparison to a naive algorithm and the Qiskit optimizer.</p>

            <p>Unitary randomness underpins both fundamental tasks in quantum information and the modern theory of quantum chaos. On one side, a central concept is that of approximate unitary designs: circuits that look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. In a distinct setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), intensely studied as a measure of information scrambling, have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the noncommutative generalization of statistical independence. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables, while traceless observables instead require exponential resources. Indeed, local observables are precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, adding to previous literature, we show how random matrix product unitaries constitute approximate designs: we exactly compute the frame potential of the ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value with polynomial deviations and so indicating that global observables are freely independent on-average. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage and shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <p>Quantum databases open an exciting new frontier in data management by offering privacy guarantees that classical systems cannot match. Traditional engines tackle user privacy, which hides the records being queried, or data privacy, which prevents a user from learning more than she has queried. We propose a quantum database that protects both by leveraging quantum mechanics: when the user measures her chosen basis, the superposition collapses and the unqueried rows become physically inaccessible. We encode relational tables as a sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single, destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple. This allows us to preserve data privacy and user privacy at once without trusted hardware or heavyweight cryptography. Moreover, we envision a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture ready for early deployment, which ensures compatibility with the limitations of today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.</p>

Most of these new algorithms are inspired from previous classical ones, but with different pros and cons. In this Letter, we focus on the generalization of the variational principle for many-body excited-states that led to the ensemble variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We compare the performance of two ensemble VQE approaches, the equi-ensemble and weighted-ensemble ones, and conclude that the equi-ensemble is the way to go.</p>

The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center magnetometry is a highly promising quantum sensing technology, with early prototypes demonstrating impressive sensitivity in compact sensing heads. Yet, most existing implementations remain tied to laboratory setups, lacking the portability and environmental robustness needed to unlock their full potential in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a fully portable, hand-held NV-based magnetometer that delivers a vector sensitivity of approximately 400 pT/sqrt(Hz), heading errors below 5 nT in Earth's field, and a wide signal bandwidth that supports on-field recalibration and operation on moving platforms. We further demonstrate the system's technological maturity through environmental qualification such as thermal, vibration, radiation and other operational stresses related to deployment in low Earth orbit, and through successful deployments in demanding scenarios, including northern Canadian weather conditions, drone-mounted surveys and high-altitude balloon flights. Together, these achievements establish this NV-based magnetometer as a robust, versatile tool ready to bring quantum sensing performance to a broad range of field and autonomous applications.</p>

            <h2>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lane P. Hughston, Levent A. Mengütürk</p>
            <p>We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</p>

            <p>Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.</p>

            <p>Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2 times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The lack of self-correcting codes hiders the development of boson sampling to be large-scale and robust. Therefore, it is important to know the noise levels in order to cautiously demonstrate the quantum computational advantage or realize certain tasks. Based on those statistical benchmark methods such as the correlators and the clouds, which are initially proposed to discriminate boson sampling and other mockups, we quantificationally evaluate noises of photon partial distinguishability and photon loss compensated by dark counts. This is feasible owing to the fact that the output distribution unbalances are suppressed by noises, which are actually results of multi-photon interferences. This is why the evaluation performance is better when high order correlators or corresponding clouds are employed. Our results indicate that the statistical benchmark methods can also work in the task of evaluating noises of boson sampling.</p>

            <p>Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</p>

            <p>In a recent publication, Dalen, and Selstø, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 111}, 033116 (2025), it was demonstrated how converged photo electron spectra could be determined using a complex absorbing potential on a truncated numerical domain considerably smaller than the extension of the dynamical wave function. That approach required simulation until virtually all unbound parts of the wave function was absorbed, far beyond the duration of the interaction with the external field. In this work we formulate the method in a semi-analytical manner which allows us to extrapolate to infinite times after the interaction with the external field. In addition to obtaining photoelectron spectra for hydrogen differential in energy and ejection angle, we also demonstrate how -- and when -- the absorber may be seen as a detector, distorting the angular distributions when the detector is placed in the extreme vicinity of the atom.</p>

            <p>Quantum blockchains provide inherent resilience against quantum adversaries and represent a promising alternative to classical blockchain systems in the quantum era. However, existing quantum blockchain architectures largely depend on entanglement to maintain inter-block connections, facing challenges in stability, consensus efficiency, and system verification. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel quantum blockchain framework based on quantum walks, which reduces reliance on entanglement while improving stability and connection efficiency. We further propose a quantum consensus mechanism based on a weighted quantum voting protocol, which enables a fairer voting process while reflecting the weights of different nodes. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct circuit simulations to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of both the quantum walk-based block construction and the quantum voting consensus mechanism. Compared with existing entanglement-dependent approaches, our framework achieves stronger stability and enables simpler verification of block integrity, making it a practical candidate for quantum-era blockchain applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Lake</p>
            <p>We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <h2>Emergent continuous symmetry and ground-state factorization induced by long-range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Yu, Myung-Joong Hwang</p>
            <p>The spontaneous breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry typically gives rise to emergent excitations possessing the same symmetry with a renormalized mass. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we present a theory in which the low-lying excitation in the broken-symmetry phase acquires a continuous symmetry, even when the underlying symmetry of the system is discrete. In the presence of anisotropic long-range interactions, the order parameter renormalizes the relative strength of the particle-conserving and particle-nonconserving interactions. When one of the two renormalized interactions vanishes, a conservation law absent in the original Hamiltonian emerges, giving rise to a continuous symmetry. A striking consequence of the emergent continuous symmetry and conservation law is that it constrains quantum correlations in the ground-state to be zero, leading to the ground-state factorization in the presence of strong interactions. Our finding is a universal feature of quantum phase transitions in fully-connected systems and in their lattice generalizations; therefore, it can be observed in a wide range of physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k-Designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Laracuente</p>
            <p>A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1/logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1/nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.</p>

Furthermore, we show the Log-rank Conjecture holds for any non-trivial total permutation-invariant Boolean function. Moreover, we establish a relationship between the quantum/classical communication complexity and the approximate rank of permutation-invariant Boolean functions. This implies the correctness of the Log-approximate-rank Conjecture for permutation-invariant Boolean functions in both randomized and quantum settings (up to a logarithmic factor).</p>

We apply the method to compute SVL spectra of anthracene by performing wavepacket dynamics on a 66-dimensional harmonic potential energy surface constructed from density functional theory calculations. The Hagedorn approach captures both mode distortion (frequency changes) and mode mixing (Duschinsky rotation) within the harmonic approximation. We not only reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^1$ and $\overline{11}^1$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments. Notably, all spectra were obtained from the same wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for the emission spectrum from the ground vibrational level of the electronically excited state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Cheng, Tao Han, Matthew Low</p>
            <p>A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Tong Zhang, Máté Visegrádi, Jiří J. L. Vaníček</p>
            <p>Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics yields exact single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra in global harmonic models. To partially describe the effects of anharmonicity, important in the spectra of real molecules, we describe a combination of the Hagedorn wavepacket approach to SVL spectroscopy with the local harmonic approximation. In a proof-of-principle study [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010801 (2025)], we successfully demonstrated the utility of this method by computing the SVL spectra of difluorocarbene, a floppy molecule with moderately anharmonic potential. Here, we describe the theory in detail and analyse the method more thoroughly. To assess the accuracy of the method independently of electronic structure errors, we use a two-dimensional Morse-type potential for which exact quantum benchmarks are available, and show that the local harmonic approach yields more accurate results than global harmonic approximations, especially for the emission spectra from higher initial vibrational levels. Next, we compare the global and local harmonic SVL spectra of anthracene, where the more expensive local harmonic corrections turn out to be less important as long as the correct global harmonic model is used. We also present additional local harmonic results for difluorocarbene, where treating anharmonicity is essential for accurate evaluation of the spectra. Yet, we also show that the structure of the difluorocarbene spectra can be explained qualitatively (but not quantitatively) with a reduced-dimensional harmonic model, for which the spectral intensities can be evaluated analytically.</p>

Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation. Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by reexamining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</p>

            <p>Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions are able to extract accurate information about quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Chuwen Ma, Yue Yu</p>
            <p>The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schrödingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</p>

            <p>Quantum correlations in the polarization degrees of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\Delta\hat\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample -- based on a total of $3 \times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\Delta\hat\Phi$.

The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</p>

            <h2>Calibration-free single-frame super-resolution fluorescence microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anežka Dostálová, Dominik Vašinka, Robert Stárek, Miroslav Ježek</p>
            <p>Molecular fluorescence microscopy is a leading approach to super-resolution and nanoscale imaging in life and material sciences. However, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is often bottlenecked by system-specific calibrations and long acquisitions of sparsely blinking molecules. We present a deep-learning approach that reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single diffraction-limited camera frame. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data encompassing a wide range of optical and sample parameters, enabling robust generalization across microscopes and experimental conditions. Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion. By delivering unprecedented details from a single short camera exposure without prior information and calibration, our approach enables plug-and-play super-resolution imaging of fast, dense, or light-sensitive samples on standard wide-field setups.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable photonics have rapidly become an invaluable tool for information processing. Light-based computing accelerators are promising for boosting neural network learning and inference and optical interconnects are foreseen as a solution to the information transfer bottleneck in high-performance computing. In this study, we demonstrate the successful programming of a transformation implemented using a reconfigurable photonic circuit with a non-conventional architecture. The core of most photonic processors is an MZI-based architecture that establishes an analytical connection between the controllable parameters and circuit transformation. However, several architectures that are substantially more difficult to program have improved robustness to fabrication defects. We use two algorithms that rely on different initial datasets to reconstruct the circuit model of a complex interferometer, and then program the required unitary transformation. Both methods performed accurate circuit programming with an average fidelity above 98%. Our results provide a strong foundation for the introduction of non-conventional interferometric architectures for photonic information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabiano Feleppa, Gaetano Lambiase, Sunny Vagnozzi</p>
            <p>We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</p>

            <p>Universality in physics describes how disparate systems can exhibit identical low-energy behavior. Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\epsilon(k) = \text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.</p>

            <p>Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has enabled physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented accessibility. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. An intriguing theoretical prediction of a characteristic phenomenon of BECs is anomalous tunneling, whereby low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy regime, and experimentally measure these frequencies using Oqtant. Our results reveal that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs, as well as highlight the potential of cloud-based experiments in quantum-body physics.</p>

            <p>We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian, one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.</p>

            <p>In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sqrt{n}\,z^n$ for $|z|<1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty(2\pi{\rm i}n-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-{\rm e}^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion ${\rm e}^{-u}\sum_{k=0}^\infty P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. At large $k$, these polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x)R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants satisfying $R\exp({\rm i}\,C)=\sqrt{-1/(2+\pi{\rm i})}$.</p>

A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics.

            <h2>Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Pricing Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Xin</p>
            <p>Motivated by Heisenberg's observable-only stance, we replace latent "information" (filtrations, hidden diffusions, state variables) with observable transitions between price states. On a discrete price lattice with a Hilbert-space representation, shift operators and the spectral calculus of the price define observable frequency operators and a translation-invariant convolution generator. Combined with jump operators that encode transition intensities, this yields a completely positive, translation-covariant Lindblad semigroup. Under the risk-neutral condition the framework leads to a nonlocal pricing equation that is diagonal in Fourier space; in the small-mesh diffusive limit its generator converges to the classical Black-Scholes-Merton operator. We do not propose another parametric model. We propose a foundation for model construction that is observable, first-principles, and mathematically natural. Noncommutativity emerges from the observable shift algebra rather than being postulated. The jump-intensity ledger determines tail behavior and short-maturity smiles and implies testable links between extreme-event probabilities and implied-volatility wings. Future directions: (i) multi-asset systems on higher-dimensional lattices with vector shifts and block kernels; (ii) state- or flow-dependent kernels as "financial interactions" leading to nonlinear master equations while preserving linear risk-neutral pricing; (iii) empirical tests of the predicted scaling relations between jump intensities and market extremes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ouyang, Pratik Rath</p>
            <p>Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diyi Liu, Shuchen Zhu, Guang Hao Low, Lin Lin, Chao Yang</p>
            <p>Efficient block encoding of many-body Hamiltonians is a central requirement for quantum algorithms in scientific computing, particularly in the early fault-tolerant era. In this work, we introduce new explicit constructions for block encoding second-quantized Hamiltonians that substantially reduce Clifford+T gate complexity and ancilla overhead. By utilizing a data lookup strategy based on the SWAP architecture for the sparsity oracle $O_C$, and a direct sampling method for the amplitude oracle $O_A$ with SELECT-SWAP architecture, we achieve a T count that scales as $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{L})$ with respect to the number of interaction terms $L$ in general second-quantized Hamiltonians. We also achieve an improved constant factor in the Clifford gate count of our oracle. Furthermore, we design a block encoding that directly targets the $\eta$-particle subspace, thereby reducing the subnormalization factor from $\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$, and improving fault-tolerant efficiency when simulating systems with fixed particle numbers. Building on the block encoding framework developed for general many-body Hamiltonians, we extend our approach to electronic Hamiltonians whose coefficient tensors exhibit translation invariance or possess decaying structures. Our results provide a practical path toward early fault-tolerant quantum simulation of many-body systems, substantially lowering resource overheads compared to previous methods.</p>

            <p>This work investigates the performance of numerical optimization algorithms applied to the State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver for the H2 molecule under various quantum noise conditions. The goal is to assess the stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency of commonly used gradient-based, gradient-free, and global optimization strategies within the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum regime. We systematically compare six representative optimizers, BFGS, SLSQP, Nelder-Mead, Powell, COBYLA, and iSOMA,under ideal, stochastic, and decoherence noise models, including phase damping, depolarizing, and thermal relaxation channels. Each optimizer was tested over multiple noise intensities and measurement settings to characterize convergence behavior and sensitivity to noise-induced landscape distortions. The results show that BFGS consistently achieves the most accurate energies with minimal evaluations, maintaining robustness even under moderate decoherence. COBYLA performs well for low-cost approximations, while SLSQP exhibits instability in noisy regimes. Global approaches such as iSOMA show potential but are computationally expensive. These findings provide practical guidance for selecting suitable optimizers in variational quantum simulations, highlighting the importance of noise-aware optimization strategies for reliable and efficient quantum chemistry computations on current hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Heinzel, René Sondenheimer</p>
            <p>Gaussian states are an essential building block for various applications in quantum optics and quantum information science, yet the precise relation between their second- and third-order correlation functions remains not fully explored. We discuss connections between these correlation functions by constructing an explicit decomposition formula for arbitrary sixth-order moments of ladder operators for general Gaussian states and demonstrate how the derived relations enable state classification from correlation data alone. Whereas violating these relations certifies non-Gaussianity, satisfying them provides evidence for a Gaussian-state description and allows a direct distinction among non-displaced, non-squeezed, and displaced-squeezed sectors of the Gaussian state space. Further, we show that it is not possible to uniquely extract state parameters solely from correlation-function measurements without prior assumptions about the Gaussian state. Resolving this ambiguity requires additional loss-sensitive information, e.g., measuring the mean intensity or the vacuum overlap of each mode. In particular, we show under which circumstances these measurements can be used to reconstruct a generic Gaussian state.</p>

We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current.

            <p>The realization of strong nonlinear coupling between single photons has been a long-standing goal in quantum optics and quantum information science, promising wide impact applications, such as all-optical deterministic quantum logic and single-photon frequency conversion. Here, we report an experimental observation of the strong coupling between a single-photon and a two-photon Fock state in an ultrastrongly-coupled circuit-QED system. This strong nonlinear interaction is realized by introducing a detuned flux qubit working as an effective coupler between two modes of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The ultrastrong light--matter interaction breaks the excitation number conservation, and an external flux bias breaks the parity conservation. The combined effect of the two enables the strong one--two-photon coupling. Quantum Rabi-like avoided crossing is resolved when tuning the two-photon resonance frequency of the first mode across the single-photon resonance frequency of the second mode. Within this new photonic regime, we observe the thresholdless second harmonic generation for a mean photon number below one. Our results represent a key step towards a new regime of quantum nonlinear optics, where individual photons can deterministically and coherently interact with each other in the absence of any stimulating fields.</p>

            <p>A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigensolutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum are predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a {quantum-criticality-enhanced} effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.</p>

            <p>Non-Gaussian states of light are essential for numerous quantum information protocols; thus, certifying non-Gaussianity is crucial. Full quantum state tomography, commonly used for this purpose, is a complicated procedure and yields inconclusive results for strongly mixed states. Certifying non-Gaussianity through directly measurable parameters is a simpler alternative, typically achieved by measuring photon-number probabilities - either directly, using photon-number resolving detectors, or through Hanbury Brown--Twiss type measurements with single-photon detectors. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that optical parametric amplification combined with conventional intensity detectors can effectively replace this approach without the need for photon-number resolution. In our method, we measure the mean photon number and the second-order correlation function for the amplified state. Using it, we successfully certify the non-Gaussianity of a heralded quasi-single-photon state. Since optical parametric amplification is a broadband and multimode process, our method provides a foundation for developing high-dimensional quantum technologies utilizing broadband multimode non-Gaussian states.</p>

            <h2>Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhilong Liu, Wentao Liu, Xiaofang Liu, Jieci Wang</p>
            <p>Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>A Hardware-Efficient Mølmer-Sørensen Gate for Superconducting Quantum Computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. AbuGhanem</p>
            <p>The Mølmer-Sørensen gate, a cornerstone entangling operation in trapped-ion systems, represents a promising alternative to standard entangling gates in superconducting quantum architectures. However, its performance on superconducting hardware has remained unverified. In this work, we present a hardware-efficient implementation of the Mølmer-Sørensen gate and characterize its performance using quantum process tomography (QPT) on IBM Quantum's superconducting processors. Our implementation achieves a process fidelity of 92.47\% on the real quantum hardware, a performance competitive with the 93.02\% fidelity of the device's native controlled-NOT (CX) gate. Furthermore, for the $|00\rangle$ input state, the gate prepares the target Bell state with $94.2\%$ success probability, confirming its correct logical operation. These results demonstrate that non-native entangling gates can be optimized to perform on par with hardware-native operations. This work expands the effective gate set for algorithm design on fixed-architecture processors and provides a critical benchmark for cross-platform gate evaluation, underscoring the role of hardware-aware compilation in advancing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing.</p>

            <h2>Proposals for experimentally realizing (mostly) quantum-autonomous gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Antonio Marín Guzmán, Yu-Xin Wang, Tom Manovitz, Paul Erker, Norbert M. Linke, Simone Gasparinetti, Nicole Yunger Halpern</p>
            <p>Autonomous quantum machines (AQMs) execute tasks without requiring time-dependent external control. Motivations for AQMs include the restrictions imposed by classical control on quantum machines' coherence times and geometries. Most AQM work is theoretical and abstract; yet an experiment recently demonstrated AQMs' usefulness in qubit reset, crucial to quantum computing. To further reduce quantum computing's classical control, we propose realizations of (fully and partially) quantum-autonomous gates on three platforms: Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. First, we show that a Rydberg-blockade interaction or an ultrafast transition can quantum-autonomously effect entangling gates on Rydberg atoms. One can perform $Z$ or entangling gates on trapped ions mostly quantum-autonomously, by sculpting a linear Paul trap or leveraging a ring trap. Passive lasers control these gates, as well as the Rydberg-atom gates, quantum-autonomously. Finally, circuit quantum electrodynamics can enable quantum-autonomous $Z$ and $XY$ gates on superconducting qubits. The gates can serve as building blocks for (fully or partially) quantum-autonomous circuits, which may reduce classical-control burdens.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulation of chemistry via quantum fast multipole method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominic W. Berry, Kianna Wan, Andrew D. Baczewski, Elliot C. Eklund, Arkin Tikku, Ryan Babbush</p>
            <p>Here we describe an approach for simulating quantum chemistry on quantum computers with significantly lower asymptotic complexity than prior work. The approach uses a real-space first-quantised representation of the molecular Hamiltonian which we propagate using high-order product formulae. Essential for this low complexity is the use of a technique similar to the fast multipole method for computing the Coulomb operator with $\widetilde{\cal O}(\eta)$ complexity for a simulation with $\eta$ particles. We show how to modify this algorithm so that it can be implemented on a quantum computer. We ultimately demonstrate an approach with $t(\eta^{4/3}N^{1/3} + \eta^{1/3} N^{2/3} ) (\eta Nt/\epsilon)^{o(1)}$ gate complexity, where $N$ is the number of grid points, $\epsilon$ is target precision, and $t$ is the duration of time evolution. This is roughly a speedup by ${\cal O}(\eta)$ over most prior algorithms. We provide lower complexity than all prior work for $N<\eta^6$ (the regime of practical interest), with only first-quantised interaction-picture simulations providing better performance for $N>\eta^6$. As with the classical fast multipole method, large numbers $\eta\gtrsim 10^3$ would be needed to realise this advantage.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) represent one of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation. From a practical implementation perspective, non-Abelian theories present significantly tougher challenges than Abelian LGTs. However, it is unknown whether this is also reflected in increased values of quantum resources relating to the complexity of simulating quantum many-body models. Here, we compare three paradigmatic measures of quantum resources -- stabilizer Rényi entropy, generalized geometric measure of entanglement, and fermionic antiflatness -- for pure-gauge theories on a ladder with Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$ as well as non-Abelian $D_3$ and SU(2) gauge symmetries. We find that non-Abelian symmetries are not necessarily inherently harder to simulate than Abelian ones, but rather the required quantum resources depend nontrivially on the interplay between the group structure, superselection sector, and encoding of the gauge constraints. Our findings help indicate where quantum advantage could emerge in simulations of LGTs, both in NISQ and fault-tolerant eras.</p>

            <p>A simple way to calculate Rabi frequencies is outlined for interactions of atomic or nuclear multipole moments with laser fields that focuses on their relative geometry. The resulting expression takes the form of a dot product between the laser polarization and a vector spherical harmonic, thereby naturally connecting to the multipole's far-field spontaneous-emission pattern and providing a way to visualize the interaction. Since the vector spherical harmonics are not yet a standard tool in quantum science, their relevant properties are reviewed. This approach is illustrated in the calculation of a variety of beam effects, yielding both perturbative corrections and some nontrivial cases with non-vanishing coupling.</p>

            <p>Quantum state transfer is a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation, where fast and reliable communication between distant spins is essential. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum state transfer in linear spin chains tailored to superconducting flux qubits. Starting from a perfect state transfer scheme via a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous couplings, we adapt it for architectures implementing the transverse-field Ising model by encoding the information in domain walls. The resulting linear Ising chain makes quantum transport experiments accessible to many platforms for analog quantum simulation. We test the protocol for 1-, 2-, and 3- spin states, obtaining high transfer fidelities of up to 0.99 and study the accuracy dependence on the domain wall approximation. These results are the first step in paving the way for an experimental implementation of the protocol.</p>

            <h2>On Quantum Computation Using Bias-Preserving Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debadrito Roy, Aryaman Manish Kolhe, V. Lalitha, Navin Kashyap</p>
            <p>Certain types of quantum computing platforms, such as those realized using Rydberg atoms or Kerr-cat qubits, are natively more susceptible to Pauli-Z noise than Pauli-X noise, or vice versa. On such hardware, it is useful to ensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in the noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for biased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms. In this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj Quantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving gates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a linear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving gate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set {X,R_z(\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \theta is any irrational multiple of 2\pi. (3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any Z-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving gates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that Z-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Reconfigurable dissipative entanglement between many spin ensembles: from robust quantum sensing to many-body state engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anjun Chu, Mikhail Mamaev, Martin Koppenhöfer, Ming Yuan, Aashish A. Clerk</p>
            <p>An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.</p>

            <h2>Generating Entangled Steady States in Multistable Open Quantum Systems via Initial State Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Fallas Padilla, Raphael Kaubruegger, Adrianna Gillman, Stephen Becker, Ana Maria Rey</p>
            <p>Entanglement underpins the power of quantum technologies, yet it is fragile and typically destroyed by dissipation. Paradoxically, the same dissipation, when carefully engineered, can drive a system toward robust entangled steady states. However, this engineering task is nontrivial, as dissipative many-body systems are complex, particularly when they support multiple steady states. Here, we derive analytic expressions that predict how the steady state of a system evolving under a Lindblad equation depends on the initial state, without requiring integration of the dynamics. These results extend the frameworks developed in Refs. [Phys. Rev. A 89, 022118 (2014) and Phys. Rev. X 6, 041031 (2016)], showing that while the steady-state manifold is determined by the Liouvillian kernel, the weights within it depend on both the Liouvillian and the initial state. We identify a special class of Liouvillians for which the steady state depends only on the initial overlap with the kernel. Our framework provides analytical insight and a computationally efficient tool for predicting steady states in open quantum systems. As an application, we propose schemes to generate metrologically useful entangled steady states in spin ensembles via balanced collective decay.</p>

            <h2>Optimal lower bounds for quantum state tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thilo Scharnhorst, Jack Spilecki, John Wright</p>
            <p>We show that $n = \Omega(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary to learn a rank $r$ mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ up to error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance. This matches the upper bound of $n = O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ from prior work, and therefore settles the sample complexity of mixed state tomography. We prove this lower bound by studying a special case of full state tomography that we refer to as projector tomography, in which $\rho$ is promised to be of the form $\rho = P/r$, where $P \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is a rank $r$ projector. A key technical ingredient in our proof, which may be of independent interest, is a reduction which converts any algorithm for projector tomography which learns to error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance to an algorithm which learns to error $O(\varepsilon)$ in the more stringent Bures distance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bora Basyildiz, Zhexuan Gong, Sahel Ashhab</p>
            <p>The speed of elementary quantum gates sets a limit on the speed at which quantum circuits can be applied and, as a result, the size of the computations that can be performed on a quantum computer. This limitation stems from the fact that present-day quantum hardware systems have finite coherence times that limit the total computation time. The speeds of qubit gates in various hardware settings have been well studied over the past few decades. The recent interest in multi-level quantum systems naturally creates a need for similar investigations of the speeds of multi-level or qudit gates. In this work, we perform an empirical study of the speed limit for the three-level or qutrit CZ gate. Our analysis focuses on a theoretical model for capacitively coupled superconducting transmons but can be extended to other systems. We generate CZ gate protocols using optimal control theory techniques and observe when the fidelity crosses certain thresholds. In addition to the empirical approach, we derive an analytical speed limit for the qutrit CZ gate using traditional quantum speed limit techniques. We compare the speed limits derived using these two different approaches and discuss the gap that remains between them. We also compare the time needed to implement the qutrit CZ gate with its qubit counterpart.</p>

            <p>We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and quantum simulations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Tanner Color Codes on Qubits with Transversal Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle Gulshen, Tali Kaufman</p>
            <p>This work focuses on growing our understanding of how high dimensional expanders (HDX) can be utilized to construct highly performant quantum codes. While asymptotically good qLDPC codes have been constructed on 2D HDX built from products of graphs, these constructions have a number of limitations, like lack of structure useful for fault-tolerant logic. We develop a framework for transversal logical gates that can naturally utilize symmetric non-product simplicial HDX, and we demonstrate a particular code in this framework that offers various advantages over prior constructions. Specifically, we study the generalization of color codes to \emph{Tanner color codes}, which encompass color, pin, and rainbow codes, and should enable constructions with better parameters. We prove an `unfolding' theorem that characterizes the logical operators of the Tanner color code in terms of logical operators from several colored copies of the companion sheaf code. We leverage this understanding of the logical operators to identify a local condition that ensures such a code on a $D$-dimensional complex has a strictly-transversal $\frac{2 \pi}{2^D}$-phase gate on a single block, $\frac{2 \pi}{2^\ell}$-phase gates on subsets of a single block for $\ell<D$, and $C^{D-1}Z$ across $D$ blocks that preserve the code space. We explicitly instantiate our paradigm in every dimension with codes on highly-symmetric expanding coset complexes. These are the first qubit codes explicitly defined on expanding (non-product) simplicial complexes. We investigate in detail the self-dual 2D family, which has large rate $\geq \frac{7}{64}$ and transversal $CZ$, $S$, and $H$ gates, among many other fault-tolerant (generalizations of) fold-transversal gates arising from the symmetry of the complex. We conjecture that it has constant relative distance. We conclude by describing a Floquet variant of this code with check weight 4.</p>

            <p>Quantum blockchains provide inherent resilience against quantum adversaries and represent a promising alternative to classical blockchain systems in the quantum era. However, existing quantum blockchain architectures largely depend on entanglement to maintain inter-block connections, facing challenges in stability, consensus efficiency, and system verification. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel quantum blockchain framework based on quantum walks, which reduces reliance on entanglement while improving stability and connection efficiency. We further propose a quantum consensus mechanism based on a weighted quantum voting protocol, which enables a fairer voting process while reflecting the weights of different nodes. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct circuit simulations to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of both the quantum walk-based block construction and the quantum voting consensus mechanism. Compared with existing entanglement-dependent approaches, our framework achieves stronger stability and enables simpler verification of block integrity, making it a practical candidate for quantum-era blockchain applications.</p>

            <p>The gravitational fields of astrophysical bodies bend the light around them, creating multiple paths along which light from a distant source can arrive at Earth. Measuring the difference in photon arrival time along these different paths provides a means of determining the mass of the lensing system, which is otherwise difficult to constrain. This is particularly challenging in the case of microlensing, where the images produced by lensing cannot be individually resolved; existing proposals for detecting time delays in microlensed systems are significantly constrained due to the need for large photon flux and the loss of signal coherence when the angular diameter of the light source becomes too large. In this work, we propose a novel approach to measuring astrophysical time delays. Our method uses exponentially fewer photons than previous schemes, enabling observations that would otherwise be impossible. Our approach, which combines a quantum-inspired algorithm and quantum information processing technologies, saturates a provable lower bound on the number of photons required to find the time delay. Our scheme has multiple applications: we explore its use both in calibrating optical interferometric telescopes and in making direct mass measurements of ongoing microlensing events. To demonstrate the latter, we present a fiducial example of microlensed stellar flares sources in the Galactic Bulge. Though the number of photons produced by such events is small, we show that our photon-efficient scheme opens the possibility of directly measuring microlensing time delays using existing and near-future ground-based telescopes.</p>

            <p>We introduce Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI), a quantum algorithm that utilizes coherent Bell measurements and the symplectic representation of the Pauli group to reduce Gibbs sampling and Hamiltonian optimization to classical decoding. For a signed Pauli Hamiltonian $H$ and any degree-$\ell$ polynomial ${P}$, HDQI prepares a purification of the density matrix $\rho_{P}(H) \propto {P}^2(H)$ by solving a combination of two tasks: decoding $\ell$ errors on a classical code defined by $H$, and preparing a pilot state that encodes the anti-commutation structure of $H$. Choosing $P(x)$ to approximate $\exp(-\beta x/2)$ yields Gibbs states at inverse temperature $\beta$; other choices prepare approximate ground states, microcanonical ensembles, and other spectral filters. For local Hamiltonians, the corresponding decoding problem is that of LDPC codes. Preparing the pilot state is always efficient for commuting Hamiltonians, but highly non-trivial for non-commuting Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, we prove that this state admits an efficient matrix product state representation for Hamiltonians whose anti-commutation graph decomposes into connected components of logarithmic size. We show that HDQI efficiently prepares Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures for a class of physically motivated commuting Hamiltonians -- including the toric code and Haah's cubic code -- but we also develop a matching efficient classical algorithm for this task. For a non-commuting semiclassical spin glass and commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians with quantum defects, HDQI prepares Gibbs states up to a constant inverse-temperature threshold using polynomial quantum resources and quasi-polynomial classical pre-processing. These results position HDQI as a versatile algorithmic primitive and the first extension of Regev's reduction to non-abelian groups.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing holds significant promise for scientific computing due to its potential for polynomial to even exponential speedups over classical methods, which are often hindered by the curse of dimensionality. While neural networks present a mesh-free alternative to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), their accuracy is difficult to achieve since one needs to solve a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using the stochastic gradient descent method and its variants, the convergence of which is difficult to prove and cannot be guaranteed. The classical random feature method (RFM) effectively merges advantages from both classical numerical analysis and neural network based techniques, achieving spectral accuracy and a natural adaptability to complex geometries. In this work, we introduce a quantum random feature method (QRFM) that leverages quantum computing to accelerate the classical RFM framework. Our method constructs PDE solutions using quantum-generated random features and enforces the governing equations via a collocation approach. A complexity analysis demonstrates that this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup over the classical RFM.</p>

Then we prove an approximation preserving reduction from MAX-CUT to PRODUCT-QMC the product state version of QUANTUM MAX-CUT. More precisely, in the second part, we construct a PTAS reduction from MAX-CUT$_k$ (the rank-k constrained version of MAX-CUT) to MAX-CUT$_{k+1}$, where MAX-CUT and PRODUCT-QMC coincide with MAX-CUT$_1$ and MAX-CUT$_3$ respectively.

We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <p>A recent paper by Jordan et al. introduced Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), a novel quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce linear optimization problems -- max-XORSAT and max-LINSAT -- to decoding problems. In this paper, we extend DQI to optimization problems involving quadratic constraints, which we call max-QUADSAT. Leveraging a connection to quadratic Gauss sums, we give an efficient algorithm to prepare the DQI state for max-QUADSAT. To demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a quantum advantage, we introduce the Quadratic Optimal Polynomial Intersection (quadratic-OPI) problem, a restricted variant of OPI for which, to our knowledge, the standard DQI framework offers no algorithmic speedup. We show that quadratic-OPI is an instance of max-QUADSAT and use our algorithm to optimize it. Lastly, we present a new generalized proof of the "semicircle law" for the fraction of satisfied constraints, generalizing it to any DQI state of problems where the distribution of the number of satisfied constraints for a random assignment is sufficiently close to a binomial distribution. This condition holds exactly for the DQI state of max-LINSAT, and approximately holds in the max-QUADSAT case, with the approximation becoming exponentially better as the problem size increases. This establishes performance guarantees for our algorithm.</p>

            <h2>An infinite hierarchy of multi-copy quantum learning tasks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Nöller, Viet T. Tran, Mariami Gachechiladze, Richard Kueng</p>
            <p>Learning properties of quantum states from measurement data is a fundamental challenge in quantum information. The sample complexity of such tasks depends crucially on the measurement primitive. While shadow tomography achieves sample-efficient learning by allowing entangling measurements across many copies, it requires prohibitively deep circuits. At the other extreme, two-copy measurements already yield exponential advantages over single-copy strategies in tasks such as Pauli tomography. In this work we show that such sharp separations extend far beyond the two-copy regime: for every prime c we construct explicit learning tasks of degree c, which are exponentially hard with (c - 1)-copy measurements but efficiently solvable with c-copy measurements. Our protocols are not only sample-efficient but also realizable with shallow circuits. Extending further, we show that such finite-degree tasks exist for all square-free integers c, pointing toward a general principle underlying their existence. Together, our results reveal an infinite hierarchy of multi-copy learning problems, uncovering new phase transitions in sample complexity and underscoring the role of reliable quantum memory as a key resource for exponential quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Approach to Quantum Key Leasing with a Classical Lessor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuyuki Kitagawa, Jiahui Liu, Shota Yamada, Takashi Yamakawa</p>
            <p>Secure key leasing allows a cryptographic key to be leased as a quantum state in such a way that the key can later be revoked in a verifiable manner. In this work, we propose a modular framework for constructing secure key leasing with a classical-lessor, where the lessor is entirely classical and, in particular, the quantum secret key can be both leased and revoked using only classical communication. Based on this framework, we obtain classical-lessor secure key leasing schemes for public-key encryption (PKE), pseudorandom function (PRF), and digital signature. We adopt the strong security notion known as security against verification key revealing attacks (VRA security) proposed by Kitagawa et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) into the classical-lessor setting, and we prove that all three of our schemes satisfy this notion under the learning with errors assumption. Our PKE scheme improves upon the previous construction by Goyal et al. (Eurocrypt 2025), and our PRF and digital signature schemes are respectively the first PRF and digital signature with classical-lessor secure key leasing property.</p>

            <h2>On the modeling of irreversibility by relaxator Liouville dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janos Hajdu, Martin Janßen</p>
            <p>A general approach to modeling irreversibility starting from microscopic reversibility is presented. The time $t_s$ up to which relevant degrees of freedom of a system are tracked is extremely much shorter than the spectral resolution time $t_e$ that would be necessary to resolve the spectrum of all degrees of freedom involved. A relaxator that breaks reversibility condenses in the Liouville operator of the relevant degrees of freedom. The irrelevant degrees of freedom act as an environment to the system. The irreversible relaxator Liouville equation contains memory effects and initial correlations of all degrees of freedom. Stationary states turn out to be generically unique and independent of the initial conditions and exceptions are due to degeneracies. Equilibrium states lie in the relaxator's kernel yielding a stationary Pauli master equation. Kinetic equations for oneparticle densities are constructed as special cases of relaxator Liouville dynamics. Kubo's linear response theory is generalized to relaxator Liouville dynamics and related to irreversibility within the system. In a weak coupling approximation between system and environment the relaxator can be reduced to environmental correlations and bilinear system operators. Markov approximation turns the relaxator Liouville dynamics into a semi-group dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Algorithm for Low Energy Effective Hamiltonian and Quasi-Degenerate Eigenvalue Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Tse Li, Tzen Ong, Chih-Yun Lin, Yu-Cheng Chen, Hsin Lin, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>Quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems are central to quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics, where low-energy spectra often form manifolds of nearly degenerate states that determine physical properties. Standard quantum algorithms, such as phase estimation and QSVT-based eigenvalue filtering, work well when a unique ground state is separated by a moderate spectral gap, but in the quasi-degenerate regime they require resolution finer than the intra-manifold splitting; otherwise, they return an uncontrolled superposition within the low-energy span and fail to detect or resolve degeneracies. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm that directly diagonalizes such quasi-degenerate manifolds by solving an effective-Hamiltonian eigenproblem in a low-dimensional reference subspace. This reduced problem is exactly equivalent to the full eigenproblem, and its solutions are lifted to the full Hilbert space via a block-encoded wave operator. Our analysis provides provable bounds on eigenvalue accuracy and subspace fidelity, together with total query complexity, demonstrating that quasi-degenerate eigenvalue problems can be solved efficiently without assuming any intra-manifold splitting. We benchmark the algorithm on several systems (the Fermi-Hubbard model, LiH, and the transition-metal complex [Ru(bpy)$_3$]$^{2+}$), demonstrating robust performance and reliable resolution of (quasi-)degeneracies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaomin Liu, Jing Zhang, Jie Li, Rongguo Yang, Jiangrui Gao, Tiancai Zhang</p>
            <p>Magnomechanical systems with YIG spheres have been proven to be an ideal system for studying magnomechanically induced transparency, dynamical backaction, and rich nonlinear effects, such as the magnon-phonon cross-Kerr effect. Accurate characterization of the magnetostriction induced deformation displacement is important as it can be used for, e.g., estimating the magnon excitation number and the strength of the dynamical backaction. Here we propose an optical approach for detecting the magnetostrictive deformation of a YIG sphere in three dimensions (3Ds) with high precision. It is based on the deformation induced spatial high-order modes of the scattered field, postselection, and balanced homodyne detection. With feasible parameters, we show that the measurement precision of the deformation in $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions can reach the picometer level. We further reveal the advantages of our scheme using a higher-order probe beam and balanced homodyne detection by means of quantum and classical Fisher information. The real-time and high-precision measurement of the YIG sphere's deformation in 3Ds can be used to determinate specific mechanical modes, characterize the magnomechanical dynamical backaction and the 3D cooling of the mechanical vibration, and thus finds a wide range of applications in magnomechanics.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Quantum Homeopathy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Bittel, Lorenzo Leone</p>
            <p>Randomness is a fundamental resource in quantum information, with crucial applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. A central challenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate Haar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford operations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able to generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial quantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford gates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design only to a subsystem of size $\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This "seed" design is then "diluted" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between two random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this construction achieves full quantum security against adaptive adversaries using only $\tilde{O}(k^2 \log\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requires security only against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford cost decreases to $\tilde{O}(k + \log^{1+c} \varepsilon^{-1})$. This is optimal, since we show that at least $\Omega(k)$ non-Clifford gates are required in this setting. Compared to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces non-Clifford overhead while strengthening security guarantees to adaptive security as well as removing artificial assumptions between $n$ and $k$. These results make high-order unitary designs practically attainable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</p>

            <h2>Pattern or Not? QAOA Parameter Heuristics and Potentials of Parsimony</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Eichenseher, Maja Franz, Christian Wolff, Wolfgang Mauerer</p>
            <p>Structured variational quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) have emerged as leading candidates for exploiting advantages of near-term quantum hardware. They interlace classical computation, in particular optimisation of variational parameters, with quantum-specific routines, and combine problem-specific advantages -- sometimes even provable -- with adaptability to the constraints of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While circuit depth can be parametrically increased and is known to improve performance in an ideal (noiseless) setting, on realistic hardware greater depth exacerbates noise: The overall quality of results depends critically on both, variational parameters and circuit depth. Although identifying optimal parameters is NP-hard, prior work has suggested that they may exhibit regular, predictable patterns for increasingly deep circuits and depending on the studied class of problems. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of classical parameters in QAOA performance through extensive numerical simulations and suggest a simple, yet effective heuristic scheme to find good parameters for low-depth circuits. Our results demonstrate that: (i) optimal parameters often deviate substantially from expected patterns; (ii) QAOA performance becomes progressively less sensitive to specific parameter choices as depth increases; and (iii) iterative component-wise fixing performs on par with, and at shallow depth may even outperform, several established parameter-selection strategies. We identify conditions under which structured parameter patterns emerge, and when deviations from the patterns warrant further consideration. These insights for low-depth circuits may inform more robust pathways to harnessing QAOA in realistic quantum compute scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Classification and implementation of unitary-equivariant and permutation-invariant quantum channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Mančinska, Elias Theil</p>
            <p>Many quantum information tasks use inputs of the form $\rho^{\otimes m}$, which naturally induce permutation and unitary symmetries. We classify all quantum channels that respect both symmetries - i.e. unitary-equivariant and permutation-invariant quantum channels from $(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes m}$ to $(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes n}$ - via their extremal points. Operationally, each extremal quantum channel factors as unitary Schur sampling $\rightarrow$ an irrep-level unitary-equivariant quantum channel $\rightarrow$ the adjoint unitary Schur sampling. We give a streaming implementation ansatz that uses an efficient streaming implementation of unitary Schur sampling together with a resource-state primitive, and we apply it to state symmetrization, symmetric cloning, and purity amplification. In these applications we obtain polynomial-time algorithms with exponential memory improvements in $m,n$. Further, for symmetric cloning we present, to our knowledge, the first efficient (polynomial-time) algorithm with explicit memory and gate bounds.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Fidelity Estimation with Few Local Pauli Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyu Sun, Gabriel Waite, Michael Bremner, Christopher Ferrie</p>
            <p>As quantum devices scale, quantifying how close an experimental state aligns with a target becomes both vital and challenging. Fidelity is the standard metric, but existing estimators either require full tomography or apply only to restricted state/measurement families. Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2025) introduced an efficient certification protocol for Haar-random states using only a polynomial number of non-adaptive, single-copy, local Pauli measurements. Here, we adopt the same data collection routine but recast it as a fidelity estimation protocol with rigorous performance guarantees and broaden its applicability. We analyze the bias in this estimator, linking its performance to the mixing time $\tau$ of a Markov chain induced by the target state, and resolve the three open questions posed by Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (Nature Physics, 2025). Our analysis extends beyond Haar-random states to state $t$-designs, states prepared by low-depth random circuits, physically relevant states and families of mixed states. We introduce a $k$-generalized local escape property that identifies when the fidelity estimation protocol is both efficient and accurate, and design a practical empirical test to verify its applicability for arbitrary states. This work enables scalable benchmarking, error characterization, and tomography assistance, supports adaptive quantum algorithms in high dimensions, and clarifies fundamental limits of learning from local measurements.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation follows according to non-Hermitian operators. As a result, such systems can host non-Hermitian degeneracies called Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs). In this work, we show that Newton polygons and tropical geometric approach allow identification and characterization of Liouvillian EPs. We use two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</p>

            <p>Calculating the quantum weight enumerator polynomial (WEP) is a valuable tool for characterizing quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes, but it is computationally hard for large or complex codes. The Quantum LEGO (QL) framework provides a tensor network approach for WEP calculation, in some cases offering superpolynomial speedups over brute-force methods, provided the code exhibits area law entanglement, that a good QL layout is used, and an efficient tensor network contraction schedule is found. We analyze the performance of a hyper-optimized contraction schedule framework across QL layouts for diverse stabilizer code families. We find that the intermediate tensors in the QL networks for stabilizer WEPs are often highly sparse, invalidating the dense-tensor assumption of standard cost functions. To address this, we introduce an exact, polynomial-time Sparse Stabilizer Tensor (SST) cost function based on the rank of the parity check matrices for intermediate tensors. The SST cost function correlates perfectly with the true contraction cost, providing a significant advantage over the default cost function, which exhibits large uncertainty. Optimizing contraction schedules using the SST cost function yields substantial performance gains, achieving up to orders of magnitude improvement in actual contraction cost compared to using the dense tensor cost function. Furthermore, the precise cost estimation from the SST function offers an efficient metric to decide whether the QL-based WEP calculation is computationally superior to brute force for a given QL layout. These results, enabled by PlanqTN, a new open-source QL implementation, validate hyper-optimized contraction as a crucial technique for leveraging the QL framework to explore the QEC code design space.</p>

            <p>In precision force sensing of multi-mechanical mode optomechanical systems, coherent interference can decouple certain degenerate vibrational modes from the cavity field, leading to incomplete information regarding the measured signal. In this paper, we propose a scheme to enhance and control the detection bandwidth in optomechanical force sensing by exploiting synthetic magnetism achieved through tuning phonon hopping interactions. By toggling between broken and unbroken dark mode, this approach effectively manages the response bandwidth and exhibits intriguing additional noise characteristics. Specifically, when the dark mode remains unbroken, the thermal noise is robust and reduced to half of that of a standard device. In contrast, when the dark mode is broken, thermal noise increases substantially at mechanical resonance but remains the same as when the dark mode is unbroken at effective detection frequencies. Moreover, our scheme offers the dual benefit of amplifying the mechanical response while suppressing additional noise, with the potential to surpass the standard quantum limit.</p>

We derive a non-perturbative expression for the characteristic function of the quantum field and apply it to thermal Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states, showing that the resulting work distributions satisfy both the Crooks fluctuation theorem and the Jarzynski equality. Furthermore, we analyse the case of a pointlike detector, obtaining compact expressions for the first two moments of the work distribution, allowing us to recover the standard fluctuation-dissipation relation in the high-temperature limit.

This variational algorithm uses samples from a quantum optical circuit, which are post-processed using trainable classical bit-flip probabilities, to propose candidate solutions. A gradient-based training loop finds progressively better solutions until convergence. We perform ablation tests that validate the structure of the algorithm. We then evaluate its performance on an illustrative range of binary optimisation problems, using both simulators and real hardware, and perform comparisons to classical algorithms. We find that this algorithm produces high-quality solutions to these problems. As such, this algorithm is a promising method for leveraging the scalable nature of photonic quantum processors to solve large-scale real-world optimisation problems.</p>

First, we prove the existence of weak transversal gates on the class of Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes, covering high-rate qLDPC and topological codes such as surface code or color codes, and present an efficient algorithm to determine the physical multi-qubit Pauli rotations required for the desired logical rotation. Second, we propose a partially fault-tolerant Clifford+$\phi$ architecture that performs in-place Pauli rotations via a repeat-until-success strategy; phenomenological simulations indicate that a rotation of 0.003 attains logical error of $9.5\times10^{-5}$ on a surface code with $d=7$ at physical error rate of $10^{-4}$, while avoiding the spacetime overheads of magic state factories, small angle synthesis, and routing. Finally, we perform resource estimation on surface and gross codes for a Trotter-like circuit with $N=108$ logical qubits to show that the Clifford+$\phi$ architecture outperforms the conventional Clifford+T approach by a factor of tens to a hundred in runtime due to natural rotation-gate parallelism.

            <p>Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in various applications and are known to be NP-hard. The seminal work of Goemans and Williamson introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for such problems, solvable in polynomial time that upper bounds the optimal value. Their approach also enables randomized rounding techniques to obtain feasible solutions with provable performance guarantees. In this work, we identify instances of QUBO problems where matrix multiplicative weight methods lead to quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms that approximate the Goemans-Williamson SDP exponentially faster than existing methods, achieving polylogarithmic time complexity relative to the problem dimension. This speedup is attainable under the assumption that the QUBO cost matrix is sparse when expressed as a linear combination of Pauli strings satisfying certain algebraic constraints, and leverages efficient quantum and classical simulation results for quantum Gibbs states. We demonstrate how to verify these conditions efficiently given the decomposition. Additionally, we explore heuristic methods for randomized rounding procedures and extract the energy of a feasible point of the QUBO in polylogarithmic time. While the practical relevance of instances where our methods excel remains to be fully established, we propose heuristic algorithms with broader applicability and identify Kronecker graphs as a promising class for applying our techniques. We conduct numerical experiments to benchmark our methods. Notably, by utilizing tensor network methods, we solve an SDP with $D = 2^{50}$ variables and extract a feasible point which is certifiably within $0.15\%$ of the optimum of the QUBO through our approach on a desktop, reaching dimensions millions of times larger than those handled by existing SDP or QUBO solvers, whether heuristic or rigorous.</p>

            <p>In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty -- particularly an agent's tolerance for risk -- determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a Rényi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</p>

            <h2>Quantum memory optimisation using finite-horizon, decoherence time and discounted mean-square performance criteria</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor G. Vladimirov, Ian R. Petersen, Guodong Shi</p>
            <p>This paper is concerned with open quantum memory systems for approximately retaining quantum information, such as initial dynamic variables or quantum states to be stored over a bounded time interval. In the Heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics, the deviation of the system variables from their initial values lends itself to closed-form computation in terms of tractable moment dynamics for open quantum harmonic oscillators and finite-level quantum systems governed by linear or quasi-linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations, respectively. This tractability is used in a recently proposed optimality criterion for varying the system parameters so as to maximise the memory decoherence time when the mean-square deviation achieves a given critical threshold. The memory decoherence time maximisation approach is extended beyond the previously considered low-threshold asymptotic approximation and to Schrödinger type mean-square deviation functionals for the reduced system state governed by the Lindblad master equation. We link this approach with the minimisation of the mean-square deviation functionals at a finite time horizon and with their discounted version which quantifies the averaged performance of the quantum system as a temporary memory under a Poisson flow of storage requests.</p>

            <h2>Clifford+V synthesis for multi-qubit unitary gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soichiro Yamazaki, Seiseki Akibue</p>
            <p>We developed a general framework for synthesizing target gates by using a finite set of basic gates, which is a crucial step in quantum compilation. When approximating a gate in SU($n$), a naive brute-force search requires a computational complexity of $O(1/\varepsilon^{(n^2 - 1)})$ to achieve an approximation with error $\varepsilon$. In contrast, by using our method, the complexity can be reduced to $O(-n^2 \log\varepsilon/\varepsilon^{((n^2 - 1)/2)})$. This method requires almost no assumptions and can be applied to a variety of gate sets, including Clifford+$T$ and Clifford+$V$. Further, we introduce a suboptimal but short run-time algorithm for synthesizing multi-qubit controlled gates. This approach highlights the role of subgroup structures in reducing synthesis complexity and opens a new direction of study on the compilation of multi-qubit gates. The framework is broadly applicable to different universal gate sets, and our analysis suggests that it can serve as a foundation for resource-efficient quantum compilation in near-term architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kosuke Matsui, Jun-Yi Wu, Hayata Yamasaki, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Mio Murao</p>
            <p>Scaling up the number of qubits available on quantum processors remains technically demanding even in the long term; it is therefore crucial to clarify the number of qubits required to implement a given quantum operation. For the most general class of quantum operations, known as quantum instruments, the qubit requirements are not well understood, especially when mid-circuit measurements and delayed input preparation are permitted. In this work, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the number of qubits required to implement a given quantum instrument in terms of the causal structure of the instrument. We further apply our results to entanglement distillation protocols based on stabilizer codes and show that, in these cases, the lower and upper bounds coincide, so the optimal qubit requirement is determined. In particular, we compute that the optimal number of qubits is 3 for the $[[9,1,3]]$-code-based protocol and 4 for the $[[5,1,3]]$-code-based protocol.</p>

However, it remains unclear what is the interplay between classical communication and quantum catalysis.

To do so, we explore a class of state transformations termed catalytic local operations (CLO) and compare it to LOCC and to stochastic LOCC augmented by bounded quantum communication. We show that these classes are incomparable and capture different facets of quantum state transformations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Yue Zhang, Zi-Xiang Li, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits. Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move'' dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are ``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Sparsification for Linear Programming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Étienne Objois, Adrian Vladu</p>
            <p>We introduce a generic framework for solving linear programs (LPs) with many constraints $(n \gg d)$ via adaptive sparsification. Our approach provides a principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method. Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution to an LP using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix. This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP solvers.</p>

            <p>Atomic metasurfaces (AMs) provide a powerful nanophotonic platform for integrating topological effects into quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate the quantum optical and topological properties of a two-dimensional Kagome AM, going beyond the tight-binding approximation and incorporating all-to-all interactions. We reveal selective higher-order topological states with a unique dynamical ``chasing" behavior, protected by a generalized chiral symmetry and enabling efficient topological directional transfer. By introducing an impurity atom -- a giant atom -- coupled to all array atoms, we observe chiral emission patterns strongly dependent on the atomic polarization. This nonlocal coupling structure allows exploration of self-interference effects at subwavelength scales. Our findings establish AMs as a versatile platform for engineering tunable topological states and chiral quantum optical phenomena, with potential applications in customized light sources and photonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Yu, Myung-Joong Hwang</p>
            <p>The spontaneous breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry typically gives rise to emergent excitations possessing the same symmetry with a renormalized mass. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we present a theory in which the low-lying excitation in the broken-symmetry phase acquires a continuous symmetry, even when the underlying symmetry of the system is discrete. In the presence of anisotropic long-range interactions, the order parameter renormalizes the relative strength of the particle-conserving and particle-nonconserving interactions. When one of the two renormalized interactions vanishes, a conservation law absent in the original Hamiltonian emerges, giving rise to a continuous symmetry. A striking consequence of the emergent continuous symmetry and conservation law is that it constrains quantum correlations in the ground-state to be zero, leading to the ground-state factorization in the presence of strong interactions. Our finding is a universal feature of quantum phase transitions in fully-connected systems and in their lattice generalizations; therefore, it can be observed in a wide range of physical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Bartusek, Aparna Gupte, Saachi Mutreja, Omri Shmueli</p>
            <p>A classical obfuscator for quantum circuits is a classical program that, given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, outputs the classical description of a functionally equivalent quantum circuit $\hat{Q}$ that hides as much as possible about $Q$. Previously, the only known feasibility result for classical obfuscation of quantum circuits (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) was limited to circuits that always reject. On the other hand, if the obfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit $Q$ into a quantum state $|\hat{Q}\rangle$, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and all unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025). We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical obfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. We do this by giving the first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum evaluation, relative to a classical oracle. To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on the approach of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which required ciphertexts that are both quantum and non-compact due to the use of quantum coset states and their publicly-verifiable properties. We introduce new techniques for analyzing coset states that can be generated ''on the fly'', by proving new cryptographic properties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025). Our techniques allow us to produce QFHE ciphertexts that are purely classical, compact, and publicly-verifiable. This also yields the first classical verification of quantum computation protocol for BQP that simultaneously satisfies blindness and public-verifiability.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme for the fault-tolerant implementation of arbitrary Clifford circuits. To achieve this, we extend previous work on flag gadgets for syndrome extraction to a general framework that flags any Clifford circuit. This framework opens new pathways toward universal fault tolerance by allowing transversal implementation of $T$ gates alongside fault-tolerant realization of selected non-transversal Clifford gates using flags. The construction we present allows a Clifford circuit consisting of $n$ two-qubit gates and $O(n)$ single-qubit gates acting upon physical qubits in a code of distance $d$ to be made fault tolerant to distance $d$ using $O(d^2 \log(nd^2\log n))$ ancilla qubits and $O(nd^2 \log(nd^2 \log n))$ extra CNOTs. Beyond asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate our construction by implementing the non-transversal logical Hadamard gate for the [[15,1,3]] code, which has transversal T, and compare to alternative approaches for universality using this code. We also apply our construction to magic-state preparation, general state preparation using Clifford circuits, and data-syndrome codes.</p>

            <p>Directed $st$-connectivity (DSTCON) is the problem of deciding if there exists a directed path between a pair of distinguished vertices $s$ and $t$ in an input directed graph. This problem appears in many algorithmic applications, and is also a fundamental problem in complexity theory, due to its ${\sf NL}$-completeness. We show that for any $S\geq \log^2(n)$, there is a quantum algorithm for DSTCON using space $S$ and time $T\leq 2^{\frac{1}{2}\log(n)\log(n/S)+o(\log^2(n))}$, which is an (up to quadratic) improvement over the best classical algorithm for any $S=o(\sqrt{n})$. Of the $S$ total space used by our algorithm, only $O(\log^2(n))$ is quantum space - the rest is classical. This effectively means that we can trade off classical space for quantum time.</p>

            <p>Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) promises cryptographic security based solely on observed quantum correlations, yet its implementation over long distances remains limited by the detection-efficiency loophole. Routed Bell tests have recently re-emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate this limitation by enabling local self-testing of one party's device. However, extending this idea to self-testing both communicating parties has remained unclear. Here, we introduce a modified setup that enables local self-tests for both Alice and Bob and analyze its security against potential attacks. Employing modern tools from robust self-testing, we show that in a BB84-type protocol between the self-tested devices, the achievable key rate varies continuously with the winning probability of the local tests. In particular, we find that perfect local Bell tests can, in principle, overcome the detection-efficiency barrier, rendering the asymptotic key rate limited only by standard bit-flip errors, as in the device-dependent case.</p>

            <p>Erasure qubits -- qubits designed to have an error profile that is dominated by detectable leakage errors -- are a promising way to cut down the resources needed for quantum error correction. There have been several recent experiments demonstrating erasure qubits in superconducting quantum processors, most notably the dual-rail qubit defined by the one-photon subspace of two coupled cavities. An outstanding challenge is that the ancillary transmons needed to facilitate erasure checks and two-qubit gates introduce a substantial amount of noise, limiting the benefits of working with erasure-biased qubits. Here, we show how to suppress the adverse effects of transmon-induced noise while performing erasure checks or two-qubit gates. We present control schemes for these operations that suppress erasure check errors by two orders of magnitude and reduce the logical two-qubit gate infidelities by up to three orders of magnitude.</p>

            <p>Betting games provide a natural setting to capture how information yields strategic advantage. The Kelly criterion for betting, long a cornerstone of portfolio theory and information theory, admits an interpretation in the limit of infinitely many repeated bets. We extend Kelly's seminal result into the single-shot and finite-betting regimes, recasting it as a resource theory of adversarial information. This allows one to quantify what it means for the gambler to have more information than the odds-maker. Given a target rate of return, after a finite number of bets, we compute the optimal strategy which maximises the probability of successfully reaching the target, revealing a risk-reward trade-off characterised by a hierarchy of Rényi divergences between the true distribution and the odds. The optimal strategies in the one-shot regime coincide with strategies maximizing expected utility, and minimising hypothesis testing errors, thereby bridging economic and information-theoretic viewpoints. We then generalize this framework to a distributed side-information game, in which multiple players observe correlated signals about an unknown state. Recasting gambling as an adversarial resource theory provides a unifying lens that connects economic and information-theoretic perspectives, and allows for generalisation to the quantum domain, where quantum side-information and entanglement play analogous roles.</p>

Existing protocols for achieving the Heisenberg limit precision are often restricted to specific Hamiltonian structures or demand experimentally challenging resources.

For multi-mode systems, we develop a hierarchical coefficients recovering strategy with superior statistical efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our protocol to first quantization, enabling the learning of fundamental physical parameters from Hamiltonians expressed in position and momentum operators at the Heisenberg limit.</p>

This is done by establishing an explicit correspondence with Bell inequalities and nonlocal games and constructing a computational space of this http URL show how computational assumptions are converted to computational Bell inequalities, in their rigorous mathematical sense, a hyperplane that separates the sets of classical and quantum verifier-prover interactions. We reveal precisely how the nonsignaling assumption in standard device-independent setups interchanges with the computational challenge of learning a hidden input (that we define). We further utilize our fundamental results to study explicit protocols using the new perspective. We take advantage of modular tools for studying nonlocality, deriving tighter Tsirelson bounds for single-prover protocols and bounding the entropy generated in the interaction, improving on previous results. Our work thus establishes a modular approach to analyzing single-prover quantum certification protocols based on computational assumptions through the fundamental lens of Bell inequalities, removing many layers of technical overhead. The link that we draw between single-prover protocols and Bell inequalities goes far beyond the spread intuitive understanding or known results about "compiled nonlocal games"; Notably, it captures the exact way in which the correspondence between computational assumptions and locality should be understood also in protocols based on, e.g., trapdoor claw-free functions (in which there is no clear underlying nonlocal game).</p>

            <p>We give a convergent hierarchy of SDP certificates for bounding the spectral gap of local qubit Hamiltonians from below. Our approach is based on the NPA hierarchy applied to a polynomially-sized system of constraints defining the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2^{n})$, as well as additional constraints which put restrictions on the corresponding representations of the algebra. We also use as input an upper bound on the ground state energy, either using a hierarchy introduced by Fawzi, Fawzi, and Scalet, or an analog for qubit Hamiltonians of the Lasserre hierarchy of upper bounds introduced by Klep, Magron, Massé, and Volčič. The convergence of the certificates does not require that the Hamiltonian be frustration-free. We prove that the resulting certificates have polynomial size at fixed degree and converge asymptotically (in fact, at level $n$), by showing that all allowed representations of the algebra correspond to the second exterior power $\wedge^2(\mathbb{C}^{2^n})$, which encodes the sum of the two smallest eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian. We also give an example showing that for a commuting 1-local Hamiltonian, the hierarchy certifies a nontrivial lower bound on the spectral gap.</p>

            <p>"Pebble games," an abstraction from classical reversible computing, have found use in the design of quantum circuits for inherently sequential tasks. Gidney showed that allowing Hadamard basis measurements during pebble games can dramatically improve costs -- an extension termed "spooky pebble games" because the measurements leave temporary phase errors called ghosts. In this work, we define and study parallel spooky pebble games. Previous work by Blocki, Holman, and Lee (TCC 2022) and Gidney studied the benefits offered by either parallelism or spookiness individually; here we show that these resources can yield impressive gains when used together. First, we show by construction that a line graph of length $\ell$ can be pebbled in depth $2\ell$ (which is exactly optimal) using space $\leq 2.47\log \ell$. Then, to explore pebbling schemes using even less space, we use a highly optimized $A^*$ search implemented in Julia to find the lowest-depth parallel spooky pebbling possible for a range of concrete line graph lengths $\ell$ given a constant number of pebbles $s$. We show that these techniques can be applied to Regev's factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025) to significantly reduce the cost of its arithmetic. For example, we find that 4096-bit integers $N$ can be factored in multiplication depth 193, which outperforms the 680 required of previous variants of Regev and the 444 reported by Ekerå and Gärtner for Shor's algorithm (IACR Communications in Cryptology 2025). While space-optimized implementations of Shor's algorithm remain likely the best candidates for first quantum factorization of large integers, our results show that Regev's algorithm may have practical importance in the future, especially given the possibility of further optimization. Finally, we believe our pebbling techniques will find applications in quantum cryptanalysis beyond integer factorization.</p>

            <p>The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</p>

            <p>Estimating the state of an open quantum system monitored over time requires incorporating information from past measurements (filtering) and, for improved accuracy, also from future measurements (smoothing). While classical smoothing is well-understood within Bayesian framework, its quantum generalization has been challenging, leading to distinct and seemingly incompatible approaches. In this work, we resolve this conceptual divide by developing a comprehensive retrodictive framework for quantum state smoothing. We demonstrate that existing theories are special cases within our formalism, corresponding to different extended prior beliefs. Our theory unifies the field and naturally extends it to a broader class of scenarios. We also explore the behavior of updates when using different priors with the same marginal and prove that the upper and lower bounds on average entropy of smoothed states are achieved by the Petz-Fuchs smoothed state and the CLHS smoothed state, respectively. Our results establish that quantum state smoothing is fundamentally a retrodictive process, finally bringing it into a closer analogy with classical smoothing.</p>

            <h2>Random unitaries that conserve energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Mao, Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</p>

            <p>We show that all Clifford circuits under interspersed depolarizing noise lose memory of their input exponentially quickly, even when given access to a constant supply of fresh qubits in arbitrary states. This is somewhat surprising given the result of Aharonov et al. [STOC1997] which gives a fault-tolerant protocol for general quantum circuits using a supply of fresh qubits. Our result shows that such a protocol is impossible using only Clifford gates demonstrating that non-Clifford gates are fundamentally required to store information for long periods of time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Layden, Ryan Sweke, Vojtěch Havlíček, Anirban Chowdhury, Kirill Neklyudov</p>
            <p>Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative models that progressively transform probability distributions according to learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally related to the Schrödinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples) for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem, plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models, such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Given a positive integer k, it is natural to ask for a formula for the distance between a given density matrix (i.e., mixed quantum state) and the set of density matrices of rank at most k. This problem has already been solved when "distance" is measured in the trace or Frobenius norm. We solve it for all other unitary similarity invariant norms. We also present some consequences of our formula. For example, in the trace and Frobenius norms, the density matrix that is farthest from the set of low-rank density matrices is the maximally mixed state, but this is not true in many other unitary similarity invariant norms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayant Rao, Jens Eisert, Tommaso Guaita</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation is a central application of near-term quantum devices, pursued in both analog and digital architectures. A key challenge for both paradigms is the effect of imperfections and noise on predictive power. In this work, we present a rigorous and physically transparent comparison of the stability of digital and analog quantum simulators under a variety of perturbative noise models. We provide rigorous worst- and average-case error bounds for noisy quantum simulation of local observables. We find that the two paradigms show comparable scaling in the worst case, while exhibiting different forms of enhanced error cancellation on average. We further analyze Gaussian and Brownian noise processes, deriving concentration bounds that capture typical deviations beyond worst-case guarantees. These results provide a unified framework for quantifying the robustness of noisy quantum simulations and identify regimes where digital methods have intrinsic advantages and when we can see similar behavior.</p>

            <p>We present a platform-agnostic modular architecture that addresses the increasingly fragmented landscape of quantum computing benchmarking by decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into independent, interoperable components. Supporting over 20 benchmark variants ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing suite.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Bluhm, Marius Lemm, Tim Möbus, Oliver Siebert</p>
            <p>We present a modular algorithm for learning external potentials in continuous-space free-fermion models including Coulomb potentials in any dimension. Compared to the lattice-based approaches, the continuum presents new mathematical challenges: the state space is infinite-dimensional and the Hamiltonian contains the Laplacian, which is unbounded in the continuum and thus produces an unbounded speed of information propagation. Our framework addresses these difficulties through novel optimization methods or information-propagation bounds in combination with a priori regularity assumptions on the external potential. The resulting algorithm provides a unified and robust approach that covers both Coulomb interactions and other classes of physically relevant potentials. One possible application is the characterization of charge and position of nuclei and ions in quantum chemistry. Our results thus lay the foundation for a scalable and generalizable toolkit to explore fermionic systems governed by continuous-space interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alvan Arulandu, Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel Kane, Jerry Li</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of agnostic tomography with \emph{mixed state} ansatz, and specifically, the natural ansatz class of product mixed states. In more detail, given $N$ copies of an $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which is $\epsilon$-close to a product mixed state $\pi$, the goal is to output a nearly-optimal product mixed state approximation to $\rho$. While there has been a flurry of recent work on agnostic tomography, prior work could only handle pure state ansatz, such as product states or stabilizer states. Here we give an algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states which finds a product state which is $O(\epsilon \log 1 / \epsilon)$ close to $\rho$ which uses polynomially many copies of $\rho$, and which runs in polynomial time. Moreover, our algorithm only uses single-qubit, single-copy measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm that achieves any non-trivial agnostic tomography guarantee for any class of mixed state ansatz. Our algorithm proceeds in two main conceptual steps, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we demonstrate a novel, black-box efficient reduction from agnostic tomography of product mixed states to the classical task of \emph{robustly learning binary product distributions} -- a textbook problem in robust statistics. We then demonstrate a nearly-optimal efficient algorithm for the classical task of robustly learning a binary product, answering an open problem in the literature. Our approach hinges on developing a new optimal certificate of closeness for binary product distributions that can be leveraged algorithmically via a carefully defined convex relaxation. Finally, we complement our upper bounds with a lower bound demonstrating that adaptivity is information-theoretically necessary for our agnostic tomography task, so long as the algorithm only uses single-qubit two-outcome projective measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lynn Engelberts, Yanlin Chen, Amin Shiraz Gilani, Maya-Iggy van Hoof, Stacey Jeffery, Ronald de Wolf</p>
            <p>The assumed hardness of the Shortest Vector Problem in high-dimensional lattices is one of the cornerstones of post-quantum cryptography. The fastest known heuristic attacks on SVP are via so-called sieving methods. While these still take exponential time in the dimension $d$, they are significantly faster than non-heuristic approaches and their heuristic assumptions are verified by extensive experiments. $k$-Tuple sieving is an iterative method where each iteration takes as input a large number of lattice vectors of a certain norm, and produces an equal number of lattice vectors of slightly smaller norm, by taking sums and differences of $k$ of the input vectors. Iterating these ''sieving steps'' sufficiently many times produces a short lattice vector. The fastest attacks (both classical and quantum) are for $k=2$, but taking larger $k$ reduces the amount of memory required for the attack. In this paper we improve the quantum time complexity of 3-tuple sieving from $2^{0.3098 d}$ to $2^{0.2846 d}$, using a two-level amplitude amplification aided by a preprocessing step that associates the given lattice vectors with nearby ''center points'' to focus the search on the neighborhoods of these center points. Our algorithm uses $2^{0.1887d}$ classical bits and QCRAM bits, and $2^{o(d)}$ qubits. This is the fastest known quantum algorithm for SVP when total memory is limited to $2^{0.1887d}$.</p>

            <p>We perform sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with spin ensembles which are polarized by nitrogen vacancy centers (NV centers) in diamond at room-temperature. With a near shot-noise-limited photoluminescence detection and a highly uniform magnetic field, we resolve sharp NMR features arising from multiple spin clusters. In particular, we investigate the coupling between nuclear spins and NV centers in the neutral and negatively charged states. Further, we perform high precision NMR and coherent control of families of carbon 13 nuclear spin ensembles in the $m_s$=0 level of the NV ground state. Applying an off-axis magnetic field reveals the various sites associated with the otherwise degenerate couplings of the carbon 13 sites around the NV electronic spin providing access to all the hyperfine tensor components. Last, we observe spectroscopic signatures of pairs of nuclear spins coupled to the same NV center. These results are relevant for ensemble measurements of dynamical polarization that currently rely on expensive nuclear magnetic resonance systems as well as for recently proposed nuclear spin gyroscopes.</p>

            <p>The instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) quantum circuit Born machine (QCBM) has been proposed as a promising quantum generative model over bitstrings. Recent works have shown that the training of IQP-QCBM is classically tractable w.r.t. the so-called Gaussian kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss function, while maintaining the potential of a quantum advantage for sampling itself. Nonetheless, the model has a number of aspects where improvements would be important for more general utility: (1) the basic model is known to be not universal - i.e. it is not capable of representing arbitrary distributions, and it was not known whether it is possible to achieve universality by adding hidden (ancillary) qubits; (2) a fixed Gaussian kernel used in the MMD loss can cause training issues, e.g., vanishing gradients. In this paper, we resolve the first question and make decisive strides on the second. We prove that for an $n$-qubit IQP generator, adding $n + 1$ hidden qubits makes the model universal. For the latter, we propose a kernel-adaptive training method, where the kernel is adversarially trained. We show that in the kernel-adaptive method, the convergence of the MMD value implies weak convergence in distribution of the generator. We also analytically analyze the limitations of the MMD-based training method. Finally, we verify the performance benefits on the dataset crafted to spotlight improvements by the suggested method. The results show that kernel-adaptive training outperforms a fixed Gaussian kernel in total variation distance, and the gap increases with the dataset dimensionality. These modifications and analyses shed light on the limits and potential of these new quantum generative methods, which could offer the first truly scalable insights in the comparative capacities of classical versus quantum models, even without access to scalable quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Completeness for Fault Equivalence of Clifford ZX Diagrams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Rüsch, Benjamin Rodatz, Aleks Kissinger</p>
            <p>Two circuits are considered to be equivalent under noise if the effect of faults on one circuit is no worse than the effect of faults on the other circuit. We call this relationship fault equivalence. Fault equivalence offers a way to transform circuits while provably preserving their fault-tolerant properties, enabling a framework for fault-tolerant circuit synthesis and optimisation that is correct by construction. The ZX calculus, a set of graphical rewrite rules for quantum computations, provides a useful tool for manipulating circuits while preserving fault equivalence. For this, the usual set of ZX rewrites has to be restricted to not only preserve the underlying linear map represented by the diagram but also fault equivalence. In this work, we provide a set of ZX rewrites that are sound and complete for fault equivalence of Clifford ZX diagrams. This means that any equivalence that can be derived using the proposed rules is certain to be correct, and any correct equivalence can be derived using only these rules. For this, we utilise diagrammatic constructions called fault gadgets to reason about arbitrary, possibly correlated Pauli faults in ZX diagrams. Fault gadgets allow us to separate the diagram into a fault-free part, which captures the noise-free behaviour of a diagram, and a noisy part that enumerates the effects of all possible faults. Using this, we provide a unique normal form for ZX diagrams under noise and show that any diagram can be brought into this normal form using our proposed rule set.</p>

Furthermore, we show that the game can be seen as the "or" of two games that each do not have quantum advantage. Lastly, we investigate the behavior of the game with respect to parallel repetition in the classical, quantum and non-signalling case and obtain perfect parallel repetition of the non-signalling value if Feige's game is repeated an even amount of times.</p>

            <p>We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</p>

            <p>Community detection is a foundational problem in data science. Its natural extension to hypergraphs captures higher-order correlations beyond pairwise interactions. In this work, we develop a quantum algorithm for hypergraph community detection that achieves a quartic quantum speedup over the best known classical algorithm, along with superpolynomial savings in space. Our algorithm is based on the Kikuchi method, which we extend beyond previously considered problems such as Tensor PCA and $p$XORSAT to a broad family of generalized stochastic block models. To demonstrate (near) optimality of this method, we prove matching lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors) in the low-degree framework, showing that the algorithm saturates a smooth statistical-computational tradeoff. The quantum speedup arises from a quantized version of the Kikuchi method and is based on the efficient preparation of a guiding state correlated with the underlying community structure. Our work suggests that prior quantum speedups using the Kikuchi method are sufficiently robust to encompass a broader set of problems than previously believed; we conjecture that a quantity known as marginal order characterizes the existence of these quantum speedups.</p>

            <p>We present a generic compiler that converts any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ protocol into a succinct interactive argument where the communication and the verifier are classical, and where post-quantum soundness relies on the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of the Learning with Errors ($\mathsf{LWE}$) problem. Prior to this work, such a compiler for $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ was given by Kalai, Lombardi, Vaikuntanathan and Yang (STOC 2022), but the post-quantum soundness of this compiler is still under investigation. More generally, our compiler can be applied to any $\mathsf{QIP}$ protocol which is sound only against semi-malicious provers that follow the prescribed protocol, but with possibly malicious initial state. Our compiler consists of two steps. We first show that if a language $\mathcal{L}$ has a $\mathsf{QIP}$ with semi-malicious soundness, where the prover runs in time $T$, then $\mathcal{L} \in \mathsf{QMATIME}(T)$. Then we construct a succinct classical argument for any such language, where the communication complexity grows polylogarithmically with $T$, under the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of $\mathsf{LWE}$.</p>

            <p>Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.</p>

            <p>Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian learning protocols are essential tools to benchmark quantum computers and simulators. Yet rigorous methods for time-dependent Hamiltonians and Lindbladians remain scarce despite their wide use. We close this gap by learning the time-dependent evolution of a locally interacting $n$-qubit system on a graph of effective dimension $D$ using only preparation of product Pauli eigenstates, evolution under the time-dependent generator for given times, and measurements in product Pauli bases. We assume the time-dependent parameters are well approximated by functions in a known space of dimension $m$ admitting stable interpolation, e.g. by polynomials. Our protocol outputs functions approximating these coefficients to accuracy $\epsilon$ on an interval with success probability $1-\delta$, requiring only $O\big(\epsilon^{-2}poly(m)\log(n\delta^{-1})\big)$ samples and $poly(n,m)$ pre/postprocessing. Importantly, the scaling in $m$ is polynomial, whereas naive extensions of previous methods scale exponentially. The method estimates time derivatives of observable expectations via interpolation, yielding well-conditioned linear systems for the generator's coefficients. The main difficulty in the time-dependent setting is to evaluate these coefficients at finite times while preserving a controlled link between derivatives and dynamical parameters. Our innovation is to combine Lieb-Robinson bounds, process shadows, and semidefinite programs to recover the coefficients efficiently at constant times. Along the way, we extend state-of-the-art Lieb-Robinson bounds on general graphs to time-dependent, dissipative dynamics, a contribution of independent interest. These results provide a scalable tool to verify state-preparation procedures (e.g. adiabatic protocols) and characterize time-dependent noise in quantum devices.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of protocols that localize entanglement in large multi-qubit states onto a subset of qubits by measuring the remaining qubits. We use the maximal average n-tangle that can be generated on a fixed subsystem by measuring its complement -- either with local or global measurements -- as our key figure of merit. These quantities are known respectively as the localizable entanglement (LE) and the entanglement of assistance (EA). We build upon the work of [arXiv:2411.04080] that proposed a polynomial-time test, based on the EA, for whether it is possible to transform certain graph states into others using local measurements. We show, using properties of the EA, that this test is effective and useful in large systems for a wide range of sizes of the measured subsystem. In particular, we use this test to demonstrate the surprising result that general local unitaries and global measurements will typically not provide an advantage over the more experimentally feasible local Clifford unitaries and local Pauli measurements in transforming large linear cluster states into GHZ states. Finally, we derive concentration inequalities for the LE and EA over Haar-random states which indicate that the localized entanglement structure has a striking dependence on the locality of the measurement. In deriving these concentration inequalities, we develop several technical tools that may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</p>

            <h2>The quantum communication power of indefinite causal order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanqiang Zhao, Benchi Zhao, Giulio Chiribella</p>
            <p>Quantum theory is in principle compatible with scenarios where physical processes take place in an indefinite causal order, a possibility that was shown to yield advantages in several information processing tasks. However, advantages in communication, the most basic form of information processing, have so far remained controversial and hard to prove. Here we develop a framework that can be used to rigorously assess the role of causal order in a scenario where communication links are built by assembling multiple quantum devices. In this setting, we establish a clear-cut advantage of indefinite order in the one-shot transmission of classical messages. On the other hand, we also show that the advantage is not generic to all communication tasks. Notably, we find that indefinite order does not offer any advantage over shared entanglement in the asymptotic scenario where a large number of uses of the same communication device is employed. Overall, our results unveil non-trivial relations between communication, causal order, entanglement, and no-signaling resources in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Apers, Arjan Cornelissen, Samson Wang</p>
            <p>The complexity of matrix multiplication is a central topic in computer science. While the focus has traditionally been on exact algorithms, a long line of literature also considers randomized algorithms, which return an approximate solution in faster time. In this work, we adopt a unifying perspective that frames these randomized algorithms in terms of mean estimation. Using it, we first give refined analyses of classical algorithms based on random walks by Cohen-Lewis (`99), and based on sketching by Sarlós (`06) and Drineas-Kannan-Mahoney (`06). We then propose an improvement on Cohen-Lewis that yields a single classical algorithm that is faster than all the other approaches, if we assume no use of (exact) fast matrix multiplication as a subroutine. Second, we demonstrate a quantum speedup on top of these algorithms by using the recent quantum multivariate mean estimation algorithm by Cornelissen-Hamoudi-Jerbi (`22).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Karaiskos, Dorian Rudolph, Johannes Jakob Meyer, Jens Eisert, Sevag Gharibian</p>
            <p>Classical shadows are succinct classical representations of quantum states which allow one to encode a set of properties P of a quantum state rho, while only requiring measurements on logarithmically many copies of rho in the size of P. In this work, we initiate the study of verification of classical shadows, denoted classical shadow validity (CSV), from the perspective of computational complexity, which asks: Given a classical shadow S, how hard is it to verify that S predicts the measurement statistics of a quantum state? We show that even for the elegantly simple classical shadow protocol of [Huang, Kueng, Preskill, Nature Physics 2020] utilizing local Clifford measurements, CSV is QMA-complete. This hardness continues to hold for the high-dimensional extension of said protocol due to [Mao, Yi, and Zhu, PRL 2025]. Among other results, we also show that CSV for exponentially many observables is complete for a quantum generalization of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, yielding the first natural complete problem for such a class.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aram W. Harrow, Angus Lowe, Freek Witteveen</p>
            <p>A fundamental task in quantum information is to approximate a pure quantum state in terms of sparse states or, for a bipartite system, states of bounded Schmidt rank. The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations. This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for computing maximum-entropy distributions.</p>

            <h2>High-Rate Surgery: towards constant-overhead logical operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo Zheng, Liang Jiang, Qian Xu</p>
            <p>Scalable quantum computation requires not only quantum codes with low memory overhead but also encoded operations with low space-time overhead. High rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes address the former by achieving a high information-encoding rate, yet existing methods for implementing logical operations often suffer from a low information-processing rate, leading to substantial space-time costs. Here, we introduce high-rate surgery, a general scheme that can perform extensive, addressable logical Pauli-product measurements in parallel on arbitrary qLDPC codes using a shared ancilla system, attaining nearly constant space-time overhead. We develop both algebraic and randomized ancilla constructions and demonstrate, using the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ Gross code and new instances of qLDPC codes (e.g., $[[1125, 245, \leq 10]]$) with encoding rate up to $25\%$, that up to hundreds of randomly sampled logical measurements can be executed simultaneously with a total space-time overhead around a factor of two of that of memory experiments. Our results address a major bottleneck for performing complex, addressable logical operations on qLDPC codes in practice, advancing the prospect of scalable, constant-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thi Ha Kyaw, Guillermo Romero, Gaurav Saxena</p>
            <p>A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k-Designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Laracuente</p>
            <p>A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago Bergamaschi, Chi-Fang Chen, Umesh Vazirani</p>
            <p>Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ainesh Bakshi, Allen Liu, Ankur Moitra, Ewin Tang</p>
            <p>A central challenge in quantum physics is to understand the structural properties of many-body systems, both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium. For classical systems, we have a unified perspective which connects structural properties of systems at thermal equilibrium to the Markov chain dynamics that mix to them. We lack such a perspective for quantum systems: there is no framework to translate the quantitative convergence of the Markovian evolution into strong structural consequences. We develop a general framework that brings the breadth and flexibility of the classical theory to quantum Gibbs states at high temperature. At its core is a natural quantum analog of a Dobrushin condition; whenever this condition holds, a concise path-coupling argument proves rapid mixing for the corresponding Markovian evolution. The same machinery bridges dynamic and structural properties: rapid mixing yields exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI) without restrictions on the size of the probed subsystems, resolving a central question in the theory of open quantum systems. Our key technical insight is an optimal transport viewpoint which couples quantum dynamics to a linear differential equation, enabling precise control over how local deviations from equilibrium propagate to distant sites.</p>

            <p>We investigate the role of energy, i.e. average photon number, as a resource in the computational complexity of bosonic systems. We show three sets of results: (1. Energy growth rates) There exist bosonic gate sets which increase energy incredibly rapidly, obtaining e.g. infinite energy in finite/constant time. We prove these high energies can make computing properties of bosonic computations, such as deciding whether a given computation will attain infinite energy, extremely difficult, formally undecidable. (2. Lower bounds on computational power) More energy ``='' more computational power. For example, certain gate sets allow poly-time bosonic computations to simulate PTOWER, the set of deterministic computations whose runtime scales as a tower of exponentials with polynomial height. Even just exponential energy and $O(1)$ modes suffice to simulate NP, which, importantly, is a setup similar to that of the recent bosonic factoring algorithm of [Brenner, Caha, Coiteux-Roy and Koenig (2024)]. For simpler gate sets, we show an energy hierarchy theorem. (3. Upper bounds on computational power) Bosonic computations with polynomial energy can be simulated in BQP, ``physical'' bosonic computations with arbitrary finite energy are decidable, and the gate set consisting of Gaussian gates and the cubic phase gate can be simulated in PP, with exponential bound on energy, improving upon the previous PSPACE upper bound. Finally, combining upper and lower bounds yields no-go theorems for a continuous-variable Solovay--Kitaev theorem for gate sets such as the Gaussian and cubic phase gates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Maltesson, Ludvig Rodung, Niklas Budinger, Giulia Ferrini, Cameron Calcluth</p>
            <p>We examine the ability of gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers to outperform qubit or discrete-variable quantum computers. Gate-based continuous-variable operations refer to operations constructed using a polynomial sequence of elementary gates from a specific finite set, i.e., those selected from the set of Gaussian operations and cubic phase gates. Our results show that for a fixed energy of the system, there is no superpolynomial computational advantage in using gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers over discrete-variable ones. The proof of this result consists of defining a framework - of independent interest - that maps quantum circuits between the paradigms of continuous- to discrete-variables. This framework allows us to conclude that a realistic gate-based model of continuous-variable quantum computers, consisting of states and operations that have a total energy that is polynomial in the number of modes, can be simulated efficiently using discrete-variable devices. We utilize the stabilizer subsystem decomposition [Shaw et al., PRX Quantum 5, 010331] to map continuous-variable states to discrete-variable counterparts, which allows us to find the error of approximating continuous-variable quantum computers with discrete-variable ones in terms of the energy of the continuous-variable system and the dimension of the corresponding encoding qudits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Yang, Elham Kashefi, Harold Ollivier</p>
            <p>The rapid advance of quantum hardware is spotlighting pre-fault-tolerant tasks that may no longer be efficiently validated by classical means and are likely to run on potentially untrusted remote quantum servers. This motivates problem-independent verification protocols with rigorous guarantees. The Verifiable Blind Quantum Computation (VBQC) protocol provides delegated computation where the composable security spans the confidentiality and integrity of the computation. However, the success of these cryptographic protocols, especially their low space overhead, is unfortunately confined to problems that admit an algorithm whose output can be amplified through majority voting toward the correct solution. This leaves various notable near-term applications relying on observable estimation without efficient verification protocols. To address these needs, we introduce a protocol implementing Secure Delegated Observable Estimation (SDOE), which efficiently verifies observable estimation performed on an untrusted quantum machine. More precisely, it guarantees that the computed estimate is within some $\epsilon>0$ of the true expectation value or else it aborts. The required overhead is limited to adding test rounds that are not more complex than the unprotected computation that needs to be performed to implement the desired measurement on a given fiducial state; and in addition, the security error is negligible in the total number of rounds of the protocol.</p>

            <p>Code-switching is a powerful technique in quantum error correction that allows one to leverage the complementary strengths of different codes to achieve fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. However, existing code-switching protocols that encapsulate recent generalized lattice surgery approaches often either require many rounds of measurements to ensure fault-tolerance or suffer from low code rates. We present a single-shot, universal protocol that uses code-switching between high-rate quantum codes to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation. To our best knowledge, our work contains the first universal fault-tolerant quantum computation protocol that achieves what we term single-shot universality on high-rate codes that is characterized by (i) single-shot error correction, (ii) single-shot state preparation, as well as (iii) universal logical gates and logical measurements with constant depth circuits. We achieve this feat with single-shot code-switching between constant-rate 2D hypergraph product (HGP) codes and high-rate 3D HGP codes that can be viewed as a generalization of Bombin's dimensional jump for color codes and Hillmann et al.'s single-shot lattice surgery for higher-dimensional topological codes. In addition, we prove the fault-tolerance of our code-switching protocol under both the adversarial and local-stochastic noise models. We introduce a vastly simpler recipe to construct high-rate 3D HGP codes with transversal CCZ gates that grants immense flexibility in the choice of expander graphs and local codes, allowing us to expand the search space for codes with good parameters and interesting logical gates. Our work opens an alternative path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with low space-time overhead by circumventing the need for magic state distillation.</p>

We analyze the role of locality in the coupling to the environment of the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results obtained for two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes, or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states numerical methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a small portion of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.</p>

            <p>In the framework of quantum mechanics over a quadratic extension of the ultrametric field of p-adic numbers, we introduce a notion of tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. To this end, following a standard approach, we first consider the algebraic tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. We next define a suitable norm on this linear space. It turns out that, in the p-adic framework, this norm is the analogue of the projective norm associated with the tensor product of real or complex normed spaces. Eventually, by metrically completing the resulting p-adic normed space, and equipping it with a suitable inner product, we obtain the tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. That this is indeed the correct p-adic counterpart of the tensor product of complex Hilbert spaces is also certified by establishing a natural isomorphism between this p-adic Hilbert space and the corresponding Hilbert-Schmidt class. Since the notion of subspace of a p-adic Hilbert space is highly nontrivial, we finally study the tensor product of subspaces, stressing both the analogies and the significant differences with respect to the standard complex case. These findings should provide us with the mathematical foundations necessary to explore quantum entanglement in the p-adic setting, with potential applications in the emerging field of p-adic quantum information theory.</p>

One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators.

Here we demonstrate, through comprehensive finite element and variational Monte-Carlo modelling, that a reconfigurable three-dimensional array of needle shaped beams can selectively switch the quantum optical response of individual InAs nanorods embedded in GaAs. By tuning the local non resonant intensity pattern the exciton and biexciton energies were calculated, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) windows were examined, and correspondingly near-field diffraction carpets were dynamically reshaped. A single parameter the activation ratio between illuminated and dark nanorods provides continuous control over photoluminescence peak position (80 meV) and EIT bandwidth (six times). We further predict fully programmable Talbot self-imaging in nanorod arrays with sub-wavelength pitch. Importantly, the observed Talbot carpets enable spatially resolved identification of which nanorods were excited, offering a powerful diagnostic for verifying structured-light activation schemes. The concept offers a low crosstalk, wafer scale route toward reconfigurable quantum emitters, tunable diffractive optics and on-chip slow-light components.</p>

            <p>Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy. We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.</p>

            <p>Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Grier, Daniel M. Kane, Jackson Morris, Anthony Ostuni, Kewen Wu</p>
            <p>We construct a family of distributions $\{\mathcal{D}_n\}_n$ with $\mathcal{D}_n$ over $\{0, 1\}^n$ and a family of depth-$7$ quantum circuits $\{C_n\}_n$ such that $\mathcal{D}_n$ is produced exactly by $C_n$ with the all zeros state as input, yet any constant-depth classical circuit with bounded fan-in gates evaluated on any binary product distribution has total variation distance $1 - e^{-\Omega(n)}$ from $\mathcal{D}_n$. Moreover, the quantum circuits we construct are geometrically local and use a relatively standard gate set: Hadamard, controlled-phase, CNOT, and Toffoli gates. All previous separations of this type suffer from some undesirable constraint on the classical circuit model or the quantum circuits witnessing the separation. Our family of distributions is inspired by the Parity Halving Problem of Watts, Kothari, Schaeffer, and Tal (STOC, 2019), which built on the work of Bravyi, Gosset, and König (Science, 2018) to separate shallow quantum and classical circuits for relational problems.</p>

            <p>Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic. Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by Mølmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schrödinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement without Spin-Analyzing Power Dependence at the Colliders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junle Pei, Tianjun Li, Lina Wu, Xiqing Hao, Xiaochuan Wang</p>
            <p>We study the quantum entanglement at the colliders which is independent of the spin-analyzing powers. Taking $\Lambda(\to p\pi^-)\bar{\Lambda}(\to \bar{p}\pi^+)$ as an example, we investigate whether quantum entanglement in fermion pairs produced at colliders can be certified by using only angular information from final-state decays, while remaining independent of the parity-violating decay parameters $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$. Building on a general decomposition of any angular observable in terms of Wigner d-functions, we show that the expectation value must take the form $\mathcal{O}_0+\mathcal{O}_1\alpha_\Lambda+\mathcal{O}_2\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}+\mathcal{O}_3\alpha_\Lambda\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$, with coefficients $\mathcal{O}_i$ ($i=0,1,2,3$) linear in the spin-density matrix elements $\alpha_{k,j}\alpha^*_{m,n}$. We obtain the value ranges of observables over the general and separable spaces of $\alpha_{k,j}$, and demonstrate a sufficient entanglement condition for pure states, extending it to mixed states by convexity. In constructing an $\alpha_\Lambda$- and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$-independent witness from angular observables alone, we find that there are obstacles to probe quantum entanglement via the inequality-type and ratio-type ways. Finally, we present the successful constructions with additional spin information: for the process of $e^+e^-\to J/\Psi\to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ at $e^+ e^-$ collider, independent spin information provided by beam-axis selection enables the construction of normalized observables $f_i~(i=1,2)$ that are insensitive to $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$; if their measured values lie in $\left[-1,-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\cup\left(\tfrac{1}{2},1\right]$, entanglement is certified, irrespective of purity or mixedness.</p>

            <h2>Faraday patterns, spin textures, spin-spin correlations and competing instabilities in a driven spin-1 antiferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaishakh Kargudri, Sandra M. Jose, Rejish Nath</p>
            <p>We study the formation of transient Faraday patterns and spin textures in driven quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the periodic modulation of $s$-wave scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$, starting from the anti-ferromagnetic phase. This phase is characterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is gapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of the modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday patterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is characterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven above the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin vectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the driven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the gap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices that do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components. Below the gap, the spin texture exhibits irregular ferromagnetic patches with opposite polarizations. The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension exhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence in quasi-two-dimension. Under the $a_2$-modulation, the density patterns dominate irrespective of the driving frequency, unless the spin-dependent interaction strength is sufficiently smaller than that of the spin-independent interaction. The intriguing scenario of competing instability can emerge when both scattering lengths are simultaneously modulated. Finally, we show that the competing instabilities result in a complex relationship between the population transfer and the strength of the quadratic Zeeman field, while keeping all other parameters constant.</p>

            <p>Understanding the relationship between many-body localization and spectra in non-Hermitian many-body systems is crucial. In a one-dimensional clean, long-range interaction-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization system, we have discovered the coexistence of static and dynamic spectral real-complex phase transitions, along with many-body ergodic-localized phase transitions. The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum variance and fluctuations for Walsh-quantized baker's maps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Shou</p>
            <p>The Walsh-quantized baker's maps are models for quantum chaos on the torus. We show that for all baker's map scaling factors $D\ge2$ except for $D=4$, typically (in the sense of Haar measure on the eigenspaces, which are degenerate) the empirical distribution of the scaled matrix element fluctuations $\sqrt{N}\{\langle \varphi^{(j)}|\operatorname{Op}_{k,\ell}(a)|\varphi^{(j)}\rangle-\int_{\mathbb{T}^2}a\}_{j=1}^{N}$ for a random eigenbasis $\{\varphi^{(j)}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ is asymptotically Gaussian in the semiclassical limit $N\to\infty$, with variance given in terms of classical baker's map correlations. This determines the precise rate of convergence in the quantum ergodic theorem for these eigenbases. We obtain a version of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for these eigenstates, including a limiting complex Gaussian distribution for the off-diagonal matrix elements, with variances also given in terms of classical correlations. The presence of the classical correlations highlights that these eigenstates, while random, have microscopic correlations that differentiate them from Haar random vectors. For the single value $D=4$, the Gaussianity of the matrix element fluctuations depends on the values of the classical observable on a fractal subset of the torus.</p>

            <h2>Computing moment polytopes - with a focus on tensors, entanglement and matrix multiplication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim van den Berg, Matthias Christandl, Vladimir Lysikov, Harold Nieuwboer, Michael Walter, Jeroen Zuiddam</p>
            <p>Tensors are fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Their study through algebraic geometry and representation theory has proved very fruitful in the context of algebraic complexity theory and quantum information. In particular, moment polytopes have been understood to play a key role. In quantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes) provide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer a geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they underpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More recently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field of scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization. Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still unknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ only sporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class of reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J. Lie Theory 2002). This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with certainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in $\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability those in $\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit moment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results.</p>

            <h2>Fractional quantum Hall states under density decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Wang, Ruihua Fan, Tianle Wang, Samuel J. Garratt, Ehud Altman</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.</p>

            <h2>Photon-assisted entanglement creation by minimum-error generalized quantum measurements in the strong coupling regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Z. Bernád, G. Alber</p>
            <p>We explore possibilities of entangling two distant material qubits with the help of an optical radiation field in the regime of strong quantum electrodynamical coupling with almost resonant interaction. For this purpose the optimum generalized field measurements are determined which are capable of preparing a two-qubit Bell state by postselection with minimum error. It is demonstrated that in the strong-coupling regime some of the recently found limitations of the non-resonant weak-coupling regime can be circumvented successfully due to characteristic quantum electrodynamical quantum interference effects. In particular, in the absence of photon loss it is possible to postselect two-qubit Bell states with fidelities close to unity by a proper choice of the relevant interaction time. Even in the presence of photon loss this strong-coupling regime offers interesting perspectives for creating spatially well-separated Bell pairs with high fidelities, high success probabilities, and high repetition rates which are relevant for future realizations of quantum repeaters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gereon Koßmann, Lennart Binkowski, Lauritz van Luijk, Timo Ziegler, René Schwonnek</p>
            <p>Despite its popularity, several empirical and theoretical studies suggest that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has persistent issues in providing a substantial practical advantage. Numerical results for few qubits and shallow circuits are, at best, ambiguous, and the well-studied barren plateau phenomenon draws a rather sobering picture for deeper circuits. However, as more and more sophisticated strategies are proposed to circumvent barren plateaus, it stands to reason which issues are actually fundamental and which merely constitute - admittedly difficult - engineering tasks. By shifting the scope from the usually considered parameter landscape to the quantum state space's geometry we can distinguish between problems that are fundamentally difficult to solve, independently of the parameterization, and those for which there could at least exist a favorable parameterization. Here, we find clear evidence for a 'no free lunch'-behavior of QAOA on a general optimization task with no further structure; individual cases have, however, to be analyzed more carefully. Based on our analysis, we propose and justify a performance indicator for the deep-circuit QAOA that can be accessed by solely evaluating statistical properties of the classical objective function. We further discuss the various favorable properties a generic QAOA instance has in the asymptotic regime of infinitely many gates, and elaborate on the immanent drawbacks of finite circuits. We provide several numerical examples of a deep-circuit QAOA method based on local search strategies and find that - in alignment with our performance indicator - some special function classes, like QUBOs, indeed admit a favorable optimization landscape.</p>

            <p>In this work, we show that learning the output distributions of brickwork random quantum circuits is average-case hard in the statistical query model. This learning model is widely used as an abstract computational model for most generic learning algorithms. In particular, for brickwork random quantum circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $d$, we show three main results: - At super logarithmic circuit depth $d=\omega(\log(n))$, any learning algorithm requires super polynomially many queries to achieve a constant probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. - There exists a $d=O(n)$, such that any learning algorithm requires $\Omega(2^n)$ queries to achieve a $O(2^{-n})$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. - At infinite circuit depth $d\to\infty$, any learning algorithm requires $2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ many queries to achieve a $2^{-2^{\Omega(n)}}$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance. As an auxiliary result of independent interest, we show that the output distribution of a brickwork random quantum circuit is constantly far from any fixed distribution in total variation distance with probability $1-O(2^{-n})$, which confirms a variant of a conjecture by Aaronson and Chen.</p>

The underlying reservoir dynamics through which such input state evolves is implemented using the coined quantum walk of high-dimensional photonic orbital angular momentum, and performing projective measurements over a fixed basis. We demonstrate how the reconstruction of an unknown polarization state does not need a careful characterization of the measurement apparatus and is robust to experimental imperfections, thus representing a promising route for resource-economic state characterisation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zimu Li, Han Zheng, Yunfei Wang, Liang Jiang, Zi-Wen Liu, Junyu Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum information processing in the presence of continuous symmetry is of wide importance and exhibits many novel physical and mathematical phenomena. SU(d) is a continuous group of particular interest since it represents a fundamental type of non-Abelian symmetry and also plays a vital role in quantum computation. Here, we explicate three particularly interesting applications of symmetric random unitaries in diverse contexts ranging from physics to quantum computing: information scrambling with non-Abelian conserved quantities, covariant quantum error correcting random codes, and geometric quantum machine learning. First, we show that, in the presence of SU(d) symmetry, the local conserved quantities would exhibit residual values even at $t \rightarrow \infty$ which decays as $\Omega(1/n^{3/2})$ under local Pauli basis for qubits and $\Omega(1/n^{(d+2)^2/2})$ under symmetric basis for general qudits with respect to the system size, in contrast to O(1/n) decay for U(1) case and the exponential decay for no-symmetry case in the sense of out-of-time ordered correlator. Second, we show that SU(d)-symmetric unitaries can be used to construct asymptotically optimal (in the sense of saturating the fundamental limits on the code error, or the approximate Eastin--Knill theorems) SU(d)-covariant codes that encode any constant number of logical qudits, extending [Kong & Liu; PRXQ 3, 020314 (2022)]. Finally, we derive an overpartameterization threshold via the quantum neural tangent kernel required for exponential convergence guarantee of generic ansatz for geometric quantum machine learning, which reveals that the number of parameters required scales only with the dimension of desired subspaces rather than the entire Hilbert space. Our work invites further research on quantum information with continuous symmetries, where the mathematical tools developed in this work are expected to be useful.</p>

            <p>Non-Markovian effects in the dynamics of an open system are typically characterized by non-monotonic information flows from the system to its environment or by information backflows from the environment to the system. Using a two-level system (TLS) coupled to a dissipative single-mode cavity, we demonstrate that the geometric decoherence of the open quantum system can serve as a reliable indicator of non-Markovian dynamics. This geometric approach also reveals finer details of the dynamics, such as the specific time points when non-Markovian behavior emerges. In particular, we show that the divergence of the geometric decoherence factor of the TLS can serve as a sufficient condition for non-Markovian dynamics, and in certain cases, it can even be both a necessary and sufficient condition.</p>

            <p>Fast quantum algorithms can solve important computational problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. However, little is known about whether quantum computing can speed up solving geometric problems. This article explores quantum advantages for the problem of finding the center of a sphere in vector spaces over finite fields, given samples of random points on the sphere. We prove that any classical algorithm for this task requires approximately as many samples as the dimension of the vector space, by a reduction to an old and basic algebraic result -- Warning's second theorem. On the other hand, we propose a quantum algorithm based on quantum walks that needs only a constant number of samples to find the center. Thus, an unbounded quantum advantage is revealed for a natural and intuitive geometric problem, which highlights the power of quantum computing in solving geometric problems.</p>

            <p>Reversing an unknown quantum evolution is of central importance to quantum information processing and fundamental physics, yet it remains a formidable challenge as conventional methods necessitate an infinite number of queries to fully characterize the quantum process. Here we introduce the Quantum Unitary Reversal Algorithm (QURA), a deterministic and exact approach to universally reverse arbitrary unknown unitary transformations using $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ calls of the unitary, where $d$ is the system dimension. Our quantum algorithm resolves a fundamental problem of time-reversal simulations for closed quantum systems by confirming the feasibility of reversing any unitary evolution without knowing the exact process. The algorithm also provides the construction of a key oracle for unitary inversion in many quantum algorithm frameworks, such as quantum singular value transformation. It notably reveals a sharp boundary between the quantum and classical computing realms and unveils a quadratic quantum advantage in computational complexity for this foundational task.</p>

            <p>Photonic quantum computation refers to quantum computation that uses photons as the physical system for doing the quantum computation. The field is largely divided between discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation. In the former, quantum information is represented by one or more modal properties (e.g. polarisation) that take on distinct values from a finite set. Quantum information is processed via operations on these modal properties (e.g. waveplates in the case of polarisation), and eventually measured using single-photon detectors. In CV photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic field that take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). Both CV and DV implementations have been realized experimentally; each has a unique set of challenges that need to be overcome to achieve scalable universal photonic quantum computation. It is possible to combine both DV and CV in a hybrid CV-DV fashion to overcome the limitations of either approach.</p>

The constructions are based on decomposing the non-Gaussian states into linear combinations of Gaussian states. We use an extension of the covariance matrix formalism to efficiently track relative phases in the superpositions of Gaussian states. We get an exact simulation algorithm, which costs quadratically with the number of Gaussian states required to represent the initial state, and an approximate simulation algorithm, which costs linearly with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficients associated with the superposition. We define measures of non-Gaussianity quantifying this simulation cost, which we call the Gaussian rank and the Gaussian extent. From the perspective of quantum resource theories, we investigate the properties of this type of non-Gaussianity measure and compute optimal decompositions for states relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing.</p>

            <p>The initialization of quantum states or Quantum State Preparation (QSP) is a basic subroutine in quantum algorithms. In the worst case, general QSP algorithms are expensive due to the application of multi-controlled gates required to build the quantum state. Here, we propose an algorithm that detects whether a given quantum state can be factored into substates, increasing the efficiency of compiling the QSP circuit when we initialize states with some level of unentanglement. The simplification is done by eliminating controls of quantum multiplexers, significantly reducing circuit depth and the number of CNOT gates with a better execution and compilation time than the previous QSP algorithms. Considering efficiency in terms of depth and number of CNOT gates, our method is competitive with the methods in the literature. However, when it comes to run-time and compilation efficiency, our result is significantly better, and the experiments show that by increasing the number of qubits, the gap between the temporal efficiency of the methods increases.</p>

They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.</p>

            <h2>Approximate Degrees of Multisymmetric Properties with Application to Quantum Claw Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiichiro Tani</p>
            <p>The claw problem is central in the fields of theoretical computer science as well as cryptography. The optimal quantum query complexity of the problem is known to be $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ for input functions $f\colon [F]\to Z$ and $g\colon [G]\to Z$. However, the lower bound was proved when the range $Z$ is sufficiently large (i.e., $|{Z}|=\Omega(FG)$). The current paper proves the lower bound holds even for every smaller range $Z$ with $|{Z}|\ge F+G$. This implies that $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ is tight for every such range. In addition, the lower bound $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+F^{1/3}G^{1/6}M^{1/6}\right)$ is provided for even smaller range $Z=[M]$ with every $M\in [2,F+G]$ by reducing the claw problem for $|{Z}|= F+G$. The proof technique is general enough to apply to any $k$-symmetric property (e.g., the $k$-claw problem), i.e., the Boolean function $\Phi$ on the set of $k$ functions with different-size domains and a common range such that $\Phi$ is invariant under the permutations over each domain and the permutations over the range. More concretely, it generalizes Ambainis's argument [Theory of Computing, 1(1):37-46] to the multiple-function case by using the notion of multisymmetric polynomials.</p>

            <p>Quantifying the resources available to a quantum computer appears to be necessary to separate quantum from classical computation. Among them, entanglement, nonstabilizerness and coherence are arguably of great significance. We introduce path coherence as a measure of the coherent paths interferences arising in a quantum computation. Leveraging the sum-over-paths formalism, we obtain a classical algorithm for estimating quantum transition amplitudes, the complexity of which scales with path coherence. As path coherence relates to the hardness of classical estimation of quantum transition amplitudes, it provides a new perspective on the role of coherence in quantum computational advantage. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have practical applications for simulating large classes of quantum computations with classical computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taku Mikuriya, Shintaro Fujiwara, Kein Yukiyoshi, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Naoki Ishikawa</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the search space of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, can be reduced using Grover adaptive search (GAS) with permutation preparation operator (PPO). To that end, we first revise the traditional quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of the QAP into a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) formulation, introducing a binary encoding method. Algebraic analyses in terms of the number of qubits, quantum gates, circuit depth, and query complexity are performed, which indicate that our proposed approach significantly reduces the search space size, improving convergence performance to the optimal solution compared to the conventional one. Furthermore, although the PPO for HUBO has a greater circuit depth than the PPO for QUBO, when the analysis is extended to the entire state preparation operator, both HUBO and QUBO exhibit comparable depths. Therefore, owing to its smaller number of variables, HUBO can be concluded to be more effective.</p>

            <p>Vibronic interactions between nuclear motion and electronic states are critical for the accurate modeling of photochemistry. However, accurate simulations of fully quantum non-adiabatic dynamics are often prohibitively expensive for classical methods beyond small systems. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm based on product formulas for simulating time evolution under a general vibronic Hamiltonian in real space, capable of handling an arbitrary number of electronic states and vibrational modes. We develop the first trotterization scheme for vibronic Hamiltonians beyond two electronic states and introduce an array of optimization techniques for the exponentiation of each fragment in the product formula, resulting in a remarkably low cost of implementation. To demonstrate practical relevance, we outline a proof-of-principle integration of our algorithm into a materials discovery pipeline for designing more efficient singlet fission-based organic solar cells. We estimate that $100$ fs of propagation using a second-order Trotter product formula for a $6$-state, $21$-mode model of exciton transport at an anthracene dimer requires $154$ qubits and $2.76 \times 10^6$ Toffoli gates. While a $4$-state, $246$-mode model describing charge transfer at an anthracene-fullerene interface requires $1053$ qubits and $2.66 \times 10^7$ Toffoli gates.</p>

            <p>We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer Rényi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of non-stabilizerness in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in non-stabilizerness at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Exponentially accurate open quantum simulation via randomized dissipation with minimal ancilla</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jumpei Kato, Kaito Wada, Kosuke Ito, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding complex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum algorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short circuit depth in terms of accuracy $\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all possible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space complexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important challenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general Lindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable estimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a minimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor expansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit compilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump operator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 + \lceil \log M \rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at most $M$ Pauli strings. Furthermore, the gate complexity depends on neither the number of terms in Hamiltonian nor the number of jump operators, owing to the random compilation. This work represents a significant step towards making open quantum system simulations more feasible on early fault-tolerant quantum computing devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denise Cocchiarella, Mari Carmen Bañuls</p>
            <p>We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.</p>

            <p>Massive quantum oscillators are finding increasing applications in proposals for high-precision quantum sensors and interferometric detection of weak forces. Although optimal estimation of certain properties of massive quantum oscillators such as phase shifts and displacements have strict counterparts in the theory of quantum estimation of the electromagnetic field, the phase space anisotropy of the massive oscillator is characterized by a length scale parameter that is an independent target for quantum estimation methods. We show that displaced squeezed states and excited eigenstates of a massive oscillator exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information for the length scale with respect to excitation number, and discuss asymptotically unbiased and efficient estimation allowing to achieve the predicted sensitivity. We construct a sequence of entangled states of two massive oscillators that provides a boost in length scale sensitivity equivalent to appending a third massive oscillator to a non-entangled system, and a state of $N$ oscillators exhibiting Heisenberg scaling with respect to the total energy.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Corr, Stefano Cusumano, Gabriele De Chiara</p>
            <p>Quantum collision models allow for the dynamics of open quantum systems to be described by breaking the environment into small segments, typically consisting of non-interacting harmonic oscillators or two-level systems. This work introduces structure within these environmental units via spring-like interactions between N coupled oscillators in a ring structure, initially prepared in a thermal state. Two models of interest are examined. The first highlights a case in which a continuous time evolution can be obtained, wherein the system interacts with the environment via a beam-splitter-like, energy-preserving, interaction. The resulting dynamics are analogous to those due to interactions with unstructured units prepared as squeezed thermal states. The second model highlights a case in which the continuous time limit for the evolution cannot be taken generally, requiring instead discrete-time propagation. Special cases in which the continuous time limit can be taken are also investigated, alongside the addition of a secondary environment to induce a steady state. The first and second laws of thermodynamics are verified for both examples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Girardi, Aadil Oufkir, Bartosz Regula, Marco Tomamichel, Mario Berta, Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\rho = \min_{\sigma_B} D(\rho_A\otimes \sigma_B\|\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothee Hoffreumon, Mischa P. Woods</p>
            <p>Quantum theory was radically different from the theories of nature which came before it. One key difference was its use of complex numbers. This opened a longstanding debate over whether quantum theory fundamentally requires complex numbers -- or if their use is merely a convenient choice. Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in a 2021 Nature article, a decisive argument was presented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers since real-number quantum theory is inconsistent with the postulates of quantum theory. In this work, we show that this conclusion was premature, and in actual fact, a real-number quantum theory is consistent with the postulates of quantum theory. Our theory retains key features such as representation locality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to the states). A direct consequence of our results is that quantum theory based on real or complex numbers are experimentally indistinguishable.</p>

            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</p>

            <p>The practical implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates faces significant challenges in simultaneously mitigating multiple operational errors arising from distinct physical mechanisms. These errors often span orders of magnitude in severity, and their respective suppression strategies may inherently conflict. In this work, we develop a universal multiobjective optimization framework for quantum gate design by integrating Pareto optimal solutions with an entropy-weight method. Using Rydberg-based nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates (affected by amplitude errors, detuning errors, and Rydberg decoherence) as a testbed, we theoretically demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm. The optimized gates exhibit enhanced fidelity and robustness compared to those derived from one-objective optimization strategies. Furthermore, this framework is readily adaptable to other quantum gate protocols and provides a robust foundation for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators, provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous.</p>

For the tensor network framework, our bounds indicate that bra-ket entanglement governs the interplay between two physical resources, the coherence and the magic. As bra-ket entanglement increases, the dominant resource that governs the complexity of the tensor network framework, quantified by entanglement, shifts from coherence to magic. For the stabilizer formalism approach, we find that magic is always the dominant resource regardless of bra-ket entanglement. This conclusion is obtained by developing an operator stabilizer formalism, which extends the standard stabilizer formalism for pure states and has additional advantages in simulating certain quantum circuits. Therefore, our results indicate that as bra-ket entanglement increases, the resource governing the complexity of the two approaches goes from different to the same.</p>

            <p>While the impact of locality restrictions on quantum dynamics and algorithmic complexity has been well studied in the general case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, the capabilities of time-independent protocols are less well understood. Using clock constructions, we show that the light cone for time-independent Hamiltonians, as captured by Lieb-Robinson bounds, is the same as that for time-dependent systems when local ancillas are allowed. More specifically, we develop time-independent protocols for approximate quantum state transfer with the same run-times as their corresponding time-dependent protocols. Given any piecewise-continuous Hamiltonian, our construction gives a time-independent Hamiltonian that implements its dynamics in the same time, up to error $\varepsilon$, at the cost of introducing a number of local ancilla qubits for each data qubit that is polylogarithmic in the number of qubits, the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivative (if it exists), the run time, and $1/\varepsilon$. We apply this construction to state transfer for systems with power-law-decaying interactions and one-dimensional nearest-neighbor systems with disordered interaction strengths. In both cases, this gives time-independent protocols with the same optimal light-cone-saturating run-times as their time-dependent counterparts.</p>

Here we give a complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</p>

            <h2>Fault Tolerance by Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Rodatz, Boldizsár Poór, Aleks Kissinger</p>
            <p>A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic transformations. To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification. To utilise fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We confirm the improved performance of our optimised circuits in simulation. We anticipate that fault equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation framework.</p>

            <h2>The Complexity of Thermalization in Finite Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhruv Devulapalli, T. C. Mooney, James D. Watson</p>
            <p>Thermalization is the process through which a physical system evolves toward a state of thermal equilibrium. Determining whether or not a physical system will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the Gibbs expectation value is PSPACE-complete. We also show that the related problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the microcanonical expectation value is contained in PSPACE and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. In light of recent results demonstrating undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.</p>

            <h2>Decomposition of multi-qutrit gates generated by Weyl-Heisenberg strings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Trisciani, Marco Cattaneo, Zoltán Zimborás</p>
            <p>Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for implementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates are typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for decomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in account. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing, we develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into single- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries generated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices). Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with identity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result also to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit rotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the layers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based implementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited to qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach yields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based implementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the routing challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited connectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss method, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to optimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled a realm of exotic phenomena absent in Hermitian systems, with the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) showcasing boundary-localized eigenstates driven by non-reciprocal interactions. Here, we introduce a new class of non-Hermitian systems exhibiting pure decay modes-eigenstates with pure, smooth exponential decay, devoid of the oscillatory wave patterns typical of traditional NHSE. Modeled as directed graphs with non-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined as the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel topological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling versatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with complicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices. Experimental validation using microwave resonant circuits confirms the predicted pure decay profiles. This discovery paves the way for potential applications in photonics, signal processing, and beyond, harnessing the unique topological properties of non-Hermitian networks</p>

            <h2>High-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation using phase-matched spectral islands in a zero-added-loss multiplexing architecture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey H. Shapiro, Clark Embleton, Michael G. Raymer, Brian J. Smith</p>
            <p>Spontaneous parametric down-converters (SPDCs) are the best available entanglement sources for distributing entanglement in a quantum internet. However, their intrinsically probabilistic nature, and their need to operate at low brightness to suppress multipair events, dictate that multiplexed SPDC arrays are required for high-rate distribution in that application. Early SPDC multiplexing proposals involved path switching, whose switching losses significantly degrade performance. The present paper proposes and analyzes a scheme for spectral multiplexing that provides entanglement-distribution rates well in excess of the state of the art. It builds on zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM)~[Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 19}, 054029 (2023)] for high-rate heralded entanglement generation, which does not require a switched array of SPDCs. Our ZALM's SPDCs rely on nonlinear crystals with $N_I$ phase-matched spectral islands, each generating two-mode squeezed-vacuum states. Also, our ZALM's multiplexing protocol uses both same-island and cross-island heralding, which allows the entanglement-delivery rate to approximately scale as $N_I^2$ in the realistic weak-squeezing regime. As a result, our scheme uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels than the original ZALM proposal, which may enable near-term implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear-linear duality for multipath quantum interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zheng, Jin-Shi Xu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</p>

            <p>We derive a new lower bound on the success probability of the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM) for worst-case quantum state discrimination among $m$ quantum states. Our bound is strictly tighter than the previously known Gram-matrix-based bound for $m\geq 4$. The proof adapts techniques from Barnum and Knill's analysis of the average-case PGM, applied here to the worst-case scenario. By comparing the PGM to the sequential measurement algorithm, we obtain a guarantee showing that, in the low-fidelity regime, the PGM's success probability decreases quadratically with respect to the maximum pairwise overlap, rather than linearly as in earlier bounds.</p>

            <p>We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinye Wei, Jungeng Zhou, Yi Shen, Jiahao Huang, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>Spin-squeezed states constitute a valuable entanglement resource capable of surpassing the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, spin-squeezed states only enable sub-SQL uncertainty within a narrow parametric window near some specific points. Identifying optimal measurement protocols for spin-squeezed states remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present an adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation protocol that achieves optimal measurement precision with spin-squeezed states under noises. Our protocol operates by maintaining measurements near the optimal point and employing Bayesian inference to sequentially perform phase estimation, enabling robust high-precision measurement. To account for realistic experimental conditions, we explicitly incorporate phase noises into the Bayesian likelihood function for more accurate estimation. Our protocol can be applied to various scenarios, such as quantum gravimeters and atomic clocks, achieving precision enhancement over conventional fitting methods under noises. Our approach offers superior precision and enhanced robustness against noises, making it highly promising for squeezing-enhanced quantum sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Bera, Igor V. Gornyi, Sumilan Banerjee, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aabhas Gulati, Ion Nechita, Sang-Jun Park</p>
            <p>This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliška Postavová, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignano, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</p>

This enhances the dynamic range of optical delay estimation by up to twenty times compared to the non-resolved estimates. We demonstrate this approach with independent photon sources and show the behaviour of finite frequency resolving detectors. This technique enables scan-free nanometre resolution depth sensing over a millimetre-scale range, with applications in biological and nanomaterial imaging.</p>

            <p>Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</p>

            <p>The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat-current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

However, there is much interest in ``non-trivial'' PoQ that actually rely on quantum hardness assumptions, as these are often a starting point for more sophisticated protocols such as classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC). We show several lower-bounds for the hardness required to achieve non-trivial PoQ, specifically showing that they likely require cryptographic hardness, with different types of cryptographic hardness being required for different variations of non-trivial PoQ. In particular, our results help explain the challenges in using lattices to build publicly verifiable PoQ and its various extensions such as CVQC.</p>

            <p>We construct a non-interactive zero-knowledge argument system for QMA with the following properties of interest. 1. Transparent setup. Our protocol only requires a uniformly random string (URS) setup. The only prior (publicly-verifiable) NIZK for QMA (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) requires an entire obfuscated program as the common reference string. 2. Extractability. Valid QMA witnesses can be extracted directly from our accepting proofs. That is, we obtain an argument of knowledge, which was previously only known in a secret parameters model (Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang, CRYPTO 2020). At the heart of our construction is a novel application of the coset state authentication scheme from (Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024) to the setting of QMA verification. Along the way, we establish new properties of the authentication scheme, and design a new type of ZX QMA verifier with ``strong completeness.'' The security of our construction rests on the heuristic use of a post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator. However, rather than rely on the full-fledged classical oracle model (i.e. ideal obfuscation), we isolate a particular game-based property of the obfuscator that suffices for our proof, which we dub the evasive composability heuristic. Going a step further, we show how to replace the heuristic use of an obfuscator with the heuristic use of a hash function (plus sub-exponentially secure functional encryption). We accomplish this by establishing security of the ideal obfuscation scheme of Jain, Lin, Luo, and Wichs (CRYPTO 2023) in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model, which can be heuristically instantiated with a hash function. This result is of independent interest, and allows us to translate several quantum-cryptographic results that were only known in the classical oracle model to results in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model.</p>

From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aritra Bal, Markus Klute, Benedikt Maier, Melik Oughton, Eric Pezone, Michael Spannowsky</p>
            <p>We introduce 1P1Q, a novel quantum data encoding scheme for high-energy physics (HEP), where each particle is assigned to an individual qubit, enabling direct representation of collision events without classical compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 1P1Q in quantum machine learning (QML) through two applications: a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection and a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) for supervised classification of top quark jets. Our results show that the QAE successfully distinguishes signal jets from background QCD jets, achieving superior performance compared to a classical autoencoder while utilizing significantly fewer trainable parameters. Similarly, the VQC achieves competitive classification performance, approaching state-of-the-art classical models despite its minimal computational complexity. Furthermore, we validate the QAE on real experimental data from the CMS detector, establishing the robustness of quantum algorithms in practical HEP applications. These results demonstrate that 1P1Q provides an effective and scalable quantum encoding strategy, offering new opportunities for applying quantum computing algorithms in collider data analysis.</p>

            <p>Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath, Simon B. Jäger</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Bao, Hao Geng, Yikun Jiang</p>
            <p>We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</p>

            <h2>Quantum effects in rotationally invariant spin glass models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshinori Hara, Yoshiyuki Kabashima</p>
            <p>This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Topological Mixed States: Phases of Matter from Axiomatic Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai-Hsuan Yang, Bowen Shi, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e., a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: mixed-state bootstrap program. From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges; importantly, these data are robust under relaxation of axioms. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical-demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability: weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic and Geometric Shifts in Wave Scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin Y. Bliokh, Zeyu Kuang, Stefan Rotter</p>
            <p>Since Berry's pioneering 1984 work, the separation of geometric and dynamic contributions in the {\it phase} of an evolving wave has become fundamental in physics, underpinning diverse phenomena in quantum mechanics, optics, and condensed matter. Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in their expectation values between the input and output wave states. We describe this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry and dynamics in wave scattering and can be applied to a broad range of physical systems.</p>

            <p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, with a sudden position-dependent change (a quench) in the effective dispersion relation, have been proposed by Rodríguez-Laguna et al as an analogue spacetime test of the Unruh effect. We provide new support for this analogue by analysing the entanglement of a scalar field in a (1 + 1)-dimensional continuum spacetime with a similar quench, and the harvesting of this entanglement by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We present numerical evidence that the concurrence and mutual information harvested by the detectors are qualitatively similar to those in Rindler spacetime, but they exhibit a small yet noticeable variation when the energy pulse created by the quench crosses the detectors. These findings provide further motivation to implement the experimental proposal of Rodríguez-Laguna et al.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Dorlis, Nick E. Mavromatos, Sarben Sarkar, Sotirios-Neilos Vlachos</p>
            <p>It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective. A brief discussion on current exclusion (for the first time) of very-long axion-cloud lifetimes, through comparison of our results with current LIGO data, as well as potential detection of such effects in future interferometers is also given</p>

            <p>By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</p>

            <p>Quantum electrodynamics in strong background fields provides an interesting class of problems for classical and quantum simulation. In this paper we formulate simulations of polarization (helicity) flip for a photon colliding with a high-intensity plane wave. Polarization flip is a one loop effect, which requires addressing new issues that do not arise in simulations of tree-level processes. Working in the momentum-space Fock basis, while convenient for the extraction of scattering amplitudes, requires tuning counterterms to cancel large cutoff effects. We compute analytic formulas for the counterterms at one loop. We then construct circuits for quantum simulations of the process, perform noiseless simulations on classical computers to assess discretization errors, and discuss resource estimates for future simulations on quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abijith Krishnan, Ajesh Kumar, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Baena-Jimenez, Angel Ballesteros, Ivan Gutierrez-Sagredo, Javier Relancio</p>
            <p>The Darboux III oscillator is an exactly solvable $N$-dimensional nonlinear oscillator defined on a radially symmetric space with non-constant negative curvature. Its one-dimensional version can be seen as a position dependent mass system whose mass function $\mu = (1 + \lambda x^2)$ depends on the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$, such that in the limit $\lambda \to 0$ the harmonic oscillator is recovered. In this paper, a detailed study of the entropic moments and of the Rényi and Tsallis information entropies for the quantum version of the one-dimensional Darboux III oscillator is presented. In particular, analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities in position space are obtained. Since the Fourier transform of the Darboux III wave functions does not admit a closed form expression, a numerical analysis of these quantities has been performed. Throughout the paper the interplay between the entropy parameter $\alpha$ and the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$ is analysed, and known results for the Shannon entropy of the Darboux III and for the Rényi and Tsallis entropies of the harmonic oscillator are recovered in the limits $\alpha \to 1$ and $\lambda \to 0$, respectively. Finally, motivated by the strong non-linear effects arising when large values of $\lambda$ and/or highly excited states are considered, an approximation to the probability density function valid in those regimes is presented. From it, an analytical approximation to the probability density in momentum space can be obtained, and some of the previously observed effects arising from the interplay between $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ can be explained.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning (QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget, qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on average over the state-of-the-art.</p>

            <h2>A Commuting Hamiltonian Framework for Quantum Time Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas R. Allgood</p>
            <p>We develop a mathematical framework for quantum time transfer based on commuting families of Hamiltonians and synchronization observables. The synchronization subspace is defined as the kernel of a difference operator between local clocks, and we show that this subspace is preserved exactly by a commutative $*$-subalgebra of Hamiltonians compatible with the clocks. Our first main result establishes \emph{perturbative stability}: for $\epsilon$-compatible dynamics, where the commutator with the synchronization operator is bounded in norm by $\epsilon$, we prove quantitative drift bounds showing that timing correlations degrade at most linearly in time with slope proportional to $\epsilon$. Our second main result provides a \emph{representation-theoretic classification}: in the presence of a finite group symmetry, the synchronization subspace coincides with the diagonal isotypic component in the tensor product decomposition, and synchronization preservation is characterized by the commutant algebra of the group action. These results identify synchronization as a structural invariant of operator algebras, connecting approximate commutation, kernel-preserving dynamics, and symmetry protection. Beyond quantum time transfer, the framework suggests categorical and resource-theoretic generalizations and contributes to the broader study of operator-algebraic invariants in multipartite quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet decoding errors via conventional algorithms result in limited accuracy (i.e., suppression of logical errors) and high overheads, both of which can be alleviated by inference-based decoders. To date, such machine-learning (ML) decoders lack two key properties crucial for practical fault tolerance: reliable uncertainty quantification and robust generalization to previously unseen codes. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{QuBA}, a Bayesian graph neural decoder that integrates attention to both dot-product and multi-head, enabling expressive error-pattern recognition alongside calibrated uncertainty estimates. Building on QuBA, we further develop \textbf{SAGU }\textbf{(Sequential Aggregate Generalization under Uncertainty)}, a multi-code training framework with enhanced cross-domain robustness enabling decoding beyond the training set. Experiments on bivariate bicycle (BB) codes and their coprime variants demonstrate that (i) both QuBA and SAGU consistently outperform the classical baseline belief propagation (BP), achieving a reduction of on average \emph{one order of magnitude} in logical error rate (LER), and up to \emph{two orders of magnitude} under confident-decision bounds on the coprime BB code $[[154, 6, 16]]$; (ii) QuBA also surpasses state-of-the-art neural decoders, providing an advantage of roughly \emph{one order of magnitude} (e.g., for the larger BB code $[[756, 16, \leq34]]$) even when considering conservative (safe) decision bounds; (iii) SAGU achieves decoding performance comparable to or even outperforming QuBA's domain-specific training approach.</p>

            <p>Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -> infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</p>

            <p>Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a variety of boson sampling overcoming the stable single-photon preparation difficulty of the later. However, like those in the original version, noises in GBS will also result in the deviation of output patterns and the reduction of classical simulation complexity. We extend the pattern recognition validation, together with the correlation approach as a comparison, on GBS using photon number resolving detectors with noises of both photon loss and distinguishability, to quantificationally evaluate noise levels. As for the classical simulation with noises to be used during validations, it is actually a simulation of mixed states where we employ an existing photon-pair strategy to realize polynomial speedup locally. Furthermore, we use an output-binning strategy to realize validation speedup. Our simulation indicates that the pattern recognition protocol is robust on noise evaluations of GBS even when noises are sufficiently low.</p>

            <p>The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</p>

Efficient extraction of entanglement can also inform our understanding of dynamical quantum processes such as measurement-induced phase transition and approximate unitary designs. We develop an efficient classical algorithm to compute the von Neumann entropy and entanglement spectrum for such states under the condition that they have low stabilizer nullity. The algorithm exploits the property of stabilizer codes to separate entanglement into two pieces: one generated by the common stabilizer group and the other from the logical state. The low-nullity constraint ensures both pieces can be computed efficiently. Our algorithm can be applied to study the entanglement in sparsely $T$-doped circuits with possible Pauli measurements as well as certain classes of states that have both high entanglement and magic. Combining with stabilizer learning subroutines, it also enables the efficient learning of von Neumann entropies for low-nullity states prepared on quantum devices.</p>

Does a typical such Hamiltonian already yield classically-intractable dynamics? We answer this question in the affirmative for the ensemble of geometrically-2-local Hamiltonians with Gaussian coefficients, evolved for constant time. This naturally leads to a quantum advantage scheme with clear prospects for experimental realization, necessitating only course-grained control. We give strong evidence of hardness for this physically-relevant ensemble. We develop the first worst-to-average-case reduction for approximating output probabilities of (time-independent) geometrically-2-local Hamiltonian evolutions. Our reduction proceeds by nonstandard means: while we also leverage polynomial interpolation, unlike previous works, we reduce directly to an evaluator for the exact distribution over Hamiltonians, from which we are trying to prove that sampling is hard. Previous works instead sampled from various perturbations of the true distribution, introducing additional constraints meant to keep the perturbation, measured in total variation distance, under control. We dispense with this step. Our reduction consists in a robust multivariate polynomial interpolation, reduced to sequential robust univariate interpolations via the symmetries of the Gaussian. We circumvent the fact that random Hamiltonians lack a hiding symmetry, a key property in previous proofs. We also contribute an algorithmic version of Berlekamp-Welch to deal with errored evaluations, solving an open problem from the RCS literature. We expect the machinery we develop to find use in average-case Hamiltonian complexity, filling in a gap in this literature which has thus far focussed on worst-case hardness results.</p>

            <h2>Blind quantum computing with different qudit resource state architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alena Romanova, Wolfgang Dür</p>
            <p>We discuss how blind quantum computing generalizes to multi-level quantum systems (qudits), which offers advantages compared to the qubit approach. Here, a quantum computing task is delegated to an untrusted server while simultaneously preventing the server from retrieving information about the computation it performs, the input, and the output, enabling secure cloud-based quantum computing. In the standard approach with qubits, measurement-based quantum computing is used: single-qubit measurements on cluster or brickwork states implement the computation, while random rotations of the resource qubits hide the computation from the server. We generalize finite-sized approximately universal gate sets to prime-power-dimensional qudits and show that qudit versions of the cluster and brickwork states enable a similar server-blind execution of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we compare the overheads of different resource state architectures and discuss which hiding strategies apply to alternative qudit resource states beyond graph states.</p>

            <h2>Classically Sampling Noisy Quantum Circuits in Quasi-Polynomial Time under Approximate Markovianity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan F. Zhang, Su-un Lee, Liang Jiang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in $n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits: (1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate. These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>Networks of sensors are a promising scheme to deliver the benefits of quantum technologies in coming years, offering enhanced precision and accuracy for distributed metrology through the use of large entangled states. Recent work has additionally explored the privacy of these schemes, meaning that local parameters can be kept secret while a joint function of these is estimated by the network. In this work, we use the abstract cryptography framework to relate the two proposed definitions of quasi-privacy, showing that both are composable, which enables the protocol to be securely included as a sub-routine to other schemes. We give an explicit example that estimating the mean of a set of parameters using GHZ states is composably fully secure.</p>

            <h2>Classical simulation of noisy random circuits from exponential decay of correlation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Su-un Lee, Soumik Ghosh, Changhun Oh, Kyungjoo Noh, Bill Fefferman, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>We study the classical simulability of noisy random quantum circuits under general noise models. While various classical algorithms for simulating noisy random circuits have been proposed, many of them rely on the anticoncentration property, which can fail when the circuit depth is small or under realistic noise models. We propose a new approach based on the exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), a measure of tripartite correlations. We prove that exponential CMI decay enables a classical algorithm to sample from noisy random circuits -- in polynomial time for one dimension and quasi-polynomial time for higher dimensions -- even when anticoncentration breaks down. To this end, we show that exponential CMI decay makes the circuit depth effectively shallow, and it enables efficient classical simulation for sampling. We further provide extensive numerical evidence that exponential CMI decay is a universal feature of noisy random circuits across a wide range of noise models. Our results establish CMI decay, rather than anticoncentration, as the fundamental criterion for classical simulability, and delineate the boundary of quantum advantage in noisy devices.</p>

            <p>In quantum many-body systems with kinetically constrained dynamics, the Hilbert space can split into exponentially many disconnected subsectors, a phenomenon known as Hilbert-space fragmentation. We study the interplay of such fragmentation with symmetries, focusing on charge conserving systems with charge conjugation and translation symmetries as a concrete example. The non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented subsectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which can be highly entangled. This algebra also provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures of Hilbert-space fragmentation, such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Tuziemski, J. Pawłowski, P. Tarasiuk, Ł. Pawela, B. Gardas</p>
            <p>We (re)evaluate recent claims of quantum advantage in annealing- and gate-based algorithms, testing whether reported speedups survive rigorous end-to-end runtime definitions and comparison against strong classicalbaselines. Conventional analyses often omit substantial overhead (readout, transpilation, thermalization, etc.) yielding biased assessments. While excluding seemingly not important parts of the simulation may seem reasonable, on most current quantum hardware a clean separation between "pure compute" and "overhead" cannot be experimentally justified. This may distort "supremacy" results. In contrast, for most classical hardware total time $\approx$ compute $+$ a weakly varying constant leading to robust claims. We scrutinize two important milestones: (1) quantum annealing for approximate QUBO [this https URL], which uses a sensible time-to-$\epsilon$ metric but proxies runtime by the annealing time (non-measurable); (2) a restricted Simon's problem [this https URL] , whose advantageous scaling in oracle calls is undisputed; yet, as we demonstrate, estimated runtime of the quantum experiment is $\sim 100 \times$ slower than a tuned classical baseline. Finally, we show that recently claimed "runtime advantage" of the BF-DCQO hybrid algorithm (arXiv:2505.08663) does not withstand rigorous benchmarking. Therefore, we conclude that runtime-based supremacy remains elusive on NISQ hardware, and credible claims require a careful time accounting with a proper reference selections, and an adequate metric.</p>

            <h2>Generalised quantum Sanov theorem revisited</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>Given two families of quantum states $A$ and $B$, called the null and the alternative hypotheses, quantum hypothesis testing is the task of determining whether an unknown quantum state belongs to $A$ or $B$. Mistaking $A$ for $B$ is a type I error, and vice versa for the type II error. In quantum Shannon theory, a fundamental role is played by the Stein exponent, i.e. the asymptotic rate of decay of the type II error probability for a given threshold on the type I error probability. Stein exponents have been thoroughly investigated -- and, sometimes, calculated. However, most currently available solutions apply to settings where the hypotheses simple (i.e. composed of a single state), or else the families $A$ and $B$ need to satisfy stringent constraints that exclude physically important sets of states, such as separable states or stabiliser states. In this work, we establish a general formula for the Stein exponent where both hypotheses are allowed to be composite: the alternative hypothesis $B$ is assumed to be either composite i.i.d. or arbitrarily varying, with components taken from a known base set, while the null hypothesis $A$ is fully general, and required to satisfy only weak compatibility assumptions that are met in most physically relevant cases -- for instance, by the sets of separable or stabiliser states. Our result extends and subsumes the findings of [BBH, CMP 385:55, 2021] (that we also simplify), as well as the 'generalised quantum Sanov theorem' of [LBR, arXiv:2408.07067]. The proof relies on a careful quantum-to-classical reduction via measurements, followed by an application of the results on classical Stein exponents obtained in [Lami, arXiv:today]. We also devise new purely quantum techniques to analyse the resulting asymptotic expressions.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of Noisy Geometrically Local Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Nelson, Joel Rajakumar, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>It has been known for almost 30 years that quantum circuits with interspersed depolarizing noise converge to the uniform distribution at $\omega(\log n)$ depth, where $n$ is the number of qubits, making them classically simulable. We show that under the realistic constraint of geometric locality, this bound is loose: these circuits become classically simulable at even shallower depths. Unlike prior work in this regime, we consider sampling from worst-case circuits and noise of any constant strength. First, we prove that the output distribution of any noisy geometrically local quantum circuit can be approximately sampled from in quasipolynomial time, when its depth exceeds a fixed $\Theta(\log n)$ critical threshold which depends on the noise strength. This scaling in $n$ was previously only obtained for noisy random quantum circuits (Aharonov et. al, STOC 2023). We further conjecture that our bound is still loose and that a $\Theta(1)$-depth threshold suffices for simulability due to a percolation effect. To support this, we provide analytical evidence together with a candidate efficient algorithm. Our results rely on new information-theoretic properties of the output states of noisy shallow quantum circuits, which may be of broad interest. On a fundamental level, we demonstrate that unitary quantum processes in constant dimensions are more fragile to noise than previously understood.</p>

While optimal strategies are known for sensing non-interacting Hamiltonians in quantum sensor networks, fundamental limits in the presence of uncontrolled interactions remain unclear. Here, we establish optimal bounds and protocols for estimating a linear combination of local parameters of Hamiltonians with arbitrary, unknown interactions. In the process, we more generally establish bounds for learning any linear combination of Hamiltonian coefficients for arbitrary, commuting terms. Our results unify and extend existing bounds for non-interacting qubits and multimode interferometers, providing a general framework for distributed sensing and Hamiltonian learning in realistic many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Borhan Ahmadi, Aravinth Balaji Ravichandran, Paweł Mazurek, Shabir Barzanjeh, Paweł Horodecki</p>
            <p>Quantum hardware increasingly relies on energy reserves that can later be converted into useful work; yet, most battery-like proposals demand coherent drives or engineered non-equilibrium resources, limiting practicality in noisy settings. We develop an autonomous charging paradigm in which an ensemble of identical two-level units, collectively coupled to a thermal environment, acquires work capacity without any external control. The common bath mediates interference between emission and absorption pathways, steering the many-body state away from passivity and into a steady regime with nonzero extractable work. The full charging dynamics and closed-form expressions are obtained for the steady-state, showing favorable scaling with the number of cells that approach the many-body optimum. We show that the mechanism is robust to local noise: under a convex mixture of collective and local dissipation, non-zero steady-state ergotropy persists, exhibits counterintuitive finite-temperature optima, and remains operative when the collective channel is comparable to or stronger than the local one. We show that environmental fluctuations can be harnessed to realize drive-free, scalable quantum batteries compatible with circuit- and cavity-QED platforms. Used as local work buffers, such batteries could potentially enable rapid ancilla reset, bias dissipative stabilizer pumps, and reduce syndrome-extraction overhead in fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Fourier Spectrum of Noisy Quantum Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uma Girish</p>
            <p>Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise. Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$ algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$, $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>We introduce the novel concept of mereological quantum phase transition (m-QPTs). Our framework is based on a variational family of operator algebras defining generalized tensor product structures (g-TPS), a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian, and a quantum scrambling functional. By minimizing the scrambling functional, one selects a g-TPS, enabling a pullback of the natural information-geometric metric on the g-TPS manifold to the parameter space. The singularities of this induced metric -- so-called algebra susceptibility -- in the thermodynamic limit characterize the m-QPTs. We illustrate this framework through analytical examples involving quantum coherence and operator entanglement. Moreover, spin-chains numerical simulations show susceptibility sharp responses at an integrability point and strong growth across disorder-induced localization, suggesting critical reorganizations of emergent subsystem structure aligned with those transitions.</p>

            <p>Filtering is commonly used in quantum optics to reject noise photons, and also to enable interference between independent photons. However, filtering the joint spectrum of photon pairs can reduce the inherent coincidence probability or loss-independent heralding efficiency. Here, we investigate filtering for multiphoton applications based on entanglement and interference (e.g., quantum teleportation). We multiplex C-band entangled photons and C-band classical communications into the same long-distance fibers, which enables scalable low-loss quantum networking but requires filtering of spontaneous Raman scattering noise from classical light. Using tunable-bandwidth filters, low-jitter detectors, and polarization filters, we co-propagate time-bin-entangled photons at wavelengths compatible with erbium-ion quantum memories (1536.5 nm) and 10-Gbps C-band classical data over 25 km/25 km of standard fiber. Narrow filtering enables mW-level C-band power, which exceeds comparable studies by roughly an order of magnitude and could feasibly support Tbps classical rates. We evaluate how performance depends on pump and filter bandwidths, multipair emission, filter shapes, loss, phase matching, and how quantum information is measured. We find a trade-off between improving noise impact and single-mode purity and discuss mitigation methods toward optimal multiphoton applications. Importantly, these results apply to noise in free space and in quantum devices (sources, frequency converters, switches, detectors, etc.) and provide insight on filter-induced degradation of single-photon purity and rates even in noise-free environments.</p>

We present a systematic, reproducible benchmark comparing quantum and classical machine learning models for BDE prediction using a chemically curated feature set encompassing atomic properties (atomic numbers, hybridization), bond characteristics (bond order, type), and local environmental descriptors. Our quantum framework, implemented in Qiskit Aer on six qubits, employs ZZFeatureMap encodings with variational ansatz (RealAmplitudes) across multiple architectures Variational Quantum Regressors (VQR), Quantum Support Vector Regressors (QSVR), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), and Quantum Random Forests (QRF). These are rigorously benchmarked against strong classical baselines, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Comprehensive evaluation spanning absolute and relative error metrics, threshold accuracies, and error distributions shows that top-performing quantum models (QCNN, QRF) match the predictive accuracy and robustness of classical ensembles and deep networks, particularly within the chemically prevalent mid-range BDE regime. These findings establish a transparent baseline for quantum-enhanced molecular property prediction and outline a practical foundation for advancing quantum computational chemistry toward near chemical accuracy.</p>

            <p>Recent research on excitonic insulator has progressed mainly based on narrow bandgap semiconductor or semimetal. Herein, we realize excitonic insulator based on two-dimensional (2D) wide band gap diamond with transition temperature as high as 220K. The resistance rises dramatically by more than three orders, which can be explained by the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons. While cooling down below transition temperature, the wavelength of the bound excitons caused by boron and nitrogen centers becomes highly overlapped, leading to BEC process. Furthermore, the variable range hopping mechanism is used to simulate the resistance as a function of temperature, which reveals the formation of excitonic insulator. When temperature drops down further, a sudden drop of resistance over three orders was observed around 60K, possibly due to the formation of non-equilibrium excitonic superfluid resulting from highly overlap of wavelength of the large density bound excitons at lower temperature. This study provides evidences for excitonic insulator and possible superfluid phase based on wide bandgap semiconductor.</p>

As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.</p>

            <p>Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) defines a duality that pairs decoding problems with optimization problems. The original work on DQI considered Reed-Solomon decoding, whose dual optimization problem, called Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a finite field. Here, we consider a class of algebraic geometry codes called Hermitian codes, which achieve block length $q^3$ using alphabet $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ compared to Reed-Solomon's limitation to block length $q$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, requiring approximately one-third fewer qubits per field element for quantum implementations. We show that the dual optimization problem, which we call Hermitian Optimal Polynomial Intersection (HOPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a Hermitian curve, and because the dual to a Hermitian code is another Hermitian code, the HOPI problem can also be viewed as approximate list recovery for Hermitian codes. By comparing to Prange's algorithm, simulated annealing, and algebraic list recovery algorithms, we find a large parameter regime in which DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation than these classical algorithms, suggesting that the apparent quantum speedup offered by DQI extends beyond Reed-Solomon codes to a broader class of polynomial regression problems on algebraic varieties.</p>

On one aspect, introducing the technique of recycling eliminates the shortcoming of data discarding in postselection, thus maintains similar noise level of conventional measurement (without postselection). On the other aspect, performing intentional postselection within the recycling framework, which was originally proposed in the context of gravitational wave detection, can amplify the signal. Thus, the measurement signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced.</p>

            <p>We investigate layer codes, a family of three-dimensional stabilizer codes that can achieve optimal scaling of code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier, as candidates for self-correcting quantum memories. First, we introduce two decoding algorithms for layer codes with provable guarantees for local stochastic and adversarial noise, respectively. We then prove that layer codes constitute partially self-correcting quantum memories which outperform previously analyzed models such as the cubic code and the welded solid code. Notably, we argue that partial self-correction without the requirement of efficient decoding is more common than expected, as it arises solely from a diverging energy barrier. This draws a sharp distinction between partially self-correcting systems and partially self-correcting memories. Another novel aspect of our work is an analysis of layer codes constructed from random Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes. We show that these random layer codes have optimal scaling (up to logarithmic corrections) of code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier. Finally, we present numerical studies of their memory times and report behavior consistent with partial self-correction.</p>

We examine two spin problems, one with random all-to-all couplings inspired by neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae, and the standard Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian on a $4 \times 3$ lattice. The neutrino Hamiltonian has the total spin $J$ and third component $J_{\rm{z}}$ as its only symmetries. The Heisenberg model has these symmetries plus translational invariance and reflection symmetry. We demonstrate that the convergence of variational methods is dramatically improved by keeping all symmetries. In both cases a nearly exact solution can be obtained in cases where standard unconstrained variational algorithms fail. Since variational algorithms can use standard Trotter steps as part of the optimization, allowing additional correlations that obey all the symmetries of the Hamiltonian will speed convergence of variational algorithms. This will lead to faster convergence than standard projection algorithms.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme to generate holonomies using the Quantum Zeno effect, enabling logical unitary operations on quantum stabilizer codes purely through measurements. The quantum error-correcting code space is adiabatically rotated by measuring a succession of rotated stabilizer generators. When the rotation is sufficiently slow, the state remains confined to the instantaneous code space by the Zeno effect; otherwise, measurement-induced jumps can occur into a rotated orthogonal subspace. If the rotation completes a closed loop, the code state is transformed by a holonomy: a logical unitary transformation. We analytically derive the sequence of rotated stabilizer generators that produce a desired holonomy, and find the total time required to implement this procedure with a given success probability. If a measurement moves the state to the orthogonal subspace, we present a method to alter the path of the rotated observables to return the state either to the original code or the original error space with the desired holonomy; in the latter case, the holonomy is emulated. Finally, we establish conditions on the code and the measured observables that preserve the correctability of a given error set. When a code fails to meet the error-correcting conditions, our protocol remains applicable by augmenting the code with at most two ancilla qubits.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Global Entanglement-Distillation Policies in Quantum Repeater Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iftach Yakar, Michael Ben-Or</p>
            <p>Quantum repeaters are essential for achieving long-distance quantum communication due to photon loss, which grows exponentially with the channel distance. Current quantum repeater generations use entanglement distillation protocols, where the decision of when to perform distillation depends on either local or global knowledge. Recent approaches for quantum repeaters, such as Mantri et al. (arXiv:2409.06152), consider using deterministic local decision policies for entanglement distillation. We ask whether global deterministic policies outperform local ones in terms of communication rate. We simulate equidistant repeater chains, assisted by two-way classical communication, and compare local and global policies for distillation decisions, spanning large distances and varying network and hardware parameters. Our findings show that global deterministic policies consistently outperform these local ones, and in some cases, determine whether secret communication is possible. For large repeater chains ($N>512$), global policies improve SKR by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that local distillation decisions in quantum repeater chains may not be optimal, and may inform future protocol design.</p>

            <h2>Fast-forwardable Lindbladians imply quantum phase estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong-Xia Shang, Naixu Guo, Patrick Rebentrost, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Tongyang Li, Qi Zhao</p>
            <p>Quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Lindbladian dynamics are both foundational in quantum information science and central to quantum algorithm design. In this work, we bridge these two concepts: certain simple Lindbladian processes can be adapted to perform QPE-type tasks. However, unlike QPE, which achieves Heisenberg-limit scaling, these Lindbladian evolutions are restricted to standard quantum limit complexity. This indicates that, different from Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$ within an error $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost, whose mechanism is fundamentally different from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of dissipative dynamics. We also adopt our fast-forwarding algorithm for efficient Gibbs state preparation and demonstrate the counter-intuitive implication: the allowance of a quadratically accelerated decoherence effect under arbitrary Pauli noise.</p>

            <h2>Constant-Overhead Addressable Gates via Single-Shot Code Switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Golowich, Kathleen Chang, Guanyu Zhu</p>
            <p>It is a major challenge to perform addressable and parallel logical operations on constant-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes. Indeed, the overhead of targeting specific logical qubits represents a crucial bottleneck in many quantum fault-tolerance schemes. We introduce fault-tolerant protocols for performing various addressable as well as parallel logical operations with constant space-time overhead, on a family of constant-rate and polynomial-distance qLDPC codes. Specifically, we construct gadgets for a large class of permutations of logical qubits. We apply these logical permutations to construct gadgets for applying a targeted Hadamard (or $CNOT$) gate on any chosen logical qubit (pair). We also construct gadgets for preparing logical code states, and for applying Hadamard gates on all logical qubits in a codeblock. All of our gadgets use constant quantum space-time overhead along with polynomially bounded classical computation. Prior protocols for such operations required larger overhead, or else relied on codes with certain symmetries that lack known asymptotic constructions. Our codes are given by tensor products of classical codes constructed from lossless expander graphs. Our core technical contribution is a constant-overhead code-switching procedure between 2- and 3-dimensional product codes, which generalizes Bombin's dimensional jump (arXiv:1412.5079). We prove that all of our gadgets exhibit a constant threshold under locally stochastic noise. Along the way, we develop a small-set flip decoder for high-dimensional product codes from lossless expanders. Our techniques yield additional interesting consequences, such as single-shot state preparation of 2-dimensional product codes with constant space-time overhead. We also propose a method for performing parallel non-Clifford gates by extending our techniques to codes supporting transversal application of such gates.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Guarantees of Variational Quantum Algorithm with Guiding States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tuyen Nguyen, Mária Kieferová</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are prominent candidates for near-term quantum advantage but lack rigorous guarantees of convergence and generalization. By contrast, quantum phase estimation (QPE) provides provable performance under the guiding state assumption, where access to a state with non-trivial overlap with the ground state enables efficient energy estimation. In this work, we ask whether similar guarantees can be obtained for VQAs. We introduce a variational quantum algorithm with guiding states aiming towards predicting ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. We then develop a proof technique-the linearization trick-that maps the training dynamics of the algorithm to those of a kernel model. This connection yields the first theoretical guarantees on both convergence and generalization for the VQA under the guiding state assumption. Our analysis shows that guiding states accelerate convergence, suppress finite-size error terms, and ensure stability across system dimensions. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on 2D random Heisenberg models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Cheng, Ziyuan Wang, Ruixuan Deng, Jianxin Chen, Zhengfeng Ji</p>
            <p>Classical simulation of quantum circuits is a critical tool for validating quantum hardware and probing the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Existing state-of-the-art methods, notably tensor network approaches, have computational costs governed by the treewidth of the underlying circuit graph, making circuits with large treewidth intractable. This work rigorously analyzes FeynmanDD, a decision diagram-based simulation method proposed in CAV 2025 by a subset of the authors, and shows that the size of the multi-terminal decision diagram used in FeynmanDD is exponential in the linear rank-width of the circuit graph. As linear rank-width can be substantially smaller than treewidth and is at most larger than the treewidth by a logarithmic factor, our analysis demonstrates that FeynmanDD outperforms all tensor network-based methods for certain circuit families. We also show that the method remains efficient if we use the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm to expand arbitrary single-qubit gates to sequences of Hadamard and T gates, essentially removing the gate-set restriction posed by the method.</p>

            <p>Understanding the entanglement structure of local Hamiltonian ground spaces is a physically motivated problem, with applications ranging from tensor network design to quantum error-correcting codes. To this end, we study the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).</p>

            <h2>Near-Asymptotically-Good Quantum Codes with Transversal CCZ Gates and Sublinear-Weight Parity-Checks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Golowich, Venkatesan Guruswami</p>
            <p>It is a major challenge to construct good quantum codes supporting fault-tolerant (e.g. transversal) non-Clifford gates with low-weight parity-check measurements. In this paper, we construct the first known quantum codes with linear dimension and distance supporting transversal non-Clifford gates that have sublinear locality (i.e. parity-check weight). Specifically, we construct codes with transversal $CCZ$ gates that have dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ denotes the block length. We furthermore design an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes. The alphabet size of these codes is $q=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$, but it can be reduced to a constant (e.g. $q=2$) while incurring a polylogarithmic loss in other parameters. We also show how to decrease the locality to $O(N^{1/3})$, albeit with a larger alphabet size and slightly lower distance. We construct these codes as products of classical codes with appropriate algebraic structure. While our quantum codes are subsystem codes with non-commuting gauge operators, we show they nevertheless permit error correction from noisy syndrome measurements. As byproducts, we prove multiple technical results of independent interest. In particular, our efficient decoder can be viewed as a new multivariate generalization of Prony's method for reconstructing a function from partial access to its Fourier transform. Meanwhile, our distance analysis involves new connections to the classical study of maximally recoverable codes. Our results on product codes also resolve a conjecture of Bravyi & Hastings (2014) in the large-alphabet regime, by providing a new construction of quantum codes with dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $N^\epsilon$ for arbitrary $\epsilon>0$.</p>

Experimental results from simulators and quantum hardware provide insights into the behavior and performance of quantum computers, especially in handling large-scale computations for malware detection tasks. The work summarizes the practical experience with using quantum hardware via the Qiskit interfaces. We describe in detail the critical issues encountered, as well as the fixes that had to be developed and applied to the base code of the Qiskit Machine Learning library.

            <p>We present a systematic pathway for solving differential equations within the quantum linear systems framework by combining block encoding with Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The approach is demonstrated on a complex tridiagonal linear system and extended to problems in computational fluid dynamics: the heat equation with mixed boundary conditions and the nonlinear Burgers' equation. Our scaling analysis of the heat equation shows how discretization influences the minimum singular value and the polynomial degree required for QSVT, identifying circuit-depth overhead as a key bottleneck. For Burgers' equation, we illustrate how Carleman-linearized nonlinear dynamics can be efficiently block encoded and solved within the QSVT framework. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of current methods, underscoring the need for efficient estimation of minimum singular value, depth-reduction techniques, and benchmarks against classical reachability. This pathway lays a foundation for advancing quantum linear system methods toward large-scale applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Allcock, Joao F. Doriguello, Gábor Ivanyos, Miklos Santha</p>
            <p>Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d > 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$: 1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples; 2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples; 3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples; 4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states; 5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.</p>

            <p>We introduce the first randomized algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework for many quantum algorithms. Standard implementations of QSVT rely on block encodings of the Hamiltonian, which are costly to construct, requiring a logarithmic number of ancilla qubits, intricate multi-qubit control, and circuit depth scaling linearly with the number of Hamiltonian terms. In contrast, our algorithms use only a single ancilla qubit and entirely avoid block encodings. We develop two methods: (i) a direct randomization of QSVT, where block encodings are replaced by importance sampling, and (ii) an approach that integrates qDRIFT into the generalized quantum signal processing framework, with the dependence on precision exponentially improved through classical extrapolation. Both algorithms achieve gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, a hallmark of randomized methods, while incurring only quadratic dependence on the degree of the target polynomial. We identify natural parameter regimes where our methods outperform even standard QSVT, making them promising for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We also establish a fundamental lower bound showing that the quadratic dependence on the polynomial degree is optimal within this framework. We apply our framework to two fundamental tasks: solving quantum linear systems and estimating ground-state properties of Hamiltonians, obtaining polynomial advantages over prior randomized algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our ground-state property estimation algorithm on electronic structure Hamiltonians and the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. In both cases, our approach outperforms prior work by several orders of magnitude in circuit depth, establishing randomized QSVT as a practical and resource-efficient alternative for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a versatile tool to detect entangled states and characterize related properties of entanglement in quantum information theory. A witness $W$ corresponds to an observable satisfying $\mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0$ for all separable states $\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}$; entangled states are detected once the inequality is violated. Recently, mirrored EWs have been introduced by showing that there exist non-trivial upper bounds to EWs, \begin{eqnarray} u_W\geq \mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0. \nonumber \end{eqnarray} An upper bound to a witness $W$ signifies the existence of the other one $M$, called a mirrored EW, such that $W+M = u_W I \otimes I$. The framework of mirrored EWs shows that a single EW can be even more useful, as it can detect a larger set of entangled states by lower and upper bounds. In this work, we develop and investigate mirrored EWs for multipartite qubit states and also for high-dimensional systems, to find the efficiency and effectiveness of mirrored EWs in detecting entangled states. We provide mirrored EWs for $n$-partite GHZ states, graph states such as two-colorable states, and tripartite bound entangled states. We also show that optimal EWs can be reflected with each other. For bipartite systems, we present mirrored EWs for existing optimal EWs and also construct a mirrored pair of optimal EWs in dimension three. Finally, we generalize mirrored EWs such that a pair of EWs can be connected by another EW, i.e., $W+M =K$ is also an EW. Our results enhance the capability of EWs to detect a larger set of entangled states in multipartite and high-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

When this happens, observes measure the environment and infer the system to be in one of its pointer states. We study the emergence of objectivity whenever the Hamiltonian of the system and the interaction Hamiltonian between system and environment do not commute, a condition which is thought to be incompatible with the presence of pointer states. We show that, not only non-commuting evolutions allow for the emergence of objective states, but it is possible to give a more relaxed definition of pointer states, that is always well defined whenever there is redundancy of information, and coincides with the usual one for commuting evolutions.</p>

            <p>Local operations and classical communication (LOCC) is a foundational framework in quantum information from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. However, designing and optimizing LOCC protocols is intractable due to their complex structure. Determining achievable bounds and designing practically implementable LOCC protocols remain crucial challenges when the number of communication rounds is finite. In this work, we develop a framework to optimize fixed-round LOCC via Riemannian optimization on the product Stiefel manifold, which not only yields near-optimal objective function values but also produces fully implementable protocols. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework through key tasks in quantum information processing, such as entanglement distillation and state merging. Our results provide new insights into the achievable bounds for entanglement distillation and block entanglement state merging. We obtain improved distillation and state merging protocols, some of which match the upper bounds derived via positive partial transpose relaxations.

Our protocol achieves unconditional soundness and computational zero-knowledge, under standard assumptions in cryptography.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armando Bellante, Stefano Vanerio, Stefano Zanero</p>
            <p>We study quantum sparse recovery in non-orthogonal, overcomplete dictionaries: given coherent quantum access to a state and a dictionary of vectors, the goal is to reconstruct the state up to $\ell_2$ error using as few vectors as possible. We first show that the general recovery problem is NP-hard, ruling out efficient exact algorithms in full generality. To overcome this, we introduce Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QOMP), the first quantum analogue of the classical OMP greedy algorithm. QOMP combines quantum subroutines for inner product estimation, maximum finding, and block-encoded projections with an error-resetting design that avoids iteration-to-iteration error accumulation. Under standard mutual incoherence and well-conditioned sparsity assumptions, QOMP provably recovers the exact support of a $K$-sparse state in polynomial time. As an application, we give the first framework for sparse quantum tomography with non-orthogonal dictionaries in $\ell_2$ norm, achieving query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N}/\epsilon)$ in favorable regimes and reducing tomography to estimating only $K$ coefficients instead of $N$ amplitudes. In particular, for pure-state tomography with $m=O(N)$ dictionary vectors and sparsity $K=\widetilde{O}(1)$ on a well-conditioned subdictionary, this circumvents the $\widetilde{\Omega}(N/\epsilon)$ lower bound that holds in the dense, orthonormal-dictionary setting, without contradiction, by leveraging sparsity together with non-orthogonality. Beyond tomography, we analyze QOMP in the QRAM model, where it yields polynomial speedups over classical OMP implementations, and provide a quantum algorithm to estimate the mutual incoherence of a dictionary of $m$ vectors in $O(m/\epsilon)$ queries, improving over both deterministic and quantum-inspired classical methods.</p>

We identify two common sets of definitions for first-law quantities that are used to describe the thermodynamics of quantum systems coupled to thermal environments. Both are conceptually non-symmetric, treating one part of the bipartition (the "system") differently from the other (the "bath"). We analyze these in a setting where such roles are not easily assigned - two large (but finite) sets of thermal harmonic oscillators interacting with each other. We further compare them with a third set of definitions based on a local, conceptually symmetric open-system approach ("minimal dissipation") and discuss their quantitative and structural differences. In particular, we observe that all three sets of definitions differ substantially even when the two subsystems are weakly coupled and far detuned, and that the minimal dissipation approach features distinct work peaks that increase with the coupling strength.</p>

Supported by quantum signal processing principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks, with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes.

            <h2>Realistic Threat Models for Fiber and Free-Space Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyue Zuo, Masoud Ghalaii, Stefano Pirandola</p>
            <p>Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryu Hayakawa, Casper Gyurik, Mahtab Yaghubi Rad, Vedran Dunjko</p>
            <p>We show the existence of an MA-complete homology problem for a certain subclass of simplicial complexes. The problem is defined through a new concept of orientability of simplicial complexes that we call a "uniform orientable filtration", which is related to sign-problem freeness in homology. The containment in MA is achieved through the design of new, higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes associated with the filtration. For the MA-hardness, we design a new gadget with which we can reduce from an MA-hard stoquastic satisfiability problem. Therefore, our result provides the first natural MA-complete problem for higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes, combining the concepts of topology, persistent homology, and quantum computing.</p>

Despite a more than 100-fold reduction in confocal volume, we achieve highly efficient photon collection through single-mode optical fibers, including zero-phonon line spectroscopy, at both room and cryogenic temperatures. These results establish a standardized minimal NV-center-based platform and pave the way for construction of scalable quantum infrastructure.</p>

            <p>In the rapidly evolving field of quantum technology, the precise and detailed description of quantum components is not just a necessity but the foundation for advancing research, development, and applications. Optically accessible quantum memories are key building blocks for devices such as quantum repeaters and two-factor authentication. The memory we describe here is based on a tin-vacancy color center coupled to a highly efficient cavity. It leverages state-dependent reflection from the cavity and implements high-fidelity fractional single qubit gates via a train of optical $\pi/8$ pulses. We also describe its operation under microwave control, further extending our analysis. Our primary contribution in this work is the integration of this device model into a standardized software framework for quantum memory architectures.</p>

            <h2>A Duality Theorem for Classical-Quantum States with Applications to Complete Relational Program Logics</h2>

            <p>Duality theorems play a fundamental role in convex optimization. Recently, it was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs, respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al., POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).</p>

            <p>Nanophotonic light-matter interfaces hold great promise for quantum technologies. Enhancing local electromagnetic fields, they enable highly efficient detectors, can help realize optically connected processors, or serve as quantum repeaters. In-situ fiber-coupling at sub-Kelvin temperatures, as required for test and development of new devices, proves challenging as suitable cryogenic microscopes are not readily available. Here, we report on a robust and versatile confocal imaging system integrated in a dilution refrigerator, enabling high-resolution visualization of nanophotonic structures on a transparent diamond substrate. Our imaging system achieves a resolution of 1.1 {\mu}m and a field-of-view of 2.5 mm. The system requires no movable parts at cryogenic temperatures and features a large working distance, thereby allowing optical and microwave probe access, as well as direct anchoring of temperature sensitive samples to a cold finger, needed for applications with high thermal load. This system will facilitate the development of scalable, integrated quantum optics technology, as required for research on large scale quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Potential of multi-anomalies detection using quantum machine learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takao Tomono, Kazuya Tsujimura</p>
            <p>Maintenance of production equipment is critical in manufacturing. Typically, machine learning models are trained on sensor data closely attached to equipment. However, as the number of machines increases, computational cost grows rapidly. In practice, anomalies are often identified by human operators through auditory perception, relying heavily on experience and intuition. In vibration analysis, especially, AR model coefficients combined with one-class SVMs are used for detecting anomalies. In this work, we explore the effect of substituting the classical kernel in the one-class SVM with a quantum kernel. Two experimental setups were used. The first involved a miniature racing car track, where the car passes over a patch of hook-and-loop fastener to generate abnormal sounds, which are recorded using a microphone. The second involved an open-belt drive, where chopsticks are inserted at specific times to produce crushing sounds, simulating sudden anomalies. Our results show a clear advantage of quantum kernels over classical Gaussian (RBF) kernels. On the miniature car track dataset, the quantum kernel achieved an accuracy and F1-score of 0.82, compared to 0.64 and 0.39 respectively for the RBF kernel. For the crushing device, the quantum kernel achieved perfect accuracy and F1-score (1.00), while the RBF kernel reached only 0.64 accuracy and 0.43 F1-score. These findings suggest that quantum kernels enhance the classification accuracy for diverse types of abnormal sound patterns, including both periodic and impulsive anomalies.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-induced two-axis spin squeezing with decoherence reduction in hybrid spin-optomechanical system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Qiao, Zu-Jian Ying</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to implement Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in a hybrid cavity optomechanical-spin system. In our system, $N$ two-level systems are coupled via Tavis-Cummings interactions to a mechanical resonator (MR) in a standard optomechanical setup. Within the dispersive coupling regime, adiabatic elimination of the optical mode induces a squeezing effect on the MR, which, in the squeezed representation, effectively transforms the collective spin operators into a Bogoliubov form. Under large detuning conditions, the phonon mode mediates interactions among the Bogoliubov collective spins, thereby enabling a two-axis twisting squeezing protocol through appropriate parameter tuning. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that in the presence of dephasing and phonon dissipation, the maximum squeezing degree asymptotically converges to a constant as $N$ increases, which implies the metrological precision asymptotically approaches the standard quantum limit without parameter optimization. Nevertheless, in parameter optimization we extract a scaling relation of the optimal squeezing which surpasses existing schemes in the literature. Moreover, the optimization also leads to a considerable reduction of the preparation time for the optimal squeezing. Our work may provide insights into dissipation effects in spin squeezing and offer a potential route for high-precision quantum metrology in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Symmetry plays a crucial role in the design and analysis of quantum protocols. This result shows a canonical circuit decomposition of a $(G \times H)$-invariant quantum comb for compact groups $G$ and $H$ using the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan transforms, which naturally extends to the $G$-covariant quantum comb. By using this circuit decomposition, we propose a parametrized quantum comb with group symmetry, and derive the optimal quantum comb which transforms an unknown unitary operation $U \in \mathrm{SU}(d)$ to its inverse $U^\dagger$ or transpose $U^\top$. From numerics, we find a deterministic and exact unitary transposition protocol for $d=3$ with $7$ queries to $U$. This protocol improves upon the protocol shown in the previous work, which requires $13$ queries to $U$.</p>

            <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of quantum emulation. However, existing studies often struggle to achieve broad applicability, high performance, and efficient resource and memory utilization. To address these challenges, we provide HPQEA, a quantum emulator based on the state-vector emulation approach. HPQEA includes three main features: a high-performance computing core, an optimized controlled-NOT gate computation strategy, and effective utilization of high-bandwidth memory. Verification and evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error. It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution, supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources. Furthermore, it exceeds the Nvidia A100 in normalized gate speed for systems with up to 20 qubits. These results demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of HPQEA as a platform for emulating quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>A user, Alice, wants to get server Bob to implement a quantum computation for her. However, she wants to leave him blind to what she's doing. What are the minimal communication resources Alice must use in order to achieve information-theoretic security? In this paper, we consider a single step of the protocol, where Alice conveys to Bob whether or not he should implement a specific gate. We use an entropy-bounding technique to quantify the minimum number of qubits that Alice must send so that Bob cannot learn anything about the gate being implemented. We provide a protocol that saturates this bound. In this optimal protocol, the states that Alice sends may be entangled. For Clifford gates, we prove that it is sufficient for Alice to send separable states.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Quality Bound on Optical Quantum Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Rippchen, Ludovico Lami, Gerardo Adesso, Mario Berta</p>
            <p>Sending quantum information reliably over long distances is a central challenge in quantum technology in general, and in quantum optics in particular, since most quantum communication relies on optical fibres or free-space links. Here, we address this problem by shifting the focus from the quantity of information sent to the quality of the transmission, i.e. the rate of decay of the transmission error with respect to the number of channel uses. For the general class of teleportation-simulable channels, which includes all channels arising in quantum optical communication, we prove that the single-letter reverse relative entropy of entanglement of the Choi state upper bounds the error exponent of two-way assisted quantum communication - paralleling the celebrated capacity bound of [Pirandola et al., Nat. Comm. (2017)] in terms of the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Remarkably, for Gaussian channels our bound can be computed efficiently through a convex program with simple constraints involving only finite-dimensional covariance matrices. As a prototypical application, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for several one-mode Gaussian channels that are fundamental to optical communication. Extending recent work [Lami et al., arXiv:2408.07067 (2024)] to infinite-dimensional systems, we further endow the reverse relative entropy of entanglement with an exact operational interpretation in entanglement testing, and show that it characterises the rate of entanglement distillation under non-entangling operations. These findings offer a new perspective on entanglement as a resource and sharpen the theoretical benchmarks for future quantum optical networks.</p>

            <p>We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>A major challenge in quantum communication is addressing the negative effects of noise on channel capacity, especially for completely depolarizing channels, where information transmission is inherently impossible. The concept of indefinite causal order provides a promising solution by allowing control over the sequence in which channels are applied. We experimentally demonstrate the activation of quantum communication through completely depolarizing channels using a programmable silicon photonic quantum chip. By implementing configurations based on the superposition of cyclic orders, a form of indefinite causal order, we report the first experimental realization of genuine quantum information transmission across multiple concatenated completely depolarizing channels. Our results show that when four completely depolarizing channels are combined using the superposition of cyclic orders, the fidelity of the output state is $0.712 \pm 0.013$, significantly exceeding the classical threshold of 2/3. Our work establishes indefinite causal order as a powerful tool for overcoming noise-induced limitations in quantum communication, demonstrating its potential in high-noise environments and opening new possibilities for building robust quantum networks.</p>

            <p>The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated supercon- ducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.</p>

This is the strongest bound known for any family of quantum error correcting codes (QECs), and continues a line of work showing that approximate QECs can significantly outperform exact QECs [LNCY97, CGS05, BGG24].

            <p>In 2020, a landmark result by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen showed that MIP*, the class of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier interacting with multiple computationally unbounded provers sharing entanglement in the tensor product model, is equal to RE. We show that the class MIPco, a complexity class defined similarly to MIP* except with provers sharing the commuting operator model of entanglement, is equal to the class coRE. This shows that giving the provers two different models of entanglement leads to two completely different computational powers for interactive proof systems. Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of MIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that the same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property in the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the compression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous framework used by Mousavi et al. [STOC 2022], as well as the improved Pauli basis test introduced by de la Salle [arXiv:2204.07084]. We introduce a new equivalence condition for RE/coRE-complete problems, which we call the weakly compressible condition. We show that both MIP* and MIPco satisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish that the uncomputability for MIP* and MIPco can be proved under a unified framework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this approach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP*=RE theorem, which does not rely on the preservation of the entanglement bound. In addition to non-local games, this new condition could also potentially be applicable to other decision problems.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of Clifford testing, which asks whether a black-box $n$-qubit unitary is a Clifford unitary or at least $\varepsilon$-far from every Clifford unitary. We give the first 4-query Clifford tester, which decides this problem with probability $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$. This contrasts with the minimum of 6 copies required for the closely-related task of stabilizer testing. We show that our tester is tolerant, by adapting techniques from tolerant stabilizer testing to our setting. In doing so, we settle in the positive a conjecture of Bu, Gu and Jaffe, by proving a polynomial inverse theorem for a non-commutative Gowers 3-uniformity norm. We also consider the restricted setting of single-copy access, where we give an $O(n)$-query Clifford tester that requires no auxiliary memory qubits or adaptivity. We complement this with a lower bound, proving that any such, potentially adaptive, single-copy algorithm needs at least $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ queries. To obtain our results, we leverage the structure of the commutant of the Clifford group, obtaining several technical statements that may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya Sriram, Vedika Khemani, Benedikt Placke</p>
            <p>Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junkai Zeng, Xiu-Hao Deng</p>
            <p>Noise is ubiquitous in quantum systems and is a major obstacle for the advancement of quantum information science. Noise-robust quantum control achieves high-fidelity operations by engineering the evolution path so that first-order noise contributions cancel at the final time. Such dynamical error correction typically incurs a time overhead beyond standard quantum speed limits. We derive general lower bounds on control complexity that quantify this overhead for quasi-static coherent noise under bounded control amplitude. For a single noise source, we prove a universal time lower bound for first-order robustness and give a constructive scheme that implements any target gate robustly in time 4T plus a constant time. For robustness against an entire noise space, we show dimension lower bounds on the number M of segments in any mixed-unitary schedule from two mechanism: (i) a coherent dimension bound when the error subspace contains an irreducible block isomorphic to su(q), and (ii) a projection dimension bound when the noise space contains the trace-zero span of orthogonal projectors. Under bounded speed, these bounds on number of segments imply time lower bounds. With only local controls robust against noise space defined on a graph, we obtain a graph-orthogonality time bound scales linear with graph chromatic number. We illustrate the bounds through examples. Collectively, these results establish quantitative limitations on the feasibility of first-order noise-resilient operations.</p>

            <p>Quantum learning from remotely accessed quantum compute and data must address two key challenges: verifying the correctness of data and ensuring the privacy of the learner's data-collection strategies and resulting conclusions. The covert (verifiable) learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC 2021) provides a framework for endowing classical learning algorithms with such guarantees. In this work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learning theory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remote data access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. We consider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii) target-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the unknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for making quantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms for learning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantum statistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learning from public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and for solving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and private classical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d. ancilla-free eavesdropper. The lattermost results in particular establish that the exponential separation between classical and quantum queries for Forrelation and Simon's problem survives under covertness constraints. Along the way, we design covert verifiable protocols for quantum data acquisition from public quantum queries which may be of independent interest. Overall, our models and corresponding algorithms demonstrate that quantum advantages are privately and verifiably achievable even with untrusted, remote data.</p>

We analyse the complexity of inference for networks under three quantum data access regimes. Without any assumptions, we establish a quadratic speedup over classical methods for shallow bilinear-style networks. With efficient quantum access to the weights, we obtain a quartic speedup over classical methods. With efficient quantum access to both the inputs and the network weights, we prove that a network with an $N$-dimensional vectorized input, $k$ residual block layers, and a final residual-linear-pooling layer can be implemented with an error of $\epsilon$ with $O(\text{polylog}(N/\epsilon)^k)$ inference cost.</p>

            <h2>Spin quantum computing, spin quantum cognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Betony Adams, Francesco Petruccione</p>
            <p>Over two decades ago, Bruce Kane proposed that spin-half phosphorus nuclei embedded in a spin-zero silicon substrate could serve as a viable platform for spin-based quantum computing. These nuclear spins exhibit remarkably long coherence times, making them ideal candidates for qubits. Despite this advantage, practical realisation of spin quantum computing remains a challenge. More recently, physicist Matthew Fisher proposed a hypothesis linking nuclear spin dynamics, specifically those of phosphorus nuclei within the spin-zero matrix of calcium phosphate molecules, to neural activation and, potentially, cognition. The theory has generated both interest and scepticism, with some fundamental questions remaining. We review this intersection of quantum computing and quantum biology by outlining the similarities between these models of quantum computing and quantum cognition. We then address some of the open questions and the lessons that might be learned in each context. In doing so, we highlight a promising bidirectional exchange: not only might quantum computing offer tools for understanding quantum biology, but biological models may also inspire novel strategies for quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We present a tensor-network-based method for simulating a weakly-measured quantum circuit. In particular, we use a Markov chain to efficiently sample measurements and contract the tensor network, propagating their effect forward along the spatial direction. Applications of our algorithm include validating quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications, where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.</p>

            <p>Prior work of Beverland et al. has shown that any exact Clifford+$T$ implementation of the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate must use at least $n$ $T$ gates. Here we show how to get away with exponentially fewer $T$ gates, at the cost of incurring a tiny $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error that can be neglected in most practical situations. More precisely, the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate can be implemented to within error $\epsilon$ in the diamond distance by a randomly chosen Clifford+$T$ circuit with at most $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ $T$ gates. We also give a matching $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$ lower bound that establishes optimality, and we show that any purely unitary implementation achieving even constant error must use $\Omega(n)$ $T$ gates. We also extend our sampling technique to implement other Boolean functions. Finally, we describe upper and lower bounds on the $T$-count of Boolean functions in terms of non-adaptive parity decision tree complexity and its randomized analogue.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Thomas, Ulysse Chabaud, Pierre-Emmanuel Emeriau</p>
            <p>Efficient learning of quantum state properties is both a fundamental and practical problem in quantum information theory. Classical shadows have emerged as an efficient method for estimating properties of unknown quantum states, with rigorous statistical guarantees, by performing randomized measurement on a few number of copies. With the advent of photonic technologies, formulating efficient learning algorithms for such platforms comes out as a natural problem. Here, we introduce a classical shadow protocol for learning photonic quantum states via randomized passive linear optical transformations and photon-number measurement. We show that this scheme is efficient for a large class of observables of interest. We experimentally demonstrate our findings on a twelve-mode photonic integrated quantum processing unit. Our protocol allows for scalable learning of a wide range of photonic state properties and paves the way to applying the already rich variety of applications of classical shadows to photonic platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Narayan S Iyer, Shraddha Sharma</p>
            <p>In the present article, we examine the relationship of negative conditional quantum Kaniadakis entropy ($\alpha-$CQKE) with the fully entangled fraction (FEF) which is a substantial yardstick for quantum information processing protocols including teleportation, and quantum steerability, executed over four vital quantum states with maximally mixed marginals, the 2-qubit Werner state, the 2-qubit Weyl state, the 2-qudit Werner state and the isotropic state. We initiate our analysis in 2$\otimes$2 systems where we derive implicit bounds on FEF when the $\alpha-$CQKE takes negative values, i.e. when $\alpha-$CQKE $\in$ $R^{-}$ for 2-qubit Werner state. Consequently, we derive the sufficient implicit bounds for a definitive claim on the non-usefulness of Werner state for quantum teleportation provided its visibility parameter succeeds to elude a critical region, the exception region 1, where the situation becomes inconclusive. Subsequently, we replicate the same for the 2-qubit Weyl state with some constraints augmented by an analogous exception region 2 and the correlation tensor matrix elements. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to d $\otimes$ d states, commencing our analysis with the Isotropic state. We derive implicit bounds on FEF of the Isotropic state and the 2-qudit Werner state resembling the ones in the 2$\otimes$2 analysis. Additionally, we utilize the convoluted relationship between the FEF and quantum steerability to formulate propositions linking negative $\alpha-$CQKE to the k-copy steerability of isotropic states for projective measurements, thereby reducing the intricacy of the study of k-copy steerability directly via FEF. In the appendix section of the article, we provide corroborative calculations and supplementary materials to the theorems presented in the main sections.</p>

            <p>We establish novel connections between magic in quantum circuits and communication complexity. In particular, we show that functions computable with low magic have low communication cost. Our first result shows that the $\mathsf{D}\|$ (deterministic simultaneous message passing) cost of a Boolean function $f$ is at most the number of single-qubit magic gates in a quantum circuit computing $f$ with any quantum advice state. If we allow mid-circuit measurements and adaptive circuits, we obtain an upper bound on the two-way communication complexity of $f$ in terms of the magic + measurement cost of the circuit for $f$. As an application, we obtain magic-count lower bounds of $\Omega(n)$ for the $n$-qubit generalized Toffoli gate as well as the $n$-qubit quantum multiplexer. Our second result gives a general method to transform $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous quantum messages with shared entanglement) into $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous classical messages with shared entanglement) which incurs only a polynomial blowup in the communication and entanglement complexity, provided the referee's action in the $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocol is implementable in constant $T$-depth. The resulting $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols satisfy strong privacy constraints and are $\mathsf{PSM}^*$ protocols (private simultaneous message passing with shared entanglement), where the referee learns almost nothing about the inputs other than the function value. As an application, we demonstrate $n$-bit partial Boolean functions whose $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ complexity is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and whose $\mathsf{R}$ (interactive randomized) complexity is $n^{\Omega(1)}$, establishing the first exponential separations between $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ and $\mathsf{R}$ for Boolean functions.</p>

We attribute this slow entanglement growth to the similarly slow growth of the participation entropy, which bounds the entanglement. Furthermore, the quantum circuit can be mapped to a classical spin model with real positive Boltzmann weights which involves local multi-spin interactions and displays glassy dynamics at finite temperature. We trace the origin of both the slow quantum dynamics and the classical glassiness to the presence of large, non-local symmetry operators. Our work establishes a novel connection between quantum entanglement dynamics and classical glassy behavior, offering a new geometric perspective on entanglement phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Analyzing the impact of noise is of fundamental importance to understand the advantages provided by quantum systems. While the classical simulability of noisy discrete-variable systems is increasingly well understood, noisy bosonic circuits are more challenging to simulate and analyze. Here, we address this gap by introducing the $\textit{displacement propagation}$ algorithm, a continuous-variable analogue of Pauli propagation for simulating noisy bosonic circuits. By exploring the interplay of noise and quantum resources, we identify several computational phase transitions, revealing regimes where even modest noise levels render bosonic circuits efficiently classically simulable. In particular, our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: computational resources usually associated with bosonic quantum advantage, namely non-Gaussianity and symplectic coherence, can make the system easier to classically simulate in presence of noise.</p>

            <p>Despite extensive study, our understanding of quantum Markov chains remains far less complete than that of their classical counterparts. [Temme'13] observed that the Davies Lindbladian, a well-studied model of quantum Markov dynamics, contains an embedded classical Markov generator, raising the natural question of how the convergence properties of the quantum and classical dynamics are related. While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the Davies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical generator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then the two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain techniques to the quantum setting. The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded in terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient. Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full Davies generator.</p>

            <p>We introduce transversal dimension jump, a code-switching protocol for lifted product (LP) quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes across different chain-complex dimensions, enabling universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with low overhead. The construction leverages the product structure of LP codes to implement one-way transversal CNOTs between a 3D code and its 2D component codes, enabling teleportation-based switching. Combined with constant-depth CCZ gates in 3D LP codes and low-overhead transversal Clifford gates in 2D LP codes, this yields universal, high-rate quantum logical computation with high thresholds and low space-time costs. Beyond asymptotic schemes, we identify explicit 3D-2D LP code pairs supporting cup-product CCZ gates, including bivariate tricycle-bicycle families such as the $[[81,3,5]]$-$[[54,2,6]]$ pair, where the 3D tricycle codes admit depth-2 CCZ, weight-6 stabilizers, and pseudo-thresholds $\gtrsim 0.4\%$. As a byproduct, we show that the 3D codes enable highly efficient magic-state preparation: a single round of stabilizer measurements followed by depth-2 CCZ and postselection produces states with error $<10^{-9}$ and success probability $\sim 35\%$. Our results establish a native integration of qLDPC codes with complementary transversal gates-covering nearly all practically relevant families known so far-and open a broad design space for scalable, low-overhead universal quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive end-to-end quantum algorithm for tensor problems, including tensor PCA and planted kXOR, that achieves potential superquadratic quantum speedups over classical methods. We build upon prior works by Hastings~(\textit{Quantum}, 2020) and Schmidhuber~\textit{et al.}~(\textit{Phys.~Rev.~X.}, 2025), we address key limitations by introducing a native qubit-based encoding for the Kikuchi method, enabling explicit quantum circuit constructions and non-asymptotic resource estimation. Our approach substantially reduces constant overheads through a novel guiding state preparation technique as well as circuit optimizations, reducing the threshold for a quantum advantage. We further extend the algorithmic framework to support recovery in sparse tensor PCA and tensor completion, and generalize detection to asymmetric tensors, demonstrating that the quantum advantage persists in these broader settings. Detailed resource estimates show that 900 logical qubits, $\sim 10^{15}$ gates and $\sim 10^{12}$ gate depth suffice for a problem that classically requires $\sim 10^{23}$ FLOPs. The gate count and depth for the same problem without the improvements presented in this paper would be at least $10^{19}$ and $10^{18}$ respectively. These advances position tensor problems as a candidate for quantum advantage whose resource requirements benefit significantly from algorithmic and compilation improvements; the magnitude of the improvements suggest that further enhancements are possible, which would make the algorithm viable for upcoming fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Preparing symmetry-adapted initial states is a principal bottleneck in first-quantized quantum simulation. We present a universal approach that efficiently maps any polynomial-size superposition of occupation-number configurations to the first-quantized representation on a digital quantum computer. The method exploits the Jordan--Schwinger Lie algebra homomorphism, which identifies number-conserving second-quantized operators with their first-quantized action and induces an equivariant bijection between Fock occupations and $\mathfrak{su}(d)$ weight states within the Schur--Weyl decomposition. Operationally, we prepare an encoded superposition of Schur labels via a block-encoded linear combination of unitaries and then apply the inverse quantum Schur transform. The algorithm runs in time $\text{poly}(L, N, d, \log \epsilon^{-1})$ for $L$ configurations of $N$ particles over $d$ modes to accuracy $\epsilon$, and applies universally to fermions, bosons, and Green's paraparticles in arbitrary single-particle bases. Resource estimates indicate practicality within leading first-quantized pipelines; statistics-aware or faster quantum Schur transforms promise further reductions.</p>

            <p>Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space, evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work, we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.</p>

            <p>The presence of energy barriers in the state space of a physical system can lead to exponentially slow convergence for sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the classical setting, replica exchange (or parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a similar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time of quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue of the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of two replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of Hamiltonians with local energy barriers. Our main result provides a rigorous lower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which leads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier height. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples, including the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and defected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature. Our work provides a rigorous acceleration mechanism for quantum Gibbs preparation.</p>

            <p>Unambiguous measurements play an important role in quantum information, with applications ranging from quantum key distribution to quantum state reconstruction. Recently, such measurements have also been used in quantum algorithms based on Regev's reduction. The key problem for these algorithms is the S-LWE problem for lattice problems, or the Quantum Decoding Problem for code problems. A key idea for addressing this problem is to use unambiguous measurements to recover $k$ coordinates of a code (or lattice) element $x$ from a quantum state $|\psi_x\rangle$, which corresponds to a noisy word $x$ with errors in quantum superposition. However, a general theoretical framework to analyze this approach has been lacking. In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous measurements. Given a family of states $\{\,|\psi_x\rangle\,\}_{x\in\{0,1\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist measurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about $x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally arises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal number of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear program, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results showing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach of arXiv:2310.20651. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the Quantum Decoding Problem.</p>

            <p>Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of continuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical systems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a fundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we efficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the perspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory, characterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of the number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of copies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then extend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies suffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are far. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states necessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a fundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on rotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently introduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds.</p>

            <p>Amortization systems are used widely in economy to generate payment schedules to repaid an initial debt with its interest. We present a generalization of these amortization systems by introducing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics based on vector spaces. Operators are defined for debt, amortization, interest and periodic payment and their mean values are computed in different orthonormal basis. The vector space of the amortization system will have dimension M, where M is the loan maturity and the vectors will have a SO(M) symmetry, yielding the possibility of rotating the basis of the vector space while preserving the distance among vectors. The results obtained are useful to add degrees of freedom to the usual amortization systems without affecting the interest profits of the lender while also benefitting the borrower who is able to alter the payment schedules. Furthermore, using the tensor product of algebras, we introduce loans entanglement in which two borrowers can correlate the payment schedules without altering the total repaid.</p>

            <p>Motivated by Heisenberg's observable-only stance, we replace latent "information" (filtrations, hidden diffusions, state variables) with observable transitions between price states. On a discrete price lattice with a Hilbert-space representation, shift operators and the spectral calculus of the price define observable frequency operators and a translation-invariant convolution generator. Combined with jump operators that encode transition intensities, this yields a completely positive, translation-covariant Lindblad semigroup. Under the risk-neutral condition the framework leads to a nonlocal pricing equation that is diagonal in Fourier space; in the small-mesh diffusive limit its generator converges to the classical Black-Scholes-Merton operator. We do not propose another parametric model. We propose a foundation for model construction that is observable, first-principles, and mathematically natural. Noncommutativity emerges from the observable shift algebra rather than being postulated. The jump-intensity ledger determines tail behavior and short-maturity smiles and implies testable links between extreme-event probabilities and implied-volatility wings. Future directions: (i) multi-asset systems on higher-dimensional lattices with vector shifts and block kernels; (ii) state- or flow-dependent kernels as "financial interactions" leading to nonlinear master equations while preserving linear risk-neutral pricing; (iii) empirical tests of the predicted scaling relations between jump intensities and market extremes.</p>

            <p>We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>A doubly composite Chernoff-Stein lemma and its applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Lami</p>
            <p>Given a sequence of random variables $X^n=X_1,\ldots, X_n$, discriminating between two hypotheses on the underlying probability distribution is a key task in statistics and information theory. Of interest here is the Stein exponent, i.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a vanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and i.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative entropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of this result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings where the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but rather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components taken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that applies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely correlated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both hypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either hypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved using a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2025]. In this refined form, blurring is applied symbol by symbol, which makes it both stronger and applicable also in the absence of permutational symmetry. The second part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter formula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad families of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying alternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction' statement that covers a wide family of convex constraints. Applications to quantum hypothesis testing are explored in a related paper [Lami, arXiv:today].</p>

Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby universe.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruizhi Liu, Jinmin Yi, Liujun Zou</p>
            <p>Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices, which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state, as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions, the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general theorems in various concrete examples.</p>

            <h2>Fisher Information, Training and Bias in Fourier Regression Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Pastori, Veronika Eyring, Mierk Schwabe</p>
            <p>Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.</p>

            <h2>Noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward McCann</p>
            <p>By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.</p>

            <h2>Towards Nonperturbative Solution of Quantum Dynamics : A Hamiltonian Mean Field Approximation Scheme with Perturbation Theory for Arbitray Strength of Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. P. Mahapatra</p>
            <p>We introduce a non perturbative general approximation scheme (NGAS) that can handle interactions of any strength in quantum theory. This approach starts with an input Hamiltonian that can be solved exactly. The interaction effects are then built into this Hamiltonian through nonlinear feedback enforced by self consistency conditions. While the method itself is nonperturbative it can be systematically improved using a new perturbation method called 'mean field perturbation theory' which does not involve power series expansion in any small parameter. We put this scheme to the test on one dimensional anharmonic interactions using the harmonic approximation. The results are consistently accurate across various cases including quartic, sextic, and octic anharmonic oscillators, as well as the quartic double well oscillator (QDWO) even when the coupling strength varies widely. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated when we swap the input Hamiltonian for that of an infinite square well and still achieve comparable accuracy. When applied to the {\lambda}{\phi}4 quantum field theory this approach aligns with the Gaussian effective potential method under the harmonic approximation. Beyond that it reveals the condensate structure of the effective vacuum and highlights the instability of the perturbative ground state. Notably, our ground-state energy results for the QDWO stand in stark contrast to those from standard perturbation theory where Borel summation fails regardless of coupling strength.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahana Chakraborty, Michele Pini, Martina S. Zündel, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</p>

Using two new ideas, each of which reduces the exponent separately, our new bound on the word length is $O(n^{1.44042\ldots+\delta})$. Our result holds more generally for any finite set that densely generates any connected, semisimple real Lie group, with an extra length term in the noncompact case to reach group elements far away from the identity.</p>

            <p>We show the relationship between the Fourier coefficients and the barren plateau problem emerging in parameterized quantum circuits. In particular, the sum of squares of the Fourier coefficients is exponentially restricted concerning the qubits under the barren plateau condition. Throughout theory and numerical experiments, we introduce that this property leads to the vanishing of a probability and an expectation formed by parameterized quantum circuits. The traditional barren plateau problem requires the variance of gradient, whereas our idea does not explicitly need a statistic. Therefore, it is not required to specify the kind of initial probability distribution.</p>

            <p>Integrated photonics has revolutionized fields such as telecommunications, quantum optics, and metrology by enabling compact, scalable circuits through highly confined optical modes. Within the field of quantum acoustics, phonons have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering advantages such as lower energy, smaller mode volume, and low propagation speeds, which make them ideal for interfacing diverse quantum systems. Developing integrated phononic circuits is thus essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum acoustics and advancing technologies such as quantum computing and hybrid systems. In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device. This work represents a foundational advance toward scalable, integrated phononic platforms for both classical and quantum applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Mehta, Connor Paddock, Lewis Wooltorton</p>
            <p>This work investigates the family of extended tilted-CHSH inequalities in the single-prover cryptographic compiled setting. In particular, we show that a quantum polynomial-time prover can violate these Bell inequalities by at most negligibly more than the violation achieved by two non-communicating quantum provers. To obtain this result, we extend a sum-of-squares technique to monomials with arbitrarily high degree in the Bob operators and degree at most one in the Alice operators. We also introduce a notion of partial self-testing for the compiled setting, which resembles a weaker form of self-testing in the bipartite setting. As opposed to certifying the full model, partial self-testing attempts to certify the reduced states and measurements on separate subsystems. In the compiled setting, this is akin to the states after the first round of interaction and measurements made on that state. Lastly, we show that the extended tilted-CHSH inequalities satisfy this notion of a compiled self-test.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paula Belzig, Li Gao, Graeme Smith, Peixue Wu</p>
            <p>The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boxi Li, F. A. Cárdenas-López, Adrian Lupascu, Felix Motzoi</p>
            <p>Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.</p>

While mostly undesired in gate-based quantum computing, dissipation due to material imperfections or coupling to the environment acts as a natural mechanism intrinsically providing fading memory to reservoir computers based on dynamical open quantum systems. In this work, we unravel a connection between the physical metric of optical absorption and the performance of quantum reservoir computers in terms of their short-term memory capacity. We establish this link by considering a coherent input encoding in conjunction with tunable qubit decay, giving precise control over the fading memory in the quantum reservoir computer. Our analysis enables us to identify a sweet-spot regime for the dissipation strength at which memory performance is maximized.</p>

            <p>When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.</p>

We study the ensuing crossover to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the crossover.</p>

            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enhancing metrological sensitivity, boosting communication security, and enabling parallel processing in computation. Its practical potential, however, remains constrained by the inherent single-mode operation of homodyne detection, necessitating post-processing for multimode characterization. Here, we overcome this long-standing challenge by employing multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA), enabling loss-tolerant direct detection of squeezing in each mode, which in turn permits mode sorting after amplification. As a result, we demonstrate, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the real-time monitoring of multimode squeezing. With a spatial light modulator sorting the modes, we simultaneously measure squeezing in nine spatial modes co-propagating within one beam. Although mode sorting and filtering reduce the detection efficiency to less than $0.3\%$, we observe high-purity squeezing of up to $-7.9 \pm 0.6$ dB -- to the best of our knowledge, the highest squeezing recorded for pulsed light. Furthermore, we demonstrate real-time, loss-tolerant characterization of continuous-variable entanglement and extend it to the detection of cluster states. Similar methods can be applied in the frequency domain, facilitating a crucial capability for scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing are two of the most popular quantum optimization heuristics. While QAOA is known to be able to approximate quantum annealing, the approximation requires QAOA angles to vanish with the problem size $n$, whereas optimized QAOA angles are observed to be size-independent for small $n$ and constant in the infinite-size limit. This fact led to a folklore belief that QAOA has a mechanism that is fundamentally different from quantum annealing. In this work, we provide evidence against this by analytically showing that QAOA energy approximates that of quantum annealing under two conditions, namely that angles vary smoothly from one layer to the next and that the sum is bounded by a constant. These conditions are known to hold for near-optimal QAOA angles empirically. Our proof relies on a series expansion of QAOA energy in sum of angles, which we show converges to quantum annealing limit as QAOA depth grows for constant sum of angles even if angles do not vanish with problem size $n$. A corollary of our results is a quadratic improvement for the bound on depth required to compile Trotterized quantum annealing of the SK model in the average case.</p>

            <p>Quantum Speed Limits (QSLs) are fundamentally linked to the tenets of quantum mechanics, particularly the energy-time uncertainty principle. Notably, the Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) bound and the Margolus-Levitin (ML) bound are prominent examples of QSLs. Recently, the notion of a quantum acceleration limit has been proposed for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems governed by arbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. This limit articulates that the rate of change over time of the standard deviation of the Hamiltonian operator-representing the acceleration of quantum evolution within projective Hilbert space-is constrained by the standard deviation of the time-derivative of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we extend our earlier findings to encompass any observable A within the framework of unitary quantum dynamics. This relationship signifies that the speed of the standard deviation of any observable is limited by the standard deviation of its associated velocity-like observable. Finally, for pedagogical purposes, we illustrate the relevance of our inequality by providing clear examples. We choose suitable observables related to the unitary dynamics of two-level quantum systems, as well as a harmonic oscillator within a finite-dimensional Fock space.</p>

            <p>We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</p>

            <p>Efficient quantum control is a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum technologies, from computation to sensing and communications. Several approaches in quantum control, e.g. optimal control and inverse engineering, use pulse amplitude and frequency shaping as control tools. Often, these approaches prescribe pulse shapes which are difficult or impossible to implement. To this end, we develop the concept of isoprobability classes of models of qubit dynamics, in which various pairs of time-dependent pulse amplitude and frequency generate the same transition probability profile (albeit different temporal evolutions toward this probability). In this manner, we introduce an additional degree of freedom, and hence flexibility in qubit control. Selection of hardware-aware temporal pulse shapes has the potential to decrease gate duration, overcome platform constraints and increase robustness to noise. We demonstrate this approach with two classes of isoprobability models, which derive from the established Landau-Majorana-Stückelberg-Zener (LMSZ) and Allen-Eberly-Hioe (AEH) classes. We experimentally validate the isoprobability equivalence on an IBM Quantum processor, quantifying agreement with numerical simulations via the mean squared error (MSE). Instead of frequency (i.e. detuning) shaping, which is difficult to implement on this platform, we exploit the time-dependent phase of the driving field to induce an effective detuning. Indeed, the temporal derivative of the phase function emulates a variable detuning, thereby avoiding the need for direct detuning control. The experimental validation of the isoprobability concept with the time-dependent phase control underscores the potential of this robust and accessible method for high-fidelity quantum operations, bringing us one step closer to scalable quantum control in various quantum applications.</p>

However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.</p>

We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption, demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.</p>

            <p>A quantum memory for light is expected to play a crucial role in quantum communication protocols and distributed quantum computing. In addition to storage and buffering, a quantum memory can be used for manipulations of stored states to allow more complex quantum network operations.

Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser cooled in an elongated magneto-optic trap to maximise optical depth. The results of our time-frequency Fourier transform can be understood as a temporal double slit. We show that the interference between time-separated pulses depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring similar capability to quantum optical systems.</p>

            <p>The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems that interact with their environments at arbitrary coupling strengths and are subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained not only by entropy production but also by this asymmetry. For general observables, we further prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term that characterizes environmental changes. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental limits of precision in a broad class of open quantum systems, beyond the traditional Markovian setting.</p>

            <h2>PT symmetry-enriched non-unitary criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuang-Hung Chou, Xue-Jia Yu, Po-Yao Chang</p>
            <p>The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Local reminiscence in the PXP model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Perciavalle, Gian Marco Rizzo, Francesco Plastina, Nicola Lo Gullo</p>
            <p>We study the emergence of local reminiscence in the PXP model, a constrained spin system realized in Rydberg atom arrays. The spectrum of this model is characterized by a majority of eigenstates that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, alongside a set of nonthermal eigenstates, known as quantum many-body scars, that violate it. While generic initial states lead to thermalization consistent with eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, special configurations generate non-ergodic dynamics and preserve memory of the initial state. In this work, we explore local memory retention using local fidelity and the dynamics of local observables. We find that two specific states, $\theta$-symmetric and blockaded states, exhibit robust local reminiscence, with fidelities near unity and suppressed fluctuations as the system size increases. Our results show that non-ergodic regimes can sustain stable local memory while still allowing for complex global dynamics, providing new insights into quantum many-body scars and constrained dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum speed limits based on Jensen-Shannon and Jeffreys divergences for general physical processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jucelino Ferreira de Sousa, Diego Paiva Pires</p>
            <p>We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing general physical processes. These QSLs were obtained using two families of entropic measures, namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which in turn defines a faithful distance of quantum states, and the square root of the quantum Jeffreys divergence. The results apply to both closed and open quantum systems, and are evaluated in terms of the Schatten speed of the evolved state, as well as cost functions that depend on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of both initial and instantaneous states of the quantum system. To illustrate our findings, we focus on the unitary and nonunitary dynamics of mixed single-qubit states. In the first case, we obtain speed limits $\textit{à la}$ Mandelstam-Tamm that are inversely proportional to the variance of the Hamiltonian driving the evolution. In the second case, we set the nonunitary dynamics to be described by the noisy operations: depolarizing channel, phase damping channel, and generalized amplitude damping channel. We provide analytical results for the two entropic measures, present numerical simulations to support our results on the speed limits, comment on the tightness of the bounds, and provide a comparison with previous QSLs. Our results may find applications in the study of quantum thermodynamics, entropic uncertainty relations, and also complexity of many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abyan Khabir Irfan, Chansu Yu</p>
            <p>Running quantum circuits on quantum computers does not always generate "clean" results, unlike on a simulator, as noise plays a significant role in any quantum device. To explore this, we experimented with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on quantum simulators and real quantum hardware. QAOA is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and requires hundreds or thousands of independent executions of the quantum circuit for optimization, which typically goes beyond the publicly available resources for quantum computing. We were granted access to the IBM Quantum System One at the Cleveland Clinic, the first on-premises IBM system in the U.S. This paper explores different optimization methods, techniques, and error mitigation methods to observe how they react to quantum noise differently, which is helpful for other researchers to understand the complexities of running QAOA on real quantum hardware and the challenges faced in dealing with noise.</p>

            <p>Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2 times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.</p>

            <p>We show that the quantum smooth label cover problem is RE-hard. This contrasts with the quantum unique label cover problem, which can be decided efficiently by Kempe, Regev, and Toner (FOCS'08). Our result aligns with the RE-hardness of the quantum label cover problem, which follows from the celebrated MIP* = RE result of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen (ACM'21). Additionally, we show that the quantum oracularized smooth label cover problem is also RE-hard. This aligns with the alternative quantum unique games conjecture on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label cover problem proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25). Our techniques employ a series of reductions from the halting problem to the quantum smooth label cover problem, and include a quantum-sound version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5 (STOC'96), which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seon-Geun Jeong, Mai Dinh Cong, Dae-Il Noh, Quoc-Viet Pham, Won-Joo Hwang</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing provides a practical realization of adiabatic quantum computation and has emerged as a promising approach for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, current devices remain constrained by sparse hardware connectivity, which requires embedding logical variables into chains of physical qubits. This embedding overhead limits scalability and reduces reliability as longer chains are more prone to noise-induced errors. In this work, building on the known structural result that the average chain length in clique embeddings grows linearly with the problem size, we develop a mathematical framework that connects embedding-induced overhead with hardware noise in D-Wave's Zephyr topology. Our analysis derives closed-form expressions for chain break probability and chain break fraction under a Gaussian control error model, establishing how noise scales with embedding size and how chain strength should be adjusted with chain length to maintain reliability. Experimental results from the Zephyr topology-based quantum processing unit confirm the accuracy of these predictions, demonstrating both the validity of the theoretical noise model and the practical relevance of the derived scaling rule. Beyond validating a theoretical model against hardware data, our findings establish a general embedding-aware noise framework that explains the trade-off between chain stability and logical coupler fidelity. Our framework advances the understanding of noise amplification in current devices and provides quantitative guidance for embedding-aware parameter tuning strategies.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Post-Selection for General Quantum LDPC Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seok-Hyung Lee, Lucas English, Stephen D. Bartlett</p>
            <p>Post-selection strategies that discard low-confidence computational results can significantly improve the effective fidelity of quantum error correction at the cost of reduced acceptance rates, which can be particularly useful for offline resource state generation. Prior work has primarily relied on the "logical gap" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%). Additionally, we integrate our approach with the sliding-window framework for real-time decoding, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions that eliminate unnecessary overheads. Notably, its performance matches or even surpasses the original strategy for global decoding, while exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds. Our approach provides a practical foundation for efficient post-selection in fault-tolerant quantum computing with QLDPC codes.</p>

            <p>Time crystals, as temporal analogs of space crystals, manifest as stable and periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum system, many-body interaction subjected to dissipation allows one to develop the time crystalline order in an unprecedented way, as refer to dissipative time crystals. Here we report the observation of multiple time crystals in the continuously driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gases, in which continuous time crystals, sub-harmonic time crystals, and high-harmonic time crystals are observed in the same system by manipulating the Rydberg excitation. Our work provides new ways to explore the nonequilibrium phases of matter in open systems. Such time crystals with persistent oscillation rooted in emergent quantum correlations, may emerge as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for instance, continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.</p>

            <p>In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout, requiring only two bound spins for its implementation. In conjunction with charge sensing techniques, SB has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect selectively different spin measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin-selective readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1 - 8 $\mu$s. Our method should help perform projective spin measurements with high spin-to-charge conversion fidelity in systems subject to strong SOC, will facilitate state leakage detection and enable complete readout of two-spin states.</p>

            <p>The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</p>

For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography.

Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</p>

            <p>The Markov gap, defined as the difference between reflected entropy and mutual information, serves as a diagnostic for quantum recoverability and multipartite entanglement. In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</p>

            <h2>A Calibration-Free Fixed Point of Curved Boolean Logic Matching the Fine-Structure Constant</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian R. P. von Liechtenstein</p>
            <p>We show that Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) admits a calibration-free fixed point at which the per-face holonomy theta_0 is the same across independent minimal faces (CHSH, KCBS, SAT_6). Equality is enforced by solving the two-component system F(delta, gamma_4, gamma_5, gamma_6) = (theta_0^(4) - theta_0^(5), theta_0^(5) - theta_0^(6)) = 0 with a Gauss-Newton method (no external scale). A finite-difference Jacobian is full rank at the solution, implying local uniqueness. Working at the coupling level g = |theta_0|/(2*pi*n) removes hidden length factors; at the equality point our normalization audit shows g = alpha (Thomson limit) within numerical tolerance. The SU(1,1) corner words and overlap placements used to compute theta_0 are specified exactly; we also report a variational minimax analysis on g and a pilot non-backtracking spectral density that coincides numerically with the per-edge coupling, suggesting a purely topological formulation. Scope: the match is to the low-energy (Thomson) limit; a full spectral equality on the contextual complex is left as a short conjecture. These results promote the CBL--alpha connection from a calibrated identification to a calibration-free derivation candidate.</p>
