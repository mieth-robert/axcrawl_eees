            <h2>Enhancing the Practical Reliability of Shor's Quantum Algorithm via Generalized Period Decomposition: Theory and Large-Scale Empirical Validation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Chen Liao, Chia-Hsin Liu, Yun-Cheng Tsai</p>
            <p>This work presents a generalized period decomposition approach, significantly improving the practical reliability of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study thus provides both theoretical advancements and substantial practical benefits, contributing meaningfully to the field of quantum algorithm research and the broader field of quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Undecidability of the Unitary Hitting Time Problem: No Universal Time-Step Selector and an Operational No-Go for Finite-Time Decisions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katsufumi Matsuura</p>
            <p>We study the Unitary Hitting Time Problem (UHTP) in quantum dynamics. Given computably described pure states |a>, |b> and a time-dependent unitary U(t), define the hitting time as the infimum of t > 0 such that the fidelity between U(t)|a> and |b> reaches a fixed threshold (with infinity if the threshold is never reached). We prove that there is no total algorithm that outputs this hitting time for all inputs; equivalently, the total UHTP is undecidable via a reduction from the halting problem. Operationally, we show a no-go theorem: for any fixed accuracy parameters, there is no universal finite-resource protocol that, for all computably described inputs, correctly outputs the hitting time while obeying uniform finite upper bounds on observation time and on dissipation/work. The proofs use reversible computation embedded into unitary dynamics, a fixed-target beacon construction, and a continuous-time lifting via piecewise-constant Hamiltonians. Our results target systems capable of embedding universal computation and complement prior undecidability results such as spectral-gap and quantum-control reachability. We distinguish logical time (inside the equations) from physical/operational time (of preparation, evolution, measurement), and show that universal time-step selection is impossible in both senses.</p>

            <h2>Choi echo: dynamical irreversibility and local decoherence in quantum many-body chaos</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Alfredo de Leon, Miguel Gonzalez, Carlos Diaz-Mejia</p>
            <p>Quantifying intrinsic irreversibility in open quantum dynamics is central to understanding decoherence and information loss in many-body systems. In this work, we introduce the Choi echo, which provides an operational interpretation of the purity of the Choi state, the state representation of a quantum channel, as a quantifier of the robustness of quantum correlations against local information erasure. We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics.</p>

            <h2>Information-Theoretic and Operational Measures of Quantum Contextuality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Can Günhan, Mehmet Zafer Gedik</p>
            <p>We propose an information -- theoretic framework for quantifying Kochen-Specker contextuality. Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic Equations for Feedback Control of Open Quantum Systems III: Full counting statistics for jump-based feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto J. B. Rosal, Guilherme Fiusa, Patrick P. Potts, Gabriel T. Landi</p>
            <p>In this work, we consider a general feedback protocol based on quantum-jump detections, where the last detected jump channel is stored in a memory and subsequently used to implement a feedback action, such as modifying the system Hamiltonian conditioned on the last jump. We show that the time evolution of this general protocol can be described by a Lindblad master equation defined in a hybrid classical-quantum space, where the classical part encodes the stored measurement record (memory) and the quantum part represents the monitored system. Moreover, we show that this new representation can be used to fully characterize the counting statistics of a system subject to a general jump-based feedback protocol. We apply the formalism to a three-level system coupled to two thermal baths operating as a thermal machine, and we show that jump-based feedback can be used to convert the information obtained from the jump detections into work. Our framework provides analytical tools that enable the characterization of key statistical properties of any counting observable under jump-based feedback, such as the average current, noise, correlation functions, and power spectrum.</p>

            <h2>Network-Irreducible Multiparty Entanglement in Quantum Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liuke Lyu, Pedro Lauand, William Witczak-Krempa</p>
            <p>We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Long-distance Continuous-variable Quantum-key-distribution with an Error-correcting Relay</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Nibedita Swain, Ryan J. Marshman, Josephine Dias, Alexander S. Solntsev, Timothy C. Ralph</p>
            <p>Noiseless linear amplifiers (NLAs) serve as an effective means to enable long-distance continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD), even under realistic conditions with non-unit reconciliation efficiency. Separately, unitary averaging has been suggested to mitigate some stochastic noise, including phase noise in continuous-variable states. In this work, we combine these two protocols to simultaneously compensate for thermal-loss effects and suppress phase noise, thereby enabling long-distance CV QKD that surpasses the repeaterless bound, the fundamental rate-distance limit, for repeaterless quantum communication systems.</p>

            <h2>A Survey of OAM-Encoded High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution: Foundations, Experiments, and Recent Trends</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Zhang, Zhenyu Cao, Yu Sun, Hu Jin</p>
            <p>High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) enhances information efficiency and noise tolerance by encoding data in large Hilbert spaces. The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light provides a scalable basis for such encoding and supports high-dimensional photonic communication. Practical OAM-based implementations remain constrained by challenges in state generation, transmission, and detection. This survey offers a consolidated overview of OAM-encoded HD-QKD, outlining fundamental principles, representative experiments, and system-level limitations. Recent progress in hybrid encodings, mode sorting, adaptive optics, and TF, CV, MDI, and DI frameworks is summarized with emphasis on practical feasibility.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Quantum Magnetic Sensing for Infrastructure-free Geo-localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Le, Shiqian Guo, Jianqing Liu</p>
            <p>Modern navigation systems rely heavily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), whose weak spaceborne signals are vulnerable to jamming, spoofing, and line-of-sight blockage. As an alternative, the Earth's magnetic field entails location information and is found critical to many animals' cognitive and navigation behavior. However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada. The results report that in high-gradient regions, gradient-space Mahalanobis search achieves sub-kilometer median localization error; while in magnetically smoother areas, corner-space search provides better accuracy and a $4-8\times$ reduction in runtime.</p>

            <h2>The Casimir-Polder interaction between atoms and hollow-core fibers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bettina Beverungen, Daniel Reiche, Kurt Busch, Francesco Intravaia</p>
            <p>The Casimir-Polder force acts on polarizable particles due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field that are modified by the presence of material bodies. We investigate the Casimir-Polder interaction for atoms near cylindrical fibers with hollow cores. This geometry represents one of the archetypal configurations encountered in numerous experimental setups designed to control and manipulate atoms in fundamental and quantum technological applications. Specifically, we analyze how the interplay of both geometrical and material-related length scales characterize the interaction, emphasizing the impact of the shell thickness. We develop a flexible and fast-converging numerical scheme for evaluating the interaction over a wide range of atom-cylinder separations at both zero and finite temperature. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analytical investigation of how various material properties modify the Casimir-Polder potential. Finally, we analyze and discuss a number of limiting cases and compare numerical computations with corresponding analytical asymptotic expressions. In particular, in this geometry the Casimir-Polder potential is able to distinguish between an ohmic and non-ohmic description of conductors. One of the most significant outcomes of our work is that the shell thickness emerges as a useful parameter for controlling the interaction, opening avenues for both fundamental physics and applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Polarization Entanglement in Atomic Biphotons via OAM-to-Spin Mapping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-Wei Lin, Yi-Ting Ma, Jiun-Shiuan Shiu, Yong-Fan Chen</p>
            <p>We demonstrate polarization-entangled biphotons in a cold-atom double-$\Lambda$ system, overcoming atomic selection rules that suppress polarization correlations and favor orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement. Using spatial light modulators, we coherently map a selected two-dimensional OAM subspace onto the polarization basis and thereby open an otherwise inaccessible polarization channel. Quantum-state tomography confirms that the mapping preserves the biphoton coherence. The four polarization Bell states are generated with fidelities of $92\text{-}94\%$ with few-percent statistical uncertainties, and an average Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter of $S=2.44$ verifies the survival of nonlocal correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first demonstration of OAM-to-polarization entanglement transfer in a cold-atom spontaneous four-wave mixing platform and establishes a practical interface for integrating atomic OAM resources with polarization-based quantum communication networks.</p>

            <h2>Highly Nondegenerate Entangled Photon Source for Fiber-Based Quantum Key Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasile-Laurentiu Dosan, Alek Lagarrigue, Alessandro Zannotti, Tushar Parab, Yannick Folwill, Fabian Steinlechner, Oliver de Vries</p>
            <p>Entangled photon sources (EPSs) are essential building blocks for scalable quantum communication and quantum key distribution (QKD). We present a stable, highly nondegenerate EPS based on type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a crossed-crystal configuration, generating photon pairs at 680~nm and 1550~nm when pumped by a 473~nm laser. This wavelength combination, reported here for the first time, simultaneously benefits from the peak detection efficiency of the most of the Si-SPADs in the visible/near-infrared spectral range and the low-loss fiber transmission of the telecom C-band. This configuration provides the most favorable balance between performance and cost for detection using Si-SPADs and InGaAs detectors. The source exhibits a measured spectral bandwidth of 300~GHz, corresponding to a spectral brightness of up to $1.9\times 10^3$~pairs~s$^{-1}$~mW$^{-1}$~GHz$^{-1}$. Heralding efficiencies reach 18~\% (signal) and 34~\% (idler) with Si-SPAD and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) detection. The entangled state achieves visibilities of $(97.3\pm 1.0)\,\%$ in the H/V basis and $(94.9\pm1.6)\,\%$ in the D/A basis, yielding a fidelity of $\geq(96.1\pm1.3)\,\%$. These results establish the presented EPS as a practical wavelength-hybrid platform for fiber-based QKD and emerging long-haul quantum network architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Tancara, Herbert Díaz-Moraga, Vicente Sepúlveda-Trivelli, Dardo Goyeneche</p>
            <p>While variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, their scalability is often hindered by the barren plateau problem. Among the proposals that have demonstrated robustness against this issue, the ADAPT-VQE algorithm stands out for ground state estimation, primarily due to its iterative ansatz construction. Although ADAPT-VQE has been extensively benchmarked on molecular Hamiltonians, where the ground states typically exhibit low entanglement, its performance for highly entangled ground states remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore a variant of this algorithm known as qubit-ADAPT-VQE, assessing its ability to achieve ground states with substantial entanglement in spin models. We focus on four-qubit systems and employ an algebraic entanglement classification to identify distinct entanglement classes among ground states, and consider a representative of each class as an initial state to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Our findings highlight the versatility of qubit-ADAPT-VQE, demonstrating that it accurately reaches the ground state across all entanglement classes and initial energy values.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Krylov algorithm using unitary decomposition for exact eigenstates of fermionic systems using quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush Asthana</p>
            <p>Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a useful framework for quantum simulations in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, offering a favorable trade-off between potential quantum speedups and practical resource demands. However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($\Delta t$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $\Delta t$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ of the error parameter $\epsilon$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $\epsilon \neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($\epsilon^2$) vs O($\Delta t$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $\epsilon$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $\epsilon$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Fully quantum theory of strong-field driven tunable entangled multi-photon states in HHG</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastián de-la-Peña, Heiko Appel, Angel Rubio, Ofer Neufeld</p>
            <p>Quantum high-harmonic generation (HHG) is a growing field of research with capabilities of providing high photon-number entangled states of light. However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Escaping AB caging via Floquet engineering: photo-induced long-range interference in an all-band-flat model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aamna Ahmed, Mónica Benito, Beatriz Pérez-González</p>
            <p>Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Deep Thermalization and Measurements of Quantum Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naga Dileep Varikuti, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.</p>

We outline a fabrication-ready diamond-on-insulator pathway towards modular unit cells that natively bridge visible color centers to the infrared spectrum for scalable quantum networks. We also present and analyze an end-to-end framework for considering single-photon coupling efficiency from a color center to a quantum network.

            <p>We develop a novel framework to engineer persistent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems governed by a time-independent Lindblad master equation. We show that oscillatory modes can be created when the Hamiltonian and jump operator can be expressed in the same block-diagonal form. A key feature of the framework is that the dissipator of the Lindblad master equation are generally non-zero. We identify the weak and strong conditions, where the onset of the oscillatory modes is dependent and independent of the parameters of the system, respectively. Our method extends beyond the typical decoherence-free subspace approach, in which the dissipator is zero. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using various models, showing how carefully tailored system-environment interactions can produce sustained coherent oscillations.</p>

To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications.

            <p>Light-injection attacks pose critical security threats to quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Conventional defense methods, such as isolators, filters, and optical power monitoring, are confronted with the threats of specific attacks and the limitations in integration. To address this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an integrated attack sensing and automatic response unit utilizing the photorefractive effect in a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Our unit provides a high rejection ratio against non-resonant injected light. For resonant attacks exceeding tens of microwatts, the unit can autonomously attenuate the transmission of the quantum signal light, leading to a significant suppression of the secret key rate. This work enhances the security of QKD systems against light-injection attacks by providing a highly sensitive, broadband, and on-chip defense mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Generating strong mechanical squeezing via combined squeezed vacuum field and two-tone driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Jie Wu, Huan-Huan Cheng, Cheng-Hua Bai, Shao-Xiong Wu</p>
            <p>We propose a novel scheme for generating mechanical squeezed states based on the combined mechanism of a two-tone driving and a squeezed vacuum field. This innovative approach achieves a remarkable improvement in mechanical squeezing performance across the entire range of red/blue detuning ratios. Our study reveals that the squeezed vacuum field not only induces position squeezing of the mechanical oscillator but also facilitates momentum squeezing through phase matching. Moreover, the total squeezing degree exhibits nonlinear enhancement with the increasing of squeezing parameter $r$. The mechanical squeezed state exhibits a $2\pi$-periodic dependence in relation to the squeezing phase $\theta$, offering experimental implementation with a high degree of operational flexibility. Notably, the scheme exhibits strong robustness against cavity dissipation and environmental thermal noise, substantially relaxing the strict parameter-matching requirements inherent in conventional approaches.</p>

            <h2>Integrated Generation and Purification of Entangled Coherent States for Non-Gaussian Teleportation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ananga Mohan Datta, William J. Munro, Nicolo Lo Piparo, Kae Nemoto</p>
            <p>Entangled coherent states (ECS) provide a powerful non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum communication, but their generation in scalable architectures remains challenging. We propose an integrated photonic scheme that creates high-fidelity ECS from a two-mode squeezed vacuum via photon subtraction in a symmetric waveguide trimer. The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so. Our results show that integrated photon subtraction and catalysis enable practical, chip-compatible generation of non-Gaussian entanglement suitable for advanced quantum teleportation and continuous-variable quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Entanglement swapping is a protocol that details how to create entanglement between previously uncorrelated particles. Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances. Our work opens the path to the exploitation of quantum dot entangled-photon sources in quantum repeater networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio B. Acedo, Pablo Rodriguez-Grasa, Pablo Garcia-Azorin, Javier Gonzalez-Conde</p>
            <p>While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds great potential, its practical realization on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware has been hindered by the limitations of variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Recent evidence suggests that VQCs suffer from severe trainability and noise-related issues, leading to growing skepticism about their long-term viability. However, the possibility of implementing learning models directly at the pulse-control level remains comparatively unexplored and could offer a promising alternative. In this work, we formulate a pulse-based variant of data re-uploading, embedding trainable parameters directly into the native system's dynamics. We benchmark our approach on a simulated superconducting transmon processor with realistic noise profiles. The pulse-based model consistently outperforms its gate-based counterpart, exhibiting higher test accuracy and improved generalization under equivalent noise conditions. Moreover, by systematically increasing noise strength, we show that pulse-level implementations retain higher fidelity for longer, demonstrating enhanced resilience to decoherence and control errors. These results suggest that pulse-native architectures, though less explored, may offer a viable and hardware-aligned path forward for practical QML in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Surface-Induced Decoherence of NV Centers in Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonah Nagura, Mykyta Onizhuk, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Hoch, Taira Giordani, Gonzalo Carvacho, Nicolò Spagnolo, Fabio Sciarrino</p>
            <p>A Bernoulli factory is a model for randomness manipulation that transforms an initial Bernoulli random variable into another Bernoulli variable by applying a predetermined function relating the output bias to the input one. In literature, quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory schemes have been proposed, which encode both the input and output variables using qubit amplitudes. This fundamental concept can serve as a subroutine for quantum algorithms that involve Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods, or that require data encryption, like in blind quantum computation. In this work, we present a characterisation of the complexity of the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory by providing a lower bound on the required number of qubits needed to implement the protocol, an upper bound on the success probability and the quantum circuit that saturates the bounds. We also formalise and analyse two different variants of the original problem that address the possibility of increasing the number of input biases or the number of functions implemented by the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. The obtained results can be used as a framework for randomness manipulation via such an approach.</p>

            <p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, widely applied in logistics and transportation. As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes. This study investigates the potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical method, to solve TSP under realistic constraints. We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios. This study advances quantum optimization and lays groundwork for future large-scale applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kregg Elliot Arms, Martin James McHugh, Joseph Edward Nyhan, William Frederick Reus, James Loudon Ulrich</p>
            <p>We consolidate recent theoretical advances in Detector Error Model (DEM) estimation and formalize several algorithms to learn DEM parameters and structure from syndromes without using a decoder, demonstrating recovery of known DEMs from simulated syndromes with precision limited only by finite-sample effects. We then apply these algorithms to estimate DEMs from Google's 72- and 105-qubit chips. Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported.</p>

Second, we leverage the expressivity of the LUCI framework as an intermediate representation, using integer linear programming to find performant physical circuits from the large space of valid LUCI circuits. We show that on the $d = 11$ surface code at $1\%(3\%)$ dropout rate for qubits and couplers, these optimizations allow for a total improvement of $14.5\%(23.6\%)$ over $4d$ round of syndrome extraction using the SI1000 noise model at $0.1\%$ noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piotr Masajada, Aby Philip, Alexander Streltsov</p>
            <p>We present entcalc, a Python and MATLAB package for estimating the geometric entanglement of multipartite quantum states. The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper bounds on the geometric entanglement, thereby identifying an interval in which the true value lies. We provide several methods to compute the lower bound, enabling users to balance accuracy against computational cost. We apply entcalc to several representative examples, including for $3\otimes3$ PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of selected three-qubit spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. We observe signatures of quantum phase transitions by quantifying entanglement in spin chains. We also demonstrate that entanglement between non-neighbouring sites can be activated by tuning the external magnetic field. In all tested cases, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is found to be very small, indicating that entcalc provides highly accurate estimates of the geometric entanglement for these states.</p>

            <p>Recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that the quantum Fisher information associated with estimating the separation between two optical point sources remains finite at small separations, effectively opening new routes to super-resolution imaging of simultaneously emitting sources. Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged.</p>

            <h2>Partitioned Expansions for Approximate Tensor Network Contractions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glen Evenbly, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan</p>
            <p>We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum dynamics of a single bosonic cavity subject to two-photon driving and two-photon dissipation in the presence of finite detuning. Exploiting a hidden time-reversal symmetry, the Wigner representation and the WKB method, we introduce an effective phase-space potential for description of the steady state. It reveals two attracting points, which are metastable due to quantum fluctuations. By employing the Keldysh real-time path integral formalism, we compute the instanton trajectory governing the quantum activation process between these attractors and establish a fundamental connection with the Wigner representation. This relation unifies the steady-state phase-space description with dynamical quantum activation processes. We also derive an analytical expression for the decoherence rate of the system. Our work provides a coherent theoretical framework for analyzing quantum bistability, metastability, and decoherence in driven-dissipative nonlinear resonators, with direct implications for the design of bosonic qubits and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.</p>

            <p>Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation.

A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions.</p>

Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parvinder Solanki, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto</p>
            <p>Speeding up the relaxation dynamics of many-body quantum systems is important in a variety of contexts, including quantum computation and state preparation. We demonstrate that such acceleration can be universally achieved via transient stochastic resetting. This means that during an initial time interval of finite duration, the dynamics is interrupted by resets that take the system to a designated state at randomly selected times. We illustrate this idea for few-body open systems and also for a challenging many-body case, where a first-order phase transition leads to a divergence of relaxation time. In all scenarios, a significant and sometimes even exponential acceleration in reaching the stationary state is observed, similar to the so-called Mpemba effect. The universal nature of this speedup lies in the fact that the design of the resetting protocol only requires knowledge of a few macroscopic properties of the target state, such as the order parameter of the phase transition, while it does not necessitate any fine-tuned manipulation of the initial state.</p>

Starting from thermal initial states, we derive compact, closed-form results for bipartite entanglement between particle-antiparticle partners in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients. For bosons, thermal fluctuations enhance production but suppress quantum correlations: the logarithmic negativity is nonzero only below a (mode-dependent) critical temperature $T_c$. At fixed $T$, entanglement appears only above a critical field $E_{\text{crit,entang}}$. For fermions, we observe a qualitatively different pattern: at finite $T$ entanglement exists only within a finite window $E_{\text{min}} < E < E_{\text{max}}$, with a temperature-independent optimal field strength $E_{*}$ that maximizes the logarithmic negativity. Entanglement is vanishing above $T_{\text{max}}=\omega/\text{arcsinh}(1)$. We give quantitative estimates for analog experiments, where our entanglement criteria convert directly into concrete temperature and electric field constraints. These findings identify realistic regimes where the quantum character of Schwinger physics may be tested in the laboratory.</p>

            <p>Cosmological perturbations generated during inflation exhibit striking quantum features, including entanglement and high circuit complexity. Yet their observational signatures remain effectively indistinguishable from classical stochastic variables. We quantify this tension by showing that quantum inflationary perturbations are continuous variable stabilizer states with vanishing quantum magic, a necessary resource for universal quantum computation as measured by Wigner negativity. Consequently, despite their quantum origins and description, these states can be efficiently simulated using classical algorithms. We further show that the Wigner negativity arising from primordial non-Gaussianity is suppressed not only by the non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}$, but also by the exponential squeezing of the perturbations. Viewing the early universe as a "high complexity, low magic" regime provides another perspective of what it means for the origin of structure in the universe to be "quantum."</p>

            <p>We report on a search for a gravitationally bound solar axion halo using data from the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), a worldwide array of magnetically shielded atomic magnetometers with sensitivity to exotic spin couplings. Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo. No statistically significant candidate signals are observed. We set 95% confidence-level upper limits on the amplitude of the axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field over the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 20 Hz, translating to constraints on the linear and quadratic axion-proton couplings for halo densities predicted by gravitational capture models and for the maximum overdensities allowed by planetary ephemerides. In the quadratic coupling case, our limits surpass existing astrophysical bounds by over two orders of magnitude across much of the accessible parameter space.</p>

            <h2>Excitation energies and UV-Vis absorption spectra from INDO/s+ML</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ezekiel Oyeniyi, Omololu Akin-Ojo</p>
            <p>The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement in C$^*$-algebras: tensor products of state spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magdalena Musat, Mikael Rørdam</p>
            <p>We analyze the Namioka-Phelps minimal and maximal tensor products of compact convex sets arising as state spaces of C$^*$-algebras, and, relatedly, study entanglement in (infinite dimensional) C$^*$-algebras. The minimal Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the state spaces of two C$^*$-algebras is shown to correspond to the set of separable (= un-entangled) states on the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. We show that these maximal and minimal tensor product of the state spaces agree precisely when one of the two C$^*$-algebras is commutative. This confirms an old conjecture by Barker in the case where the compact convex sets are state spaces of C$^*$-algebras. The Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the trace simplexes of two C$^*$-algebras is shown always to be the trace simplex of the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. This can be used, for example, to show that the trace simplex of (any) tensor product of two C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex if and only if the trace simplex of each of the C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex.</p>

            <p>We characterise an efficient optically-heated neutral atom source for ion trapping.

We calibrate a thermal model for the source's internal temperature by imaging the fluorescence of a collimated flux of neutral calcium that effuses from the oven at various optical heating powers. We show that the thermal performance of this oven is mainly limited by radiative losses. We explore the effect of second-stage photo-ionisation laser power on the loading rate, and identify a path beyond the loading rates reported in this study. We predict that this source is also well-suited to a wide range of metals used in ion-trapping.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stan P. J. Koenis, Lucas Maisel Licerán, Henk T. C. Stoof</p>
            <p>Conventional wisdom dictates that the conducting edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family are protected by time-reversal symmetry. However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yeimer Zambrano, Aleksey Alekseev, Konrad J. Kapcia, Krzysztof Cichy, Agnieszka Cichy</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heiko Georg Menzler, Suman Mondal, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner</p>
            <p>We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.</p>

            <p>Laser cooling is fundamental to precise control and interrogation of atomic quantum systems. In the context of quantum computing and metrology with trapped ions, the integrated optical control of interest for scaling may additionally enable increased performance of coherent and incoherent operations. Here we utilize multi-channel integrated delivery of ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths required for calcium ion control including in passively phase-stable ultraviolet standing waves to demonstrate rapid, broadband laser cooling. We experimentally verify a long-standing prediction, realizing Doppler cooling to below the conventional Doppler limit at a standing-wave (SW) node. Utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), we experimentally cool motional modes spanning an approximately 5 MHz bandwidth from the Doppler temperature to near the ground state within 150 $\mu$s, reaching $\bar n \approx 0.05$ phonon number occupancies for the target mode. Direct evaluation against the comparable running-wave (RW) scheme shows the SW implementation's simultaneous advantage in cooling rate, motional mode bandwidth, and final phonon number as previously theoretically predicted. Our results demonstrate structured light's capability for robust ground-state laser cooling, and a clear advantage in a fundamental functionality enabled by scalable approaches to optical control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Wilson</p>
            <p>We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.</p>

            <h2>Performance Analysis of Quantum CSS Error-Correcting Codes via MacWilliams Identities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Forlivesi, Lorenzo Valentini, Marco Chiani</p>
            <p>We analyze the performance of quantum stabilizer codes, one of the most important classes for practical implementations, on both symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels. To this aim, we first derive the weight enumerator (WE) for the undetectable errors based on the quantum MacWilliams identities. The WE is then used to evaluate tight upper bounds on the error rate of CSS quantum codes with \acl{MW} decoding. For surface codes we also derive a simple closed form expression of the bounds over the depolarizing channel. We introduce a novel approach that combines the knowledge of WE with a logical operator analysis, allowing the derivation of the exact asymptotic error rate for short codes. For example, on a depolarizing channel with physical error rate $\rho \to 0$, the logical error rate $\rho_\mathrm{L}$ is asymptotically $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16 \rho^2$ for the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16.3 \rho^2$ for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 18.7 \rho^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code, and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 149.3 \rho^3$ for the $[[41,1,5]]$ surface code. For larger codes our bound provides $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 1215 \rho^4$ and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 663 \rho^5$ for the $[[85,1,7]]$ and the $[[181,1,10]]$ surface codes, respectively. Finally, we extend our analysis to include realistic, noisy syndrome extraction circuits by modeling error propagation throughout gadgets. This enables estimation of logical error rates under faulty measurements. The performance analysis serves as a design tool for developing fault-tolerant quantum systems by guiding the selection of quantum codes based on their error correction capability. Additionally, it offers a novel perspective on quantum degeneracy, showing it represents the fraction of non-correctable error patterns shared by multiple logical operators.</p>

            <h2>General teleportation channel in Fermionic Quantum Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanam Khan, R. Jehadeesan, Sibasish Ghosh</p>
            <p>Quantum Teleportation is a very useful scheme for transferring quantum information. Given that the quantum information is encoded in a state of a system of distinguishable particles, and given that the shared bi-partite entangled state is also that of a system of distinguishable particles, the $\textit{optimal teleportation fidelity}$ of the shared state is known to be $(F_{max}d+1)/(d+1)$ with $F_{max}$ being the `maximal singlet fraction' of the shared state. However, Parity Superselection Rule (PSSR) in Fermionic Quantum Theory (FQT) puts constraint on the allowed set of physical states and operations, and thereby, leads to a different notion of Quantum entanglement - locally accessible and locally inaccessible. In the present work, we derive an expression for the $\textit{optimal teleportation fidelity}$ of locally accessible entanglement preservation, given that the quantum information to be teleported is encoded in fermionic modes of dimension $2^N \times 2^N$ using $2^N \times 2^N$-dim shared fermionic resource between the sender and receiver. To get the optimal teleportation fidelity in FQT, we introduce PSSR restricted twirling operations and establish fermionic state-channel isomorphism. Remarkably, we notice that the structure of the canonical form of twirl invariant fermionic shared state differs from that of the $\textit{isotropic state}$ -- the corresponding canonical invariant form for teleportation in Standard Quantum Theory (SQT). In this context, we also introduce restricted Clifford twirling operation that constitute the Unitary 2-design in case of FQT for experimentally validating such optimal average fidelity. Finally, we discuss the preservation of locally inaccessible entanglement for a class of fermionic teleportation channel.</p>

            <h2>Universal adapters between quantum LDPC codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esha Swaroop, Tomas Jochym-O'Connor, Theodore J. Yoder</p>
            <p>We propose the repetition code adapter as a way to perform joint logical Pauli measurements within a quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codeblock or between separate such codeblocks, thus providing a flexible tool for fault-tolerant computation with quantum LDPC codes. This adapter is universal in the sense that it works regardless of the LDPC codes involved and the logical Paulis being measured. The construction achieves joint logical Pauli measurement of $t$ weight $O(d)$ operators using $O(d)$ time and $\tilde O(td)$ additional qubits and checks, up to a factor polylogarithmic in $d$. As a special case, for some geometrically-local codes in fixed $D\ge2$ dimensions, only $O(td)$ additional qubits and checks are required instead. By extending the adapter in the case $t=2$, we also construct a toric code adapter that uses $O(d^2)$ additional qubits and checks to perform addressable logical CNOT gates on arbitrary LDPC codes via Dehn twists. To obtain these results, we develop a novel weaker form of graph edge expansion and the $\mathsf{SkipTree}$ algorithm, which ensures a sparse transformation between different weight-2 check bases for the classical repetition code.</p>

            <p>The conventional paradigm of quantum computing is discrete: it utilizes discrete sets of gates to realize bitstring-to-bitstring mappings, some of them arguably intractable for classical computers. In parameterized quantum approaches, the input becomes continuous and the output represents real-valued functions. While the universality of discrete quantum computers is well understood, basic questions remained open in the continuous case. We focus on universality on multivariate functions. Current approaches require either a number of qubits scaling linearly with the dimension of the input for fixed encodings, or a tunable encoding procedure in single-qubit circuits. The question of whether universality can be reached with a fixed encoding and sub-linearly many qubits remained open for the last five years. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for arbitrary multivariate functions. We provide two methods: (i) a single-qubit circuit where each coordinate of the arguments to the function to represent is input independently, and (ii) a multi-qubit approach where all coordinates are input in one step, with number of qubits scaling logarithmically with the dimension of the argument of the function of interest. We view the first result of inherent and fundamental interest, whereas the second result opens the path towards representing functions whose arguments are densely encoded in a unitary operation, possibly encoding for instance quantum processes.</p>

            <p>Recently, Hadfield et al. proposed the quantum alternating operator ansatz algorithm (QAOA+), an extension of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs). Compared with QAOA, QAOA+ enables the search for optimal solutions within a feasible solution space by encoding problem constraints into the mixer Hamiltonian, thereby reducing the search space and eliminating the possibility of yielding infeasible solutions. However, QAOA+ may incur high overall gate costs when the mixer is applied to all qubits in each layer, and each mixer is costly to implement. To address this challenge, an adaptive mixer allocation strategy is tailored for QAOA+. The resulting algorithm, which integrates this strategy into the original QAOA+ framework, is referred to as AMA-QAOA+. Unlike QAOA+, AMA-QAOA+ adaptively applies the mixer to a subset of qubits in each layer of the mixer unitary operator based on an evaluation function. The performance of AMA-QAOA+ is evaluated on the maximum independent set problem. Numerical simulation results show that, under the same number of optimization runs, AMA-QAOA+ achieves better solution quality than QAOA+, with the optimal approximation ratio improved by $5.30\%$ on ER random graphs and $5.41\%$ on 3-regular graphs. Moreover, AMA-QAOA+ significantly reduces the CNOT gate consumption, requiring only $15.30\%$ and $25.18\%$ of the CNOT gates used by QAOA+ on ER and 3-regular random graphs, respectively. These results demonstrate that AMA-QAOA+ enhances solution quality and computational efficiency, enabling the design of more compact and resource-efficient quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Newton Loebens</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study the recurrence of Open Quantum Walks induced by finite-dimensional coins on the line ($\mathbb{Z}$) and on the grid ($\mathbb{Z}^2$). Two versions are considered: discrete-time open quantum walks (OQW) and continuous-time open quantum walks (CTOQW). We present three distinct recurrence criteria for OQWs on $\mathbb{Z}$, each adapted to different types of coins. The first criterion applies to coins whose auxiliary map has a unique invariant state, resulting in the first recurrence criterion for Lazy OQWs. The second one applies to Lazy OQWs of dimension 2, where we provide a complete characterization of the recurrence for this low-dimensional case. The third one presents a general criterion for finite-dimensional coins in the non-lazy case, which generalizes many of the previously known results for OQWs on $\mathbb{Z}$. Also, we present a general recurrence criterion for OQWs on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ via the open quantum jump chain, obtained from a recurrence criterion for CTOQWs on $\mathbb{Z}^2$.</p>

            <p>The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, establishing provably tight bounds between them. We use these results to refine other divergence inequalities, in particular sharpening bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with Rényi divergences.</p>

            <p>Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', quantifies the deviation of quantum states from stabilizer states, capturing the complexity necessary for quantum computational advantage. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness in disordered many-body localized (MBL) systems using the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Leveraging a phenomenological description based on the $\ell$-bit model, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that interactions profoundly influence nonstabilizerness spreading, inducing a power-law growth of SRE that markedly contrasts with the rapid saturation observed in ergodic systems. We validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of the disordered transverse-field Ising model, showing excellent agreement across various disorder strengths, system sizes, and initial states. Additionally, we uncover a universal relationship between SRE and entanglement entropy, revealing their common scaling in the MBL regime independent of disorder strength and system size. Our results offer critical insights into the interplay of disorder, interactions, and complexity in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>In the current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, simulating and verifying noisy quantum circuits is crucial but faces challenges such as quantum state explosion and complex noise representations, constraining simulation and equivalence checking to circuits with a limited number of qubits. This paper introduces an approximation algorithm for simulating and assessing the equivalence of noisy quantum circuits, specifically designed to improve scalability under low-noise conditions. The approach utilizes a novel tensor network diagram combined with singular value decomposition to approximate the tensors of quantum noises. The implementation is based on Google's TensorNetwork Python package for contraction. Experimental results on realistic quantum circuits with realistic hardware noise models indicate that our algorithm can simulate and check the equivalence of QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits with around 200 qubits and 20 noise operators, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in scalability and speed.</p>

            <p>A key objective of computational solid state physics is to predict electronic properties of periodic materials. However, electronic structure simulations based on density functional theory fail to predict experimental results if correlations are not properly accounted for. Here, we report a sample-based quantum diagonalization workflow for simulating electronic states of periodic materials, and for predicting their band gaps. To that end, we devise a general lattice Hamiltonian representation in which material-specific, electronic interaction parameters are obtained self-consistently. Two exemplar, wide-gap materials - hafnium dioxide and zirconium dioxide - are expressed as quantum circuits that leverage the lattice representation with a materials-specific parametrization. We sample the quantum circuits on a state-of-the-art, superconducting quantum processor and diagonalize the lattice Hamiltonian in the reduced configuration subspaces with standard techniques. Our method outperforms select quantum-chemical benchmarks as well as approaches based on density functional theory, the standard reference in materials simulation of solids. Importantly, the quantum-computed band gap predictions for the two dielectrics agree with independent lab experiments. In essence, quantum-classical hybrid simulation workflows on pre-fault tolerant quantum computers produce useful, experimentally verifiable property predictions in applied materials science.</p>

            <h2>A note on the quantum Wielandt inequality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Owen Ekblad</p>
            <p>In this note, we prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive unital Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac.</p>

            <p>In this work we map NISQ-friendly implementations of the non-interacting QCA to a circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) hardware. We perform both noiseless and noisy simulations of the QCA one particle sector, namely the Quantum Walk, on $N$-cycles and $N \times N$ torus graphs. Moreover, within this framework, we also investigate the search problem and present a circuit for preparing the W state (i.e., the Dicke state with hamming weight one) using only N-1 $\sqrt{\text{iSWAP}}$ gates and no ancilla qubits. The noiseless simulations are conducted with the Qiskit Aer simulator, while the noisy simulations with C12 Quantum Electronics' in-house noisy emulator, \textit{Callisto}. We benchmark the performance of our implementations by analyzing the simulations via relevant metrics and quantities such as the state count distributions, the Hellinger Fidelity, the $\ell^{1}$ distance, the hitting time, and success probability. Our results demonstrate that the QCA framework, in combination with cQED processors, holds promise as an effective platform for early NISQ implementations of Quantum Walk and Quantum Walk Search algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution with Polynomial Resources in Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Zhang, Jizhe Lai, Xian Wu, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Imaginary-time evolution is fundamental for analyzing quantum many-body systems, yet classical simulation requires exponentially growing resources in both system size and evolution time. While quantum approaches reduce the system-size scaling, existing methods rely on heuristic techniques with measurement precision or success probability that deteriorates as evolution time increases. We present a quantum algorithm that prepares normalized imaginary-time evolved states using an adaptive normalization factor to maintain a stable success probability over long imaginary-time intervals. Our algorithm approximates the target state with error polynomially small in the inverse imaginary time using a polynomial number of elementary quantum gates and a single ancilla qubit, with success probability close to one. When the initial state has reasonable overlap with the ground state, this algorithm also achieves polynomial resource cost in the system size. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical analysis for evolution time up to 50, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness for long-time evolution. Building on this technique, we further develop imaginary-time-evolution-based algorithms for ground-state-related problems and for simulating open quantum systems. These algorithms reduce circuit depth compared with existing methods and illustrate the effectiveness of imaginary-time evolution in early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Just as classical computing relies on distributed systems, the quantum computing era requires new kinds of infrastructure and software tools. Quantum networks will become the backbone of hybrid, quantum-augmented data centers, in which quantum algorithms are distributed over a local network of quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via shared entanglement. In this context, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number of inter-QPU communications. Here we describe key features of the quantum compiler araQne, which is designed to minimize distribution cost, measured by the number of entangled pairs required to distribute a monolithic quantum circuit using gate teleportation protocols. We establish the crucial role played by circuit reordering strategies, which strongly reduce the distribution cost compared to a baseline approach.</p>

            <h2>Local-Frame Covariance and the Relational Origin of Quantum Causal Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Issam Ibnouhsein</p>
            <p>The process-matrix framework models quantum correlations without assuming a predefined global causal order, yet its standard Choi-Jamiolkowski construction implicitly presupposes a globally aligned Hilbert-space basis across all local laboratories. This makes the formalism causally indefinite yet kinematically absolute. To achieve full relational consistency, we impose the principle of local frame independence: physical predictions must remain invariant under independent unitary redefinitions of each laboratory's local basis. We formalize this requirement as a local gauge symmetry and derive the corresponding covariant representation of any process by averaging over the symmetry group. The image of this twirling operation forms a strict subset of the cone of causally separable processes. Covariance thus enforces a superselection rule for causal order, showing that indefinite causal order is not an intrinsic feature of nature but a relational coherence that exists only relative to a physical system establishing a shared quantum reference frame.</p>

            <h2>Achieving quantum-limited sub-Rayleigh identification of incoherent sources with arbitrary intensities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danilo Triggiani, Cosmo Lupo</p>
            <p>The Rayleigh diffraction limit imposes a fundamental restriction on the resolution of direct imaging systems, hindering the identification of incoherent optical sources, such as celestial bodies in astronomy and fluorophores in bioimaging. Recent advances in quantum sensing have shown that this limit can be circumvented through spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) and photon detection, i.e. a semi-classical detection strategy. However, the general optimality for arbitrary intensity distributions and bright sources remains unproven. In this work, we develop a general model for incoherent light with arbitrary intensity undergoing diffraction. We employ this framework to compute the quantum Chernoff exponent for generic incoherent-source discrimination problems, focusing on the sub-diffraction regime. We show that, surprisingly, SPADE measurements saturate the quantum Chernoff bound only when certain compatibility conditions are met. These findings suggest that collective measurements may actually be needed to achieve the ultimate quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of specific incoherent sources. For the fully general case, our analysis can still be used to find the best SPADE configurations, generally achieved through a rotation of the SPADE interferometer that depends on the discrimination task. We also simulated the efficiency of a simplified Bayesian test that we developed for this identification task and show that the saturation of the Chernoff bound is already achieved for a finite number of repetitions $N\leqslant 5000$. Our results advance the theory of quantum-limited optical discrimination, with possible applications in diagnostics, automated image interpretation, and galaxy identification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Kremer, Ali Javadi-Abhari, Priyanka Mukhopadhyay</p>
            <p>In this paper we study the potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) in order to synthesize quantum circuits, while optimizing the T-count and CS-count, of unitaries that are exactly implementable by the Clifford+T and Clifford+CS gate sets, respectively. We have designed our RL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us to perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also incorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order to reduce the search complexity. As a result, compared to previous works, we are able to implement significantly larger unitaries, in less time, with much better success rate and improvement factor. Our results for Clifford+T synthesis on two qubit unitaries achieve close-to-optimal decompositions for up to 100 T gates, 5 times more than previous RL algorithms and to the best of our knowledge, the largest instances achieved with any method to date. Our RL algorithm is able to recover previously-known optimal linear complexity algorithm for T-count-optimal decomposition of 1 qubit unitaries. We illustrate significant reduction in the asymptotic T-count estimate of important primitives like controlled cyclic shift (43%), controlled adder (14.3%) and multiplier (14%), without adding any extra ancilla. For 2-qubit Clifford+CS unitaries, our algorithm achieves a linear complexity, something that could only be accomplished by a previous algorithm using SO(6) representation.</p>

            <h2>Exact Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations for Reverse Diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Einar Gabbassov</p>
            <p>The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are analytical quantum stochastic differential equations for reverse diffusion, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate stochastic reverse processes for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. We show that the reverse processes generalize the forward dynamics by combining the noise effects of the forward processes with an additional non-Markovian stochastic drift that dynamically steers a quantum state back to its initial configuration. Consequently, the exact SDEs admit closed-form solutions that can be implemented in real-time without the need for variational techniques. Our findings establish an analytical framework for quantum state recovery, noise-resilient quantum gates, quantum generative modelling, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Unified Bulk-Entanglement Correspondence in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xudong Zhang, Zhaoyu Sun, Bin Guo</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) fundamentally invalidates the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), leading topological diagnostics into a crisis. While the non-Bloch polarization $P_{\beta}$ defined on the generalized Brillouin zone restores momentum-space topology, a direct, robust real-space bulk probe has remained elusive. We resolve this by establishing a universal correspondence between $P_{\beta}$ and the entanglement polarization $\chi$ of the biorthogonal ground state. Introducing a quasi-reciprocal Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ that removes the NHSE while preserving bulk topology, we rigorously prove the fundamental identity $P_{\beta} \equiv \chi(\tilde{H})\pmod 1$ in the thermodynamic limit under the quasi-locality assumption. Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $\chi(\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Ren, Daniel Quevedo, Salah Sukkarieh, Guodong Shi</p>
            <p>Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</p>

            <p>Demonstrating the practical utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware for recurrent tasks in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery is of paramount importance. We tackle this challenge by performing three-dimensional protein pockets hydration-site prediction on a quantum computer. Formulating the water placement problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), we use a hybrid approach coupling a classical three-dimensional reference-interaction site model (3D-RISM) to an efficient quantum optimization solver, to run various hardware experiments up to 123 qubits. Matching the precision of classical approaches, our results reproduced experimental predictions on real-life protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, through a detailed resource estimation analysis, we show that accuracy can be systematically improved with increasing number of qubits, indicating that full quantum utility is in reach. Finally, we provide evidence that advantageous situations could be found for systems where classical optimization struggles to provide optimal solutions. The method has potential for assisting simulations of protein-ligand complexes for drug lead optimization and setup of docking calculations.</p>

            <p>We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sridhar Tayur</p>
            <p>A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases. Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization--group and effective--action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics. A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity- motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</p>

The model is observed to display trivial and non-trivial insulator phases and a topologically non-trivial M${ö}$bius metallic phase. The driving field amplitude is shown to be a control parameter causing topological phase transitions in this model. While the system displays zero modes in the metallic phase apart from the non-trivial insulator phase, the metallic zero modes are not robust, as the ones found in the insulating phase. We further find that zero modes' energy converges slowly to zero as a function of the number of dimers in the M${ö}$bius metallic phase compared to the non-trivial insulating phase.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $> 400$-fold and $> 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</p>

            <p>Spin waves propagating in magnetic materials exhibit nonlinear behavior at large amplitudes due to the competition between excitation and relaxation, providing an attractive platform for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. In particular, spin waves with a non-zero wavenumber that carry momentum undergo nonlinear relaxation and experience wavenumber modulation in the nonlinear regime. This nonlinearity has been observed experimentally, for example in S. R. Lake et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 034010 (2022), but a quantitative comparison with theory has not yet been carried out. Here, We image nonlinear spin-wave propagation in two yttrium iron garnet thin films with distinct spin-wave decay rates using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. We obtain quantitative distributions of spin-wave amplitude and phase as a function of the excitation microwave strength. As a result, we observe a threshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become evident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical predictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the amplitude of the spin waves increases, we observe modulation of the wavenumber across the field of view. We attribute this modulation primarily to a reduction in the saturation magnetization caused by incoherent spin waves generated by multi-magnon scattering. Our quantitative measurements provide a pathway for visualizing nonlinear spin-wave dynamics and are crucial for deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p>

            <p>We discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary "code CFT." The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincaré series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.</p>

            <h2>From hidden order to skyrmions: Quantum Hall states in an extended Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian J. Pauw, Ulrich Schollwöck, Nathan Goldman, Sebastian Paeckel, Felix A. Palm</p>
            <p>The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</p>

            <p>We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</p>

            <p>In the study of non-adiabatic chemical processes such as photocatalysis and photosynthesis, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is an indispensable theoretical tool, which requires precise potential energy surfaces (PESs) of ground and excited states. Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry.</p>

            <h2>The Richness of Bell Nonlocality: Generalized Bell Polygamy and Hyper-Polygamy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerard Anglès Munné, Paweł Cieśliński, Jan Wójcik, Wiesław Laskowski</p>
            <p>Non-classical quantum correlations underpin both the foundations of quantum mechanics and modern quantum technologies. Among them, Bell nonlocality is a central example. For bipartite Bell inequalities, nonlocal correlations obey strict monogamy: a violation of one inequality precludes violations of other inequalities on the overlapping subsystems. In the multipartite setting, however, Bell nonlocality becomes inherently polygamous. This was previously shown for subsystems obtained by removing a single particle from an $N$-partite system. Here, we generalize this result to arbitrary $(N-k)$-partite subsystems with $k>0$. We demonstrate that a single $N$-qubit state can violate all $\binom{N}{k}$ relevant Bell inequalities simultaneously. We further construct an $N$-qubit Bell inequality, obtained by symmetrizing the $(N-k)$-qubit ones, that is maximally violated by states exhibiting this generalized polygamy. We compare these violations with those achievable by GHZ states and show that polygamy offers an advantage in multipartite scenarios, providing new insights into scalable certification of non-classicality in quantum devices. Our analysis relies on symmetry properties of the MABK inequalities. Finally, we show that this behavior can occur across multiple subsystem sizes, a phenomenon we call hyper-polygamy. These structures reveal the remarkable abundance of nonlocality present in multipartite quantum states and offer perspectives for their applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>In quantum science applications, ranging from many-body physics to quantum metrology, dipolar interactions in spin ensembles are controlled via Floquet engineering. However, this technique typically reduces the interaction strength between spins, and effectively weakens the coupling to a target sensing field, limiting the metrological sensitivity. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a method for direct tuning of the native interaction in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Our approach utilizes dressed-state qubit encoding under a magnetic field perpendicular to the crystal lattice orientation. This method leads to a $3.2\times$ enhancement of the dimensionless coherence parameter $JT_2$ compared to state-of-the-art Floquet engineering, and a $2.6\times$ ($8.3~$dB) enhanced sensitivity in AC magnetometry. Utilizing the extended coherence we experimentally probe spin transport at intermediate to late times. Our results provide a powerful Hamiltonian engineering tool for future studies with NV ensembles and other interacting higher-spin ($S>\frac{1}{2}$) systems.</p>

            <p>When an ensemble of quantum emitters interacts with a common radiation field, their emission becomes collective, giving rise to superradiant and subradiant states, characterized by broadened and narrowed linewidths. In this work, we propose to harness subradiant states for quantum metrology; such states naturally arise in subwavelength-spaced atomic arrays in free space and in small ensembles of emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides. We demonstrate that their collective optical response yields sharp, narrow features in the transmittance spectrum, which can be used to enhance sensitivity to external perturbations. This improved sensitivity can be applied to atomic clock operation, spatially resolved imaging of emitter positions, and enables precise detection of both global and spatially varying detunings (such as those induced by electromagnetic fields or gravitational gradients).</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Squeezing and Faster Metrology from Layered Quantum Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nickholas Gutierrez, Rodrigo Araiza Bravo, Susanne Yelin</p>
            <p>Spin squeezing is a powerful resource for quantum metrology, and recent hardware platforms based on interacting qubits provide multiple possible architectures to generate and reverse squeezing during a sensing protocol. In this work, we compare the sensing performance of three such architectures: quantum reservoir computers (QRCs), quantum perceptrons, and multi-layer quantum neural networks (QNNs), when used as squeezing-based field sensors. For all models, we consider a standard metrological sequence consisting of coherent-spin preparation, one-axis-twisting dynamics, field encoding via a weak rotation, time-reversal, and collective readout. We show that a single quantum perceptron generates the same optimal sensitivity as a QRC, but in the perturbative regime it benefits from accelerated squeezing due to steering by the output qubit. Stacking perceptrons into a QNN further amplifies this effect: in a 2-layer QNN with N_in input and N_out output qubits, the optimal squeezing time is reduced by a factor of N_out, while the achievable phase sensitivity remains Heisenberg-limited, Delta phi ~ 1/(N_in + N_out). Moreover, if the layers are used sequentially, first using the outputs to squeeze the inputs and then the inputs to squeeze the outputs, the two contributions to the response add constructively. This yields a sqrt(2) enhancement in sensitivity over a QRC when N_in = N_out and requires shorter total squeezing time. Generalizing to L layers, we show that the metrological gain scales as sqrt(L) while the required squeezing time decreases as 1/N_l, where N_l is the number of qubits per layer. Our results demonstrate that the structure of quantum neural networks can be exploited not only for computation, but also to engineer faster and more sensitive squeezing-based quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the interaction between a uniformly accelerated single qubit and a fermionic spinor field. Here we consider both the massless and the massive fermionic spinor fields. The qubit-field interaction occurs over a finite time and was evolved via perturbation theory. This approach yields the transition probability rates, from which we subsequently evaluate the quantum coherence of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector initially prepared in a qubit state. Our findings reveal that the UDW detector responds more when coupled with the fermionic field, and consequently, quantum coherence (for the fermionic case) degrades much more rapidly when compared to the case of the qubit linearly coupled with the scalar field. Moreover, the analysis suggests that particle mass plays a protective role against Unruh-induced decoherence as the rest mass energy becomes comparable to the detector's energy-level spacing, the detector's excitation probability and response decreases, which leads to the mitigation of quantum coherence degradation in accelerated quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehua Tian, Weiping Yao, Xiaobao Liu, Mengjie Wang, Jieci Wang, Jiliang Jing</p>
            <p>We theoretically propose an experimentally viable scheme to explore the transfer of nonclassical correlations from a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to a pair of impurities immersed in it. Operating at ultra-low temperature, density fluctuations of the dipolar BEC emulate a vacuum field with Lorentz-violating dispersion, while the two impurities function as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for the BEC quasiparticles. We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory.</p>

            <p>Uncertainty relations are fundamental to quantum mechanics, encoding limits on the simultaneous measurement of conjugate observables. Violations of joint uncertainty bounds can certify entanglement -- a resource critical for quantum information protocols and increasingly relevant in strong-field physics. Here, we investigate the pairwise time-delay and frequency-bandwidth uncertainties for arbitrary multimode quantum states of light, deriving a general lower bound for their joint product. We find that the nonclassical correction scales inversely with the average photon number, a behavior rooted in the so-called ``monogamy of entanglement''. These results clarify the intensity scaling of quantum advantages in nonclassical light states and highlight the interplay between entanglement and photon statistics.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points are singularities in the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in which several eigenvectors are linearly dependent and their eigenvalues are equal to each other. Usually it is assumed that the order of the exceptional point is limited by the number of degrees of freedom of a non-Hermitian system. In this letter, we refute this common opinion and show that non-Markovian effects can lead to dynamics characteristic of systems with exceptional points of higher orders than the number of degrees of freedom in the system. This takes place when the energy returns from reservoir to the system such that the dynamics of the system are divided into intervals in which it describes by the product of the exponential and a polynomial function of ever-increasing order. We demonstrate that by choosing the observation time, it is possible to observe exceptional points of arbitrary high orders.</p>

As an example we study a superconducting transmon qubit interacting with a microwave cavity, which is one of such systems and is, furthermore, essential in the context of quantum information processing. We propose suitable Hamiltonian parameters for the preparation and measurement phases of the detection scheme that allow for an experimental test, and verify that the reported signal is nonnegligibly large still at finite temperatures.</p>

Further, we analyse the security of our protocol against collective attack and establish reduced resource requirement for the same length of the raw key compared to the previous protocol. Finally, we show that our protocol remains robust even in a noisy environment.</p>

            <p>Photon subtraction and addition are essential non-Gaussian processes in quantum optics, where conventional methods using linear optics and number-resolving detection often suffer from low success probability. Here, we introduce the concept of \textit{dynamic stimulated emission}, whereby a quantum emitter undergoes stimulated emission with a time-dependent coupling. We show that, for both two- and three-level emitters, this process can be used to deterministically add or subtract a photon to a single propagating optical mode. We provide semi-analytic solutions to this problem for Fock states, enabling deterministic and unconditional single-photon subtraction and addition with fidelity ${\cal F}>0.996$. Our semi-analytic solutions are provided for both dynamically coupled two-level systems and for three-level systems whose dynamical coupling is controlled by a coherent laser drive. Moving beyond individual Fock states, we further showcase the ability to subtract and add single photons to photon-number superposition states. We show that Schrödinger cat states can be prepared from squeezed vacuum input via cascaded subtraction or cascaded addition. Finally, we show that our photon-addition process can be used to add a photon to any squeezed and displaced state with high success probability and fidelity ${\cal F}>0.99$, thereby potentially converting quantum emitters from single-photon sources to sources of single-photon-added Gaussian states without the need for inline squeezing. Our protocols provide a path towards integrating quantum emitters to construct efficient sources of single-mode non-Gaussian light beyond single photons.</p>

            <p>We propose a single auxiliary-assisted purification-based framework for quantum error correction, capable of correcting errors that drive a system from its ground-state subspace into excited-state sectors. The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle.</p>

Moreover, we introduce an optimization approach, formulated as a semidefinite program, that systematically searches for those witnesses best suited to reveal entanglement under the given measurement constraints. We demonstrate the practicality of the approach in a proof-of-principle experiment with photon-polarization qubits, where entanglement is certified using only a fraction of the full measurement data.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyuan Zhou, Shaun Pexton, Aleksander Kubica, Yongshan Ding</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is typically viewed as a suite of practical techniques for today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, with limited relevance once fault-tolerant quantum computers become available. In this work, we challenge this conventional wisdom by showing that QEM can continue to provide substantial benefits in the era of quantum error correction (QEC), and in an even more efficient manner than it does on current devices. We introduce a framework for logical-level QEM that leverages soft information naturally produced by QEC decoders, requiring no additional data, hardware modifications, or runtime overhead beyond what QEC protocols already provide. Within this framework, we develop and analyze three logical-level QEM techniques: post-selection and runtime abort policies, probabilistic error cancellation, and zero-noise extrapolation. Our techniques reduce logical error rates by more than 100x while discarding fewer than 0.1% of shots; they also provide in situ characterization of logical channels for QEM protocols. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our approach using a surface-code architecture and two state-of-the-art decoders based on tensor-network contraction and minimum-weight perfect matching. We evaluate logical-level QEM on random Clifford circuits and molecular simulation algorithms and find that, compared to previous approaches relying on QEC only or QEC combined with QEM, we can achieve up to 87.4% spacetime overhead savings. Our results demonstrate that logical-level QEM with QEC decoder soft information can reliably improve logical performance, underscoring the efficiency and usefulness of QEM techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Building large-scale quantum communication networks has its unique challenges. Here, we demonstrate that a network-wide synergistic usage of quantum memories distributed in a quantum communication network offers a fundamental advantage. We first map the problem of quantum communication with local usage of memories into a classical continuum percolation model. Then, we show that this mapping can be improved through a cooperation of quantum distillation and relay protocols via remote access to distributed memories. This improved mapping, which we term $\alpha$-percolation, can be formulated in terms of graph-merging rules, analogous to the decimation rules of the renormalization group treatment of disordered quantum magnets. These rules can be performed in any order, yielding the same optimal result that is characterized by the emergence of a ``positive feedback'' mechanism and the formation of spatially disconnected ``hopping'' communication components -- both marking significant improvements beyond the traditional point-to-point consideration of quantum communication in networked structures.</p>

On the other hand, the maximal slice states always violate the Svetlichny inequality when $n-$tangle is nonzero, and the violation increases monotonically with tangle.

            <p>Implementing the time evolution under a desired target Hamiltonian is critical for various applications in quantum science. Due to the exponential increase in the number of parameters with system size and experimental imperfections, this task can be challenging in quantum many-body settings. We introduce an efficient and robust scheme to engineer arbitrary local many-body Hamiltonians. To this end, our scheme applies single-qubit $\pi$ or $\pi/2$ pulses to an always-on system Hamiltonian, which we assume to be native to a given platform. These sequences are constructed by efficiently solving a linear program (LP) which minimizes the total evolution time. In this way, we can engineer target Hamiltonians that are only limited by the locality of the interactions in the system Hamiltonian. Based on average Hamiltonian theory and using robust composite pulses, we make our schemes robust against errors, including finite pulse time errors and various control errors. To demonstrate the performance of our scheme, we provide numerical simulations. In particular, we solve the Hamiltonian engineering problem on a laptop for arbitrary two-local Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice with $196$ qubits in only $60$ seconds. Moreover, we simulate the engineering of general Heisenberg Hamiltonians from Ising Hamiltonians using imperfect single-qubit pulses for smaller system sizes and achieve a fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$, which is orders of magnitude better than non-robust implementations.</p>

            <h2>Higher-Order Adiabatic Elimination in Atom-Cavity Systems and Its Impact on Spin-Squeezing Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Giaccari, Giulia Dellea, Marco G. Genoni, Gianluca Bertaina</p>
            <p>Spin-squeezed states are metrologically useful quantum states where entanglement allows for enhanced sensing with respect to the standard quantum limit. Key challenges include the efficient preparation of spin-squeezed states and the scalability of estimation precision with the number $N$ of probes. Recently, in the context of the generation of spin-squeezed states via coupling of three-level atoms to an optical cavity, it was shown that increasing the atom-cavity coupling can be detrimental to spin squeezing generation, an effect that is not captured by the standard second-order adiabatic cavity removal approximation. We describe adiabatic elimination techniques to derive an effective Lindblad master equation up to third order for the atomic degrees of freedom. Numerical simulations show that the spin squeezing scalability loss is correctly reproduced by the reduced open system dynamics, highlighting the role of higher-order contributions. Furthermore, we conjecture an extension beyond leading order of the adiabatic elimination technique to the case of conditional dynamics under quantum non-demolition continuous measurement and fast cavity loss, whose reliability is again confirmed by numerical simulation of the dynamics and the corresponding behavior of spin squeezing as a function of $N$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jierui Hu, Hao Yuan, Joshua Akin, Shanhui Fan, Kejie Fang</p>
            <p>Breaking optical reciprocity enables new regimes of light--matter interaction with broad implications for fundamental physics and emerging quantum technologies. Although various approaches have been explored to achieve optical nonreciprocity, realizing it at the single-photon level has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate nonmagnetic optical nonreciprocity -- including both isolation and circulation -- in the quantum regime, enabled by efficient and noiseless all-optical frequency conversion on an integrated III-V photonic chip. Our device preserves the quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons while delivering exceptional performance parameters, including a high extinction ratio of 34 dB, low insertion loss of 0.8 dB, broad bandwidth of 44 GHz, high operational fidelity of 97%, and widely tunable operation wavelength. This realization of quantum optical nonreciprocity in a scalable photonic platform opens a pathway toward directional quantum communication and noise-resilient quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum catalysis-enhanced extract energy in qubit quantum battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shun-Cai Zhao</p>
            <p>What physical mechanism enables quantum catalysis to boost quantum battery (QB) performance in open systems? We investigate an external-field-driven qubit QB coupled to a harmonic oscillator catalyst, revealing a key thermodynamic mechanism: the catalyst induces transient negative heat flow ($J(t)<0$, or energy backflow) into the battery. This backflow actively counters dephasing losses, rapidly pushing the qubit into non-passive states, and results in a drastic enhancement of extractable work (Ergotropy). Leveraging the quantum first law, we precisely quantify this causal link between negative heat flux and QB performance enhancement. Our work uncovers the fundamental role of transient thermodynamic backflow in quantum catalysis, offering a crucial blueprint for high-performance quantum energy storage devices.</p>

            <h2>Exchange Symmetry in Multiphoton Quantum Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreya Kumar, Alex E Jones, Daniel Bhatti, Stefanie Barz</p>
            <p>Photons are bosons, and yet, when prepared in specific entangled states, they can exhibit non-bosonic behaviour. While this phenomenon has so far been studied in two-photon systems, exchange symmetries and interference effects in multi-photon scenarios remain largely unexplored. In this work, we show that multi-photon states uncover a rich landscape of exchange symmetries. With three photons already, multiple pairwise combinations are possible, where each pair of photons can exhibit either bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic exchange symmetry. This gives rise to mixed symmetry systems that are not possible to achieve with two photon alone. We experimentally investigate how these symmetry configurations manifest themselves in the observed interference of three photons. We show that multi-photon interference can be effectively turned on and off by tuning the symmetry of the constituent pairs. The possibility of accessing and tuning new quantum statistics in a scalable photonic platform not only deepens our understanding of quantum systems, but is also highly relevant for quantum technologies that rely on quantum interference.</p>

            <h2>Coherence-limited digital control of a superconducting qubit using a Josephson pulse generator at 3 K</h2>

            <p>Compared to traditional semiconductor control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, cryogenic single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics can provide qubit measurement and control alternatives that address critical issues related to scalability of cryogenic quantum processors. Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-and Feedback-Driven Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions on a Quantum Processor</h2>

            <p>Mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes are essential for implementing quantum error-correction on quantum hardware. When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter. Our results demonstrate that adaptive quantum circuits provide a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ángel E. Reyna-Cruz, Julio C. Gutiérrez-Vega</p>
            <p>We present a classical and quantum analysis of a particle confined in a three-dimensional paraboloidal cavity formed by two confocal paraboloids. Classically, the system is integrable and presents three independent constants of motion, namely, the energy, the $z$-component of the angular momentum, and a third dynamical constant associated with the paraboloidal geometry, which can be derived from the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schrödinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations. A direct correspondence between classical trajectories and quantum eigenstates reveals that probability densities concentrate in the classically allowed region with controlled penetration into forbidden zones.</p>

            <p>Controlled quantum mechanical motion of trapped atomic ions can be used to simulate and explore collective quantum phenomena and to process quantum information. Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into "Coulomb crystals" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion. The motion of the ions in these crystals is strongly coupled, and the eigenmodes of motion all involve multiple ions. While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $\mu$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects.</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art superconducting qubits rely on a limited set of thin-film materials. Expanding their materials palette can improve performance, extend operating regimes, and introduce new functionalities, but conventional thin-film fabrication hinders systematic exploration of new material combinations. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a highly modular crystalline platform that facilitates such exploration while enabling gate-tunability, higher-temperature operation, and compact qubit geometries. Yet it remains unknown whether a fully vdW superconducting qubit can support quantum coherence and what mechanisms dominate loss at both low and elevated temperatures in such a device. Here we demonstrate quantum-coherent merged-element transmons made entirely from vdW Josephson junctions. These first-generation, fully crystalline qubits achieve microsecond lifetimes in an ultra-compact footprint without external shunt capacitors. Energy relaxation measurements, together with microwave characterization of vdW capacitors, point to dielectric loss as the dominant relaxation channel up to hundreds of millikelvin. These results establish vdW materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Time, space and entanglement are the main characters in this work. Their nature is still a great mystery in physics and we study here the possibility that these three phenomena are closely connected, showing how entanglement can be at the basis of the emergence of time and space within closed quantum systems. We revisit and extend the Page and Wootters theory that was originally introduced in order to describe the emergence of time through entanglement between subsystems in a globally static, quantum Universe. In the book, after providing a complete review of the salient aspects of the theory, we establish a connection with recent research on the foundations of statistical mechanics and we propose a new understanding of the thermalization process. Furthermore, we generalize the framework in order describe the spatial degree of freedom and we provide a model of 3+1 dimensional, quantum spacetime emerging from entanglement among different subsystems in a globally "timeless" and "positionless" Universe. Finally, via the Page and Wootters theory, the evolution of quantum clocks within a gravitational field is treated and a time dilation effect is obtained in agreement with the Schwarzschild solution.</p>

            <p>Quantum communication between remote chips is essential for realizing large-scale superconducting quantum computers. For such communication, itinerant microwave photons propagating through transmission lines offer a promising approach. However, demonstrations to date have relied on frequency-tunable circuit elements to compensate for fabrication-related parameter variations between sender and receiver devices, introducing control complexity and limiting scalability. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips. To compensate for the sender-receiver mismatch, we employ a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique which enables us to adjust the photon frequency without modifying circuit parameters. To enhance the frequency tunability, we implement broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators, achieving a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz. This broadband design enables successful quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies between the remote qubits. Quantum process tomography reveals state transfer fidelities of around 78% and Bell-state fidelities of around 73% across the full frequency range. Our approach avoids the complexity of the control lines and noise channels, providing a flexible pathway toward scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <p>The original boson sampling paradigm-consisting of multiple single-photon input states, a large interferometer, and multi-channel click detection-was originally proposed as a photonic route to quantum computational advantage. Its non-Gaussian resources, essential for outperforming any classical system, are provided by single-photon inputs and click detection. Yet the drive toward larger experiments has led to the replacement of experimentally demanding single-photon sources with Gaussian states, thereby diminishing the available non-Gaussianity-a critical quantum resource. As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states. To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run. This architecture enables direct, side-by-side benchmarking of distinct sampling regimes under otherwise identical conditions. By employing a semi-device-independent framework, offering certification that does not rely on prior knowledge of the interferometer or the input states, we verify that the observed data cannot be reproduced by any classical model-a prerequisite for demonstrating quantum advantage. Applying this framework, we observe clear performance gains arising from non-Gaussian input states.</p>

            <p>We investigate magnomechanically induced transparency in a parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanical system with traveling-field-induced non-Hermiticity. The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing.</p>

Here we overcome these limitations by combining a microresonator with an engineered mode spectrum and optimized pump conditions. We realize a CV quantum microcomb comprising 14 independent two-mode squeezed states, each exhibiting more than 4 dB of raw squeezing (up to 4.3 dB) across a 0.7 THz bandwidth. This uniform, high-performance quantum resource represents a key step toward scalable, integrated CV quantum technologies operating beyond classical limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kashif Ammar Yasir, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Lee-Yang theory offers a unifying framework for understanding classical phase transitions and dynamical quantum phase transitions through the analysis of partition functions and Loschmidt echoes. Recently, this framework is extended to characterize quantum phase transitions in arXiv:2509.20258 by introducing the concepts of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros. Here, we generalize the theory by studying a broad class of quantum models, including the XY model, the XXZ model, the XYZ model, and the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model in one dimension, subject to complex external magnetic field. For the XY, XXZ and XYZ models, we find that the complex field breaks parity symmetry and induces oscillations of the ground state between the two parity sectors, giving rise to fidelity zeros within the ordered phases. For the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, the complex field splits the real part of the ground-state energy between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sectors ($q=1,2$), while preserving the degeneracy within the charged sector. Fidelity zeros arise only after projecting out one of the charged sectors, and the finite-size scaling of these zeros produces critical exponents fully consistent with analytical predictions.</p>

The second arises when the injection of multi-charged vortices leads to the formation of a dispersive shock wave which acts as a continuous source of phase slippage.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastián Franchino-Viñas, Jérémie Quevillon, Diego Saviot</p>
            <p>Building upon the Covariant Derivative Expansion, we develop a method to compute effective actions that is able to capture non-perturbative effects induced by strong background fields. We demonstrate the method in scalar QED, by deriving the full second-derivative corrections to the scalar Heisenberg--Euler effective action. The corresponding result is interpreted as an effective field theory with three characteristic scales, two of which are large (mass and field strength) in comparison with the remaining one (derivatives of the field). As an application, we show that, at this order, the transseries structure of the Schwinger pair production rate is preserved, even if the involved coefficients are modified. Our analysis also helps clarify recent disagreements concerning the coefficients of this effective action.</p>

            <h2>Moire-Engineered Ferroelectric Transistors for Nearly Trap-free, Low-Power and Non-Volatile 2D Electronics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arup Singha, Shaili Sett, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Arindam Ghosh, Rahul Debnath</p>
            <p>Long-range moire patterns in twisted WSe2 enable a built-in, moire-length-scale ferroelectric polarization that can be directly harnessed in electronic devices. Such a built-in ferroic landscape offers a compelling means to enable ultralow-voltage and non-volatile electronic functionality in two-dimensional materials; however, achieving stable polarization control without charge trapping has remained a persistent challenge. Here, we demonstrate a moire-engineered ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) utilizing twisted WSe2 bilayers that leverages atomically clean van der Waals interfaces to achieve efficient polarization-channel coupling and trap-suppressed, ultralow-voltage operation (subthreshold swing of 64 mV per decade). The device exhibits a stable non-volatile memory window of 0.10 V and high mobility, exceeding the performance of previously reported two-dimensional FeFET and matching that of advanced silicon-based devices. In addition, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy, corroborated by self-consistent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire modeling, indicates ultrafast ferroelectric switching (~0.5 microseconds). These results establish moire-engineered ferroelectricity as a practical and scalable route toward ultraclean, low-power, and non-volatile 2D electronics, bridging atomistic lattice engineering with functional device architectures for next-generation memory and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Ab initio study of highly charged ion-induced Coulomb explosion imaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Misa Viveiros, Samuel S. Taylor, Cody Covington, Kálmán Varga</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of ion-induced Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) of pyridazine molecules driven by energetic C$^{5+}$ projectiles, using time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) with Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics. By systematically varying the projectile's impact point and orientation relative to the molecular plane, we compare orthogonal and in-plane trajectories and quantify their effects on fragment momenta, electron-density response, and atom-resolved ionization. Newton plots and time-resolved density snapshots show that trajectories avoiding direct atomic collisions yield the most faithful structural reconstructions, whereas direct impacts impart large, highly localized momenta that distort the recovered geometry. Planar trajectories generate substantially greater ionization and broader momentum distributions than orthogonal ones due to deeper traversal through the molecular electron cloud. Quantitative analysis of electron removal at 10~fs confirms that projectile proximity and orientation strongly modulate both local and global ionization. These findings clarify how impact geometry governs the fidelity of ion-induced CEI structural recovery and help explain the variability and noise observed in experimental CEI measurements. More broadly, the results highlight both the strengths and the intrinsic limitations of ion-induced CEI and identify key considerations for interpreting experiments.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigated the readout process of a spin--qubit structure based on a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor. Our study focuses on a logical qubit composed of two physical qubits. Different spin configurations result in different charge distributions, which subsequently influence the electrostatic effects on the GAA transistor. Consequently, the current flowing through the GAA transistor depends on the qubit's state. We calculated the current-voltage characteristics of the three-dimensional configurations of the qubit and GAA structures, using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Moreover, we performed circuit simulations using the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) to investigate whether a readout circuit made from complementary metal--oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can amplify the weak signals generated by the qubits. Our findings indicate that, by dynamically controlling the applied voltage within a properly designed circuit, the readout can be detected effectively based on a conventional sense amplifier.</p>

            <h2>Operator Lanczos Approach enabling Neural Quantum States as Real-Frequency Impurity Solvers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas B. Rigo, Markus Schmitt</p>
            <p>To understand the intricate exchange between electrons of different bands in strongly correlated materials, it is essential to treat multi-orbital models accurately. For this purpose, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides an established framework, whose scope crucially hinges on the availability of efficient quantum impurity solvers. Here we present a real-frequency impurity solver based on neural quantum states (NQS) combined with an operator-Lanczos construction. NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction. Our benchmarks on both the single-orbital Anderson model and the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori impurity Hamiltonian reveal excellent ground-state precision and the capacity to accurately resolve zero temperature spectral functions and self-energies. These results open avenues for extending DMFT to more challenging problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. E. Bikbaev, M. Yu. Khlopov, A. G. Mayorov</p>
            <p>The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms offers a compelling framework to address the challenges in direct dark matter particles detection, as their neutral, atom-like configuration evades conventional experimental signatures. A critical issue may arise in interaction between $XHe$ and atomic nuclei due to the unshielded nuclear attraction, which could destabilize the dark atom's bound state. To resolve this, we propose a novel numerical quantum mechanical approach that accounts for self-consistent electromagnetic-nuclear couplings. This method addresses to eliminate the inherent complexity of the $XHe$-nucleus three-body system, where analytical solutions are intractable. By reconstructing the effective interaction potential - including dipole Coulomb barrier and shallow potential well - we demonstrate how these features lead to the formation of $XHe$-nucleus bound states and modulate low-energy capture processes. Our model enables validation of the dark atom hypothesis, particularly in interpreting experimental anomalies like annual modulation signals observed in DAMA/LIBRA. These findings advance the theoretical foundation for dark matter interactions and provide a robust framework for future experimental design.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</p>

            <p>Two-photon interference, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, has colossal implications for quantum technology. It was observed in 1987 with two photodetectors monitoring outputs of the beamsplitter illuminated by photon pairs: the coincidence rate of the detectors drops to zero when detected photons overlap in time. More broadly, bosons (e.g., photons) coalesce while fermions (e.g., electrons) anti-coalesce when interfering on a lossless beamsplitter. Quantum interference of bosons and fermions can be tested in a single - photonics platform, where bosonic and fermionic states are artificially created as pairs of entangled photons with symmetric and anti-symmetric spatial wavefunctions. We observed that interference on a lossy beamsplitter, or a subwavelength coherent absorber reverses quantum interference in such a way that bosonic states anti-coalesce while fermionic states exhibit coalescent-like behavior. The ability to generate states of light with different statistics and manipulate their interference offers important opportunities for quantum information and metrology.</p>

            <h2>An Appropriate Probability Model for the Bell Experiment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kees van Hee, Kees van Berkel, Jan de Graaf</p>
            <p>The Bell inequality constrains the outcomes of measurements on pairs of distant entangled particles. The Bell contradiction states that the Bell inequality is inconsistent with the calculated outcomes of these quantum experiments. This contradiction led many to question the underlying assumptions, viz. so-called realism and locality. The probability model underlying the Bell inequality is generally left implicit. This implicit consensus model assumes four simultaneously observable detector settings. The Bell contradiction follows from this assumption. We propose an explicit probability model for the CHSH version of the Bell experiment. This model has only two simultaneously observable detector settings per measurement, and therefore does not assume realism. The quantum expectation now becomes a conditional expectation, given the two detector settings. This probability model is in full agreement with both quantum mechanics and experiments. In this model the notion of Bell contradiction has no meaning. Furthermore, the proposed probability model is statistically local, and is not Bell-separable. The latter implies that either hidden variables must be ruled out, or that locality must be violated, in agreement with Bell's conclusion.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uta Isabella Meyer, Ivan Šupić, Frédéric Grosshans, Damian Markham</p>
            <p>Self-testing identifies quantum states and correlations that exhibit nonlocality, distinguishing them, up to local transformations, from other quantum states. Due to their strong nonlocality, it is known that all graph states can be self-tested in the standard setting - where parties are not allowed to communicate. Recently it has been shown that graph states display nonlocal correlations even when bounded classical communication on the underlying graph is permitted, a feature that has found applications in proving a circuit-depth separation between classical and quantum computing. In this work, we develop self testing in the framework of bounded classical communication, and we show that certain graph states can be robustly self-tested even allowing for communication. In particular, we provide an explicit self-test for the circular graph state and the honeycomb cluster state - the latter known to be a universal resource for measurement based quantum computation. Since communication generally obstructs self-testing of graph states, we further provide a procedure to robustly self-test any graph state from larger ones that exhibit nonlocal correlations in the communication scenario.</p>

            <p>We present a sensing scheme for estimating the frequency difference of two non-entangled photons. The technique consists of time-resolving sampling measurements at the output of a beam splitter. With this protocol, the frequency shift between two photons can be estimated with the ultimate precision achievable in nature, overcoming the limits in precision and the range of detection of frequency-resolving detectors employed in standard direct measurements of the frequencies. The sensitivity can be increased by increasing the coherence time of the photons. We show that, already with $\sim 1000$ sampling measurements, the Cramér-Rao bound is saturated independently of the value of the difference in frequency.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer Rényi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Glassiness From Efficient Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
            <p>We show a relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We use the existence of efficient, local learning algorithms for energy estimation -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- to prove that finding near-ground states of disordered quantum systems exhibiting a certain topological property is impossible in the average case for Lipschitz quantum algorithms. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including time-$T$ Lindbladian dynamics from an arbitrary initial state, time-$T$ quantum annealing, phase estimation to $T$ bits of precision, and depth-$T$ variational quantum algorithms, whenever $T$ is less than some universal constant times the logarithm of the system size. To achieve this, we introduce a generalization of the overlap gap property (OGP) for quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). We prove that preparing low-energy states of systems which exhibit the QOGP is intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations of their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charlotte Bäcker, Valentin Link, Walter T. Strunz</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of memory effects in the non-Markovian dynamics of spin boson models. Local quantum memory criteria can be used to indicate that the reduced dynamics of an open system necessarily requires a quantum memory in its environment. We apply two such criteria, derived from different definitions put forward in the literature, to spin boson and two-spin boson models. For the computation of dynamical maps and process tensors, we employ a numerically exact method for non-Markovian open system dynamics based on matrix product operator influence functionals, that can be applied across broad parameter regimes. We find that, with access to single-intervention process tensors, one can generally predict quantum memory in the dynamics at low temperatures. Given instead only the dynamical map, we are still able to detect quantum memory in the case of resonant environments at short evolution times. Moreover, we confirm quantum memory in the stationary dynamical regime using process tensors with the correlated steady state of system and environment as initial condition.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Phase-Insensitive Force Sensing with Non-Gaussian States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piotr T. Grochowski, Radim Filip</p>
            <p>Quantum metrology enables sensitivity to approach the limits set by fundamental physical laws. Even a single continuous mode offers enhanced precision, with the improvement scaling with its occupation number. Due to their high information capacity, continuous modes allow for the engineering of quantum non-Gaussian states, which not only improve metrological performance but can also be tailored to specific experimental platforms and conditions. Recent advancements in control over continuous platforms operating in the quantum regime have renewed interest in sensing weak forces, also coupling to massive macroscopic objects. In this work, we investigate a force-sensing scheme where a physical process completely randomizes the direction of the induced phase-space displacement, and the unknown force strength is inferred through excitation-number-resolving measurements. We find that $N$-spaced states, where only every $N^{\text{th}}$ Fock state occupation is nonzero, approach the achievable sensing bound. Additionally, non-Gaussian states are shown to be more resilient against decoherence than their Gaussian counterparts with the same occupation number. While Fock states typically offer the best protection against decoherence, we uncover a transition in the metrological landscape -- revealed through a tailored decoherence-aware Fisher-information-based reward functional -- where experimental constraints favor a family of number-squeezed Schrödinger cat states. Specifically, by implementing quantum optimal control in a minimal spin-boson system, we identify these states as maximizing force sensitivity under lossy dynamics and finite system controllability. Our results provide a pathway for enhancing force sensing in a variety of continuous quantum systems, ranging from massive systems like mechanical oscillators to massless systems such as quantum light and microwave resonators.</p>

            <p>Feedback control in open quantum dynamics is crucial for the advancement of various coherent platforms. However, currently only a handful of feedback master equations exist in the literature, which are restricted to specific types of feedback. In this letter we first introduce a unifying framework, based on a single general equation, that describes all possible feedback schemes in sequentially (and continuously) measured systems, and from which all previous results follow. Next, we specialize it to the case of quantum jumps and introduce a new type of feedback based on the channel of the last detected jump, as well as the time elapsed since it occurred. Our description is experimentally grounded, and naturally allows for the introduction of realistic effects, such as time-delays in the feedback loop. We illustrate our results with two time-dependent feedback protocols conditioned on quantum-jump detections: one achieving population inversion of a two-level system against a thermal bath, and another enabling real-time reversal of quantum transitions, both admitting steady-state solutions.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</p>

Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Jamadagni, Eugene Dumitrescu</p>
            <p>Locally Purified Density Operators (LPDOs) are state-of-the-art tensor network ansatze candidates that efficiently represent mixed quantum states at scale. However, given their non-uniqueness, their representational complexity is generally sub-optimal in practical computations. In this work we perform a comprehensive numerical and analytical analysis and resolve this issue in the experimentally relevant limit where noise depolarizes the density operator into a maximally mixed state. To resolve the sub-optimality issue, we analyze two numerical tools, one analytic method, and detail the relations between them. The numerical tools used are fidelity-preserving truncations and isometric gauge transformations leveraging Riemannian optimizations over entropic objective functions. In addition, by invoking the injectivity and symmetry constraints of the maximally mixed LPDO, we also present analytical closed-form expressions for the disentangler and discuss their relation to numerical optimizers. Our work shows how, by minimizing the resources required to represent key states of practical interest in experiment, the efficiency of tensor network algorithms can be substantially increased. This paves the path for uncovering tensor network's fundamental scalability limits and latent potential in representing the wide locus of mixed quantum states that are accessible on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise. Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$ algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$, $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick Strocka, Mohamed Belhassen, Tim Schröder, Gregor Pieplow</p>
            <p>In the rapidly evolving field of quantum technology, the precise and detailed description of quantum components is not just a necessity but the foundation for advancing research, development, and applications. Optically accessible quantum memories are key building blocks for devices such as quantum repeaters and two-factor authentication. The memory we describe here is based on a tin-vacancy color center coupled to a highly efficient cavity. It leverages state-dependent reflection from the cavity and implements high-fidelity fractional single qubit gates via a train of optical $\pi/8$ pulses. We also describe its operation under microwave control, further extending our analysis. Our primary contribution in this work is the integration of this device model into a standardized software framework for quantum memory architectures.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Hoeffding and Chernoff: Trading conclusiveness for advantages in quantum hypothesis testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Ji, Bartosz Regula</p>
            <p>The ultimate limits of quantum state discrimination are often thought to be captured by asymptotic bounds that restrict the achievable error probabilities, notably the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. Here we study hypothesis testing protocols that are permitted a probability of producing an inconclusive discrimination outcome, and investigate their performance when this probability is suitably constrained. We show that even by allowing an arbitrarily small probability of inconclusiveness, the limits imposed by the quantum Hoeffding and Chernoff bounds can be significantly exceeded. This completely circumvents the conventional trade-offs between error exponents in hypothesis testing while incurring only a vanishingly small overhead over conventional approaches. Such improvements over standard state discrimination are robust and can be obtained even when an exponentially vanishing probability of inconclusive outcomes is demanded. Relaxing the constraints on the inconclusive probability can enable even larger advantages, but this comes at a price. We show a 'strong converse' property of this setting: targeting error exponents beyond those achievable with vanishing inconclusiveness necessarily forces the probability of inconclusive outcomes to converge to one. By exactly quantifying the rate of this convergence, we give a complete characterisation of the trade-offs between error exponents and rates of conclusive outcome probabilities. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive asymptotic picture of how the allowance for inconclusive measurement outcomes reshapes optimal quantum hypothesis testing.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-Based Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation on High-Connectivity Devices: A Resource-Efficient Approach toward Early FTQC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yohei Ibe, Yutaka Hirano, Yasuo Ozu, Toru Kawakubo, Keisuke Fujii</p>
            <p>We propose a measurement-based FTQC (MB-FTQC) architecture for high-connectivity platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms. The key idea is to use verified logical ancillas combined with Knill's error-correcting teleportation, eliminating repeated syndrome measurements and simplifying decoding to logical Pauli corrections, thus keeping classical overhead low. To align with near-term device scales, we present two implementations benchmarked under circuit-level depolarizing noise: (i) a Steane-code version that uses analog $R_Z(\theta)$ rotations, akin to the STAR architecture [Akahoshi et al., PRX Quantum 5, 010337], aiming for the megaquop regime ($\sim 10^6$ $T$ gates) on devices with thousands of qubits; and (ii) a Golay-code version with higher-order zero-level magic-state distillation, targeting the gigaquop regime ($\sim 10^9$ $T$ gates) on devices with tens of thousands of qubits. At a physical error rate $p=10^{-4}$, the Steane path supports $5\times 10^{4}$ logical $R_Z(\theta)$ rotations, corresponding to $\sim 2.4\times 10^{6}$ $T$ gates and enabling megaquop-scale computation. With about $2{,}240$ physical qubits, it achieves $\log_{2}\mathrm{QV}=64$. The Golay path supports more than $2\times 10^{9}$ $T$ gates, enabling gigaquop-scale computation. These results suggest that our architecture can deliver practical large-scale quantum computation on near-term high-connectivity hardware without relying on resource-intensive surface codes or complex code concatenation.</p>

            <p>Quantum heuristics offer a potential advantage for combinatorial optimization but are constrained by near-term hardware limitations. We introduce Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE) algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Optimal transfer of entanglement in oscillator chains in non-Markovian open systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Wei Luo, Edward Yu, Ting Yu</p>
            <p>We considered the transfer of continuous-variable entangled states in coupled oscillator chains embedded in a generic environment. We demonstrate high-fidelity transfer via optimal control in two configurations - a linear chain and an X-shaped chain. More specifically, we use the Krotov optimization algorithm to design control fields that achieve the desired state transfer. Under the environmental memory effects, the Krotov algorithm needs to be modified, since the dissipative terms in non-Markovian dynamics are generally governed by the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. Remarkably, we can achieve high-fidelity transfer by simply tuning the frequencies of the oscillators while keeping the coupling strength constant, even in the presence of open-system effects. For the system under consideration, we find that quantum memory effects can aid in the transfer of entanglement and show improvement over the memoryless case. In addition, it is possible to target a range of entangled states, making it unnecessary to know the parameters of the initial state beforehand.</p>

            <h2>Annual-modulation fingerprint of the axion wind induced sideband triplet in quantum dot spin qubit sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Tan, Zhanning Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Luo, Zhihua Guo, Fanxu Meng, Chen-Ming Bai</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement is regarded as a crucial physical resource in quantum network communication. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of quantum many-body systems, identifying a multipartite entanglement measure that is both efficiently computable and capable of accurately characterizing entanglement remains a challenging problem. To address these issues, we propose a family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures for mixed states, termed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements. Many well-known multipartite entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of this family of measures, such as the entanglement of formation and the concentratable entanglements introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 140501 (2021)]. We demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements constitutes a well-defined entanglement monotones, and establish several desirable properties it satisfies, such as subadditivity and continuity. We further investigate the ordering relations of unified-entropy concentratable entanglements and discuss how these quantities can be efficiently estimated on near-term quantum devices. As an application, we demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements can effectively distinguish between multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states. The ordering relations of these entanglement measures are further validated using four-partite star quantum network states and four-qubit Dicke states. Moreover, we find that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements exhibit greater sensitivity than the original concentratable entanglements in detecting certain four-partite star quantum network states.</p>

            <p>Quantum memory plays a critical role in quantum communication, sensing, and computation. However, studies on quantum memory under a unified benchmarking framework remain scarce. In this paper, we propose a weight-based quantifier as a benchmarking method to evaluate the performance advantage of quantum memory in nonlocal exclusion tasks. We establish a general lower bound for the weight-based measure of quantum memory. Moreover, this measure provides fundamental theoretical bounds for transforming a general channel into an ideal quantum memory. Finally, we present explicit calculations of the weight-based quantifier for various channels, including unitary channels, depolarizing channels, maximal replacement channels, stochastic damping channels, and erasure channels.</p>

            <h2>Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fumin Wang</p>
            <p>Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) promises superpolynomial speedups for structured optimization; however, its practical realization is often hindered by significant sensitivity to hardware noise and spectral dispersion. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI), a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $\Sigma_K$, and prove a Monotonic Improvement Theorem, which establishes that maximizing $\Sigma_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damian Rovara, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Qubit reuse offers a promising way to reduce the hardware demands of quantum circuits, but current approaches are largely restricted to reordering measurements and applying qubit resets. In this work, we present an approach to further optimize quantum circuits by fully utilizing the potential of dynamic quantum circuits-more precisely by moving measurements and introducing dynamic circuit primitives such as classically controlled gates in a way that forges entirely new pathways for qubit reuse. This significantly reduces the number of required qubits for a variety of circuits, creating new opportunities for running complex circuits on near-term devices with limited qubit counts. We show that the proposed approach drastically outperforms existing methods, reducing qubit requirements where previous approaches are unable to do so for popular quantum circuits such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Fourier Transform~(QFT), and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ansätze, as well as leading to improvements of up to 95% for sparse random circuits.</p>

            <p>The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.</p>

            <h2>A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyao Li, Marc Illa, Martin J. Savage</p>
            <p>Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Correlation Assisted Cooling of Microwave Cavities Below the Ambient Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daryoosh Vashaee, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have established and rigorously validated a modified Langevin noise formalism that enables first-principles quantization of electromagnetic fields in open and dissipative environments [1,2,3].

In this work, we explore the potential of this formalism for nanophotonic applications by modeling representative quantum-plasmonic dynamics. In particular, we present detailed numerical examples for (i) two-photon interference mediated by a quantum plasmonic beam splitter, and (ii) non-Markovian dynamics of an atom located in plasmonic antennas and directional control of out-coupled single-photon fields. These results demonstrate that the proposed modeling approach can be directly used to guide the design and optimization of plasmonic single-photon sources and beam-splitting structures. Moreover, the framework is broadly applicable to the analysis of linear optical components and cavity quantum electrodynamics problems in open and dissipative photonic integrated circuits.</p>

By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a fourfold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground-state degeneracies, fractional quasiparticles, nonvanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</p>

            <p>A growing body of examples reveals that topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in shaping universal properties of quantum matter, as seen in fracton orders with size-dependent topological ground-state degeneracy and in cluster states with spurious topological entanglement entropy. We introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined on \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs) embedded in the bulk, as a direct probe of this intertwinement. By virtually tuning SES dimension, geometry and topology, the subleading components of SEE show sharply distinct geometric and topological responses in cluster states, $\mathbb{Z}_q$ topological orders, and fracton orders. Further viewing the SES reduced density matrix as a mixed state on the SES manifold, we establish an exact correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, distinguishing \textit{strong} from \textit{weak} classes. Nontrivial SEE enforces weak symmetries to act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of strong ones, together forming \textit{transparent composite symmetries} that are robust against finite depth quantum circuits. Due to the presence of transparent patch operators, each $D$-dimensional SES holographically encodes a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order. Thus, SEE simultaneously accesses various forefront directions, providing a unified and versatile nexus linking phenomena previously regarded as distinct.</p>

This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.

            <p>A critical step in developing circuits for quantum simulation is to synthesize a desired unitary operator using the circuit building blocks. Studying unitaries and their generators from the Lie algebraic perspective has given rise to several algorithms for synthesis based on a Cartan decomposition of the dynamical Lie algebra. For unitaries of the form $e^{-itH}$, such as time-independent Hamiltonian simulation, the resulting circuits have depth that does not depend on simulation time $t$. However, finding such circuits has a large classical overhead in the cost function evaluation and the high dimensional optimization problem. In this work, by further partitioning the dynamical Lie algebra, we break down the optimization problem into smaller independent subproblems. Moreover, the resulting algebraic structure allows us to easily shift the evaluation of the cost function to the quantum computer, further cutting the classical overhead of the algorithm. As an application of the new hybrid algorithm, we synthesize the time evolution unitary for the 4-site transverse field Ising model on several IBM devices and Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Xing, Giuliano Chiriacò, Paola Cappellaro, Rosario Fazio, Dario Poletti</p>
            <p>The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.</p>

            <h2>High-Performance Labyrinth Circular Bragg Grating Design for Charge and Stark-Tunable Quantum Light Sources Spanning Visible to Telecom Wavelengths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Prasad, Quirin Buchinger, Fei Chi Kristy Yuen, Yorick Reum, Sven Höfling, Tobias Huber-Loyola</p>
            <p>Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in circular Bragg gratings (CBGs) are among the most efficient integrated single-photon sources. However, the fully etched rings of conventional CBGs restrict the implementation of charge and Stark tuning via electrical contacts. To overcome this limitation, a labyrinth CBG geometry with four bridges has been proposed, yet the added bridges significantly degraded optical performance. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that a periodic labyrinth CBG design preserves both high coupling efficiency and strong Purcell enhancement while enabling electrical integration if optimized after introducing the bridges. We show three optimized designs at emission wavelengths of 780 nm, 930 nm, and 1550 nm, because these wavelengths are among the most relevant for quantum dots and show the general applicability of our approach. At all three wavelengths collection efficiencies exceeding 90% into a numerical aperture of 0.7 and Purcell factors greater than 25 are achieved. Furthermore, we propose a device layout incorporating a barrier layer that separates p- and n-doped semiconductor regions, which is incorporated to prevent tunneling of one of the charge carriers for selective charging. Also this design can be reoptimized to retain the performance of a device without tunnel barrier. These results establish labyrinth CBGs as a platform for electrically tunable quantum dot single-photon sources with high efficiency and scalability.</p>

            <p>We show that collective three-body interactions (3BIs), implementable with $N$ atoms loaded inside an optical cavity, offer a significant advantage for preparing complex multipartite entangled states. Firstly, they enable a speedup of order $\sim N$ in preparing generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, outperforming conventional methods based on all-to-all two-body Ising interactions. Secondly, they saturate the Heisenberg bound in phase estimation tasks using a time-reversal protocol realized through simple rotations and followed by experimentally accessible collective spin measurements. Lastly, compared with two-body interactions (2BIs), in the presence of cavity losses and single particle decoherence, 3BIs feature a high gain in sensitivity for moderate atom numbers and in large ensembles a fast entanglement generation despite constraints in parameter regimes where they are implementable.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic and Universal Frequency-Bin Gate for High-Dimensional Quantum Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen</p>
            <p>High-dimensional photonic systems access large Hilbert spaces for quantum information processing. They offer proven advantages in quantum computation, communication, and sensing. However, implementing scalable, low-loss unitary gates across many modes remains a central challenge. Here we propose a deterministic, universal, and fully programmable high-dimensional quantum gate based on a cavity-assisted sum-frequency-generation process, achieving near-unity fidelity. The device implements an M-by-N truncated unitary transformation (with 1 <= M < N), or a full unitary when M = N, on frequency-bin modes. With current technology, the attainable dimensionality reaches M-by-N on the order of ten to the power of four, with N up to about one thousand, and can be further increased using multiple pulse shapers. Combined with compatible SPDC sources, high-efficiency detection, and fast feed-forward, this approach provides a scalable, fiber-compatible platform for high-dimensional frequency-bin quantum processing.</p>

            <h2>Highly robust logical qubit encoding in an ensemble of V-symmetrical qutrits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Octavio Castaños-Cervantes, Manuel Calixto, Julio Guerrero</p>
            <p>We propose using even and odd Schödinger cat states formed from coherent states of U(3) of an ensemble of qutrits with a symmetrical V-configuration (a qubit-disguised qutrit) to encode a logical qubit. These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators.</p>

            <h2>Spin-photon Qubits for Scalable Quantum Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Sakibul Islam, Kuldeep Singh, Yunhe Zhao, Nitesh Singh, Wayesh Qarony</p>
            <p>Solid-state quantum light sources offer a scalable pathway for interfacing stationary spin qubits with flying photonic qubits, forming the backbone of future quantum networks. Telecom-band spin-photonic qubits, operating in the 1260-1675 nm wavelength range, are particularly well-suited for long-distance quantum communication due to minimal loss in standard optical fibers. Achieving scalability, however, hinges on fulfilling several stringent criteria: coherent spin-state control, deterministic and indistinguishable single-photon emission, and integration with nanophotonic structures that enhance radiative properties, such as lifetime, coherence, and photon indistinguishability. This study explores the state-of-the-art spin-photonic qubits across solid-state platforms, including diamond color centers, silicon carbide defect centers, quantum dots, and two-dimensional materials. Special attention is given to silicon-based emitters, particularly G, T, C- and Ci-centers, which promise monolithic integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and telecom-band operation. We classify these systems based on spin-photon interface availability, CMOS process compatibility, and emitter scalability. We also discuss recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), including Purcell enhancement and quality factor engineering in integrated photonic (circuits) environments. The work highlights emerging demonstrations of quantum networking over metropolitan scales and outlines the trajectory toward chip-scale quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs). It combines deterministic emitter creation, coherent spin manipulation, and quantum information processing. These developments pave the way for global quantum networks, enabling secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced sensing.</p>

            <p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been extensively exploited to enhance light--matter interactions in metamaterials, yet their emergence and utility in multi-atom waveguide platforms remain far less explored. Here we study atom--waveguide-dressed BICs in a one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguide, where two spatially separated atomic arrays couple to distinct resonators with time-dependent strengths. We show that these BICs support a standing-wave photonic mode and enable the transfer of an arbitrary unknown quantum state between the two arrays with fidelities exceeding $99\%$. The protocol remains robust against both disorder and intrinsic dissipation. Our results establish BICs as long-lived resources for high-fidelity quantum information processing in waveguide-QED architectures.</p>

            <p>Quantum network enables a variety of quantum information processing tasks, where multi-user quantum communication is one of the important objectives. Quantum cryptographic conferencing serves as an essential solution to establish secure keys to realize secure multi-user communications. However, existing QCC implementations have been fundamentally limited by the low probability of multi-user coincidence detection to measure or construct the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state. In this work, we report the experimental realization of QCC eliminating the need for coincidence detection, where the GHZ state is constructed by correlating detection events occurring within the coherence time, thereby greatly enhancing the success probability of GHZ-state measurement. Meanwhile, to establish and maintain high-visibility GHZ measurement among three independent users, we developed a three-party phase compensation scheme combined with precise temporal and polarization alignment within a time-bin-phase encoding framework. Furthermore, we designed an efficient pairing strategy to simplify subsequent data processing and enhance processing efficiency. Based on these techniques, we successfully performed QCC experiments over total channel losses of 66.3 dB, corresponding to 331.5 km of commercial fiber (0.2 dB/km), achieving secure key rates of 5.4 bit/s, whereas previous QCC experiments have been limited to 100 km. The results surpass the multi-user repeaterless bound in quantum networks, establishing a new regime of scalable, multi-user quantum communication and paving the way for metropolitan quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Dong, Xiaolin Zhou, Huang Peng, Wei Ni, Ekram Hossain, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>We address the multi-user quantum key distribution (QKD) problem under malicious quantum attacks, which is critical for realizing a large-scale quantum Internet. This paper maximizes the sum secret key rate (SKR) of a novel uplink non-orthogonal multiple access based continuous-variable QKD (NOMA-CVQKD) system under collective attacks. The proposed system uses Gaussian-modulated coherent states and a quantum successive interference cancellation based heterodyne receiver. We derive closed-form asymptotic bounds for the legitimate users' achievable key rates via the entropy power inequality and maximum entropy principle, as well as for the eavesdropper's intercepted information based on Holevo information. A successive convex approximation based power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the asymptotic sum SKR of the NOMA-CVQKD system under collective attacks, with guaranteed convergence to a locally optimal Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution. Simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-CVQKD system with the power allocation algorithm achieves up to 23% higher sum SKR than quantum-orthogonal multiple access, supports 16 users at excess noise variance 0.1, and remains robust under varying turbulence intensities and transmission distances.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Correlation Assisted Cooling of Microwave Cavities Below the Ambient Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daryoosh Vashaee, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.</p>

Building on Dicke's 1954 framework, we analyze the sequential emergence of coherence, superradiance, and entanglement, revealing a distinct temporal hierarchy in their extremal values: relative coherence develops first, followed by the peak of correlated emission, then minimal entanglement, and finally correlated dephasing. These findings suggest that enhanced relative coherence initiates correlated emission and when correlated dephasing is negligible, entanglement and correlated emission become tightly linked in time.</p>

            <p>Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) have emerged as a hybrid form of quantum computing devices designed to solve NP-complete problems, offering an exciting opportunity for discovering optimal solutions. Despite challenges such as susceptibility to noise-induced local minima, we achieved notable advantages in improving the computational accuracy and stability of CIMs. We conducted a successful experimental demonstration of CIM via femto-second laser pumping that integrates optimization strategies across optical and structural dimensions, resulting in significant performance enhancements. The results are particularly promising. An average success rate of 55% was achieved to identify optimal solutions within a Mobius Ladder graph comprising 100 vertices. Compared with other alternatives, the femto-second pulse results in significantly higher peak power, leading to more pronounced quantum effects and lower pump power in optical fiber based CIMs. In addition, we have maintained an impressive success rate for a continuous period of 8 hours, emphasizing the practical applicability of CIMs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our research extends to the application of these principles in practical applications such as molecular docking and credit scoring. The results presented substantiate the theoretical promise of CIMs, paving the way for their integration into large-scale practical applications.</p>

We present a single-cell identification approach using quantum-enhanced NMR with diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers for label-free detection of intracellular proton ($^1$H) signals. Using this method, we distinguish two human tumor cell lines by their proton spin-lattice ($T_1$) relaxation times, which serve as a cell-intrinsic physicochemical signature.

            <p>We present a framework for effectively simulating the execution of quantum circuits originally designed to demonstrate quantum supremacy using accessible high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Building on prior CPU-only approaches, our pipeline combines a single NVIDIA A100 GPU for quantum state construction, followed by N parallel CPU jobs that perform distributed measurement sampling. We validate the fidelity by simulating the 53-qubit, 14-cycle Sycamore circuit and achieving a linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score of 0.549, exceeding the published XEB score of 0.002 from Google's reference data. We then evaluate execution time performance with the more complex 53-qubit, 20-cycle circuit, completing the full 2.5 million-shot workload over 100 CPU jobs in 01:15:36, representing a 6.95 x 10^7 speedup compared to Google's original classical estimate. Further, we show that if 1,000 CPU jobs were employed, the estimated duration would be approximately 00:17:35, only 12 minutes slower than the time taken by the original QPU-based experiment. These results illustrate that 'quantum supremacy' is not fixed and continues to be a moving target. In addition, hybrid classical-quantum strategies may provide broader near-term quantum utility than once thought.</p>

            <p>We present a high-speed continuous-variable quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on heterodyne detection of vacuum fluctuations. The scheme follows a source-device-independent (SDI) security model in which the entropy originates from quantum measurement uncertainty and no model of the source is required; security depends only on the trusted measurement device and the calibrated discretization, and thus remains valid even under adversarial state preparation. The optical field is split by a 90$^\circ$ optical hybrid and measured by two balanced photodiodes to obtain both quadratures of the vacuum state simultaneously. The analog outputs are digitized using a dual-channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter operating at a sampling rate of 3.2 GS/s per channel, and processed in real time by an FPGA implementing Toeplitz hashing for randomness extraction. The quantum-to-classical noise ratio was verified through calibrated power spectral density measurements and cross-checked in the time domain, confirming vacuum-noise dominance within the 1.6 GHz detection bandwidth. After extraction, the system achieves a sustained generation rate of $R_{\rm net}= 33.92~\mathrm{Gbit/s}$ of uniformly distributed random bits, which pass all NIST and Dieharder statistical tests. The demonstrated platform provides a compact, FPGA-based realization of a practical heterodyne continuous-variable source-independent QRNG suitable for high-rate quantum communication and secure key distribution systems.</p>

The findings demonstrate that quantum coherence and DM interaction significantly enhance the energy storage efficiency and power output of the quantum battery, offering promising strategies for designing high-performance quantum energy storage devices. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of quantum battery under the influence of a common dephasing environment, which limits the long-term work-extraction capability of dipolar quantum batteries.</p>

The presence of photons in the resonator triggers the frequency conversion of photons. The scattering spectra and the conversion contrast are studied in both the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The disappearance of frequency conversion is rooted in the complete suppression of the emission from the excited state to either of lower states in the $n+1$ subspace where $n$ is the photon number of the resonator, and the non-Markovicity-induced nonreciprocity is found under specific conditions. Altering the photon number $n$ induces the non-reciprocal transmission of single photons in the waveguide, hence, enhance the conversion probability.</p>

            <p>Layered architectures for the Quantum Internet have been proposed, inspired by that of the classical Internet, which has demonstrated high maintainability even in large-scale systems. While lower layers in the Quantum Internet, such as entanglement generation and distribution, have been extensively studied, the application layer - responsible for translating user requests into executable quantum-network operations - remains largely unexplored. A significant challenge is translating application-level requests into the concrete instructions executable at lower layers. In this work, we introduce a RuleSet-based framework that explicitly incorporates the application layer into the layered architecture of the Quantum Internet. Our framework builds on a RuleSet-based protocol, clarifying communication procedures, organizing application request information, and introducing new Rules for application execution by embedding application specifications into RuleSets. To evaluate feasibility, we constructed state machines from the generated RuleSets. This approach enables a transparent integration from the application layer down to the physical layer, thereby lowering barriers to deploying new applications on the Quantum Internet.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect in the relaxation of open quantum systems whose effective dynamics is described by Davies maps. We present a class of unitary transformations based on permutation matrices that, acting on the initial state of the system, (i) suppress the contribution of slowest decaying modes of the nonunitary dynamics; (ii) ensure that it is as distinguishable as possible from the steady state. The first requirement guarantees an exponentially accelerating convergence to the steady state, while the second implies that a quantum system initially farther from equilibrium approaches it more rapidly than an initial state closer to it. This protocol provides a genuine Mpemba effect, and its numerical simulation requires low computational effort. We prove that, for any initial state, there always exists a permutation matrix that maximizes its distance from the equilibrium for a given information-theoretic distinguishability measure. We illustrate our findings for the nonunitary dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain and XXZ chain, each weakly coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, showing the quantum Mpemba effect captured by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, quantum relative entropy, and trace distance. Our results provide a universal and versatile framework to engineer the genuine quantum Mpemba effect in open quantum systems.</p>

These results demonstrate the viability of tantalum-based superconducting devices as reliable platforms for microwave quantum photonics.</p>

            <h2>Sharp values for all dynamical variables via Anti-Wick quantization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Friederich</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an approach to interpreting quantum expectation values that may help address the quantum measurement problem. Quantum expectation values are usually calculated via Hilbert space inner products and, thereby, differently from expectation values in classical mechanics, which are weighted phase-space integrals. It is shown that, by using Anti-Wick quantization to associate dynamical variables with self-adjoint linear operators, quantum expectation values can be interpreted as genuine weighted averages over phase space, paralleling their classical counterparts. This interpretation arises naturally in the Segal-Bargmann space, where creation and annihilation operators act as simple multiplication and differentiation operators. In this setting, the Husimi Q-function - the coherent-state representation of the quantum state - can be seen as a true probability density in phase space. Unlike Bohmian mechanics, the present approach retains the standard correspondence between dynamical variables and self-adjoint operators while paving the way for a classical-like probabilistic interpretation of quantum statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bartu Bisgin, Marwa Garsi, Andreas Welscher, Michael Hanke, Fleming Bruckmaier</p>
            <p>The increasing complexity of advanced semiconductor packages, driven by chiplet architectures and 2.5D/3D integration, challenges conventional failure localization methods such as lock-in thermography (LIT) and complicates current Failure Analysis (FA) workflows. Dense redistribution layers and buried interconnects limit the ability of established techniques to understand failure mechanisms non-destructively. In this work, we validate quantum diamond microscopy (QDM) based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a non-destructive localization method through magnetic current path imaging at the package level. Using commercial Integrated Fan-Out Package-on- Package (InFO-PoP) devices from iPhones, we showcase a complete FA workflow that includes QDM to localize a short-type failure at an Integrated Passive Device (IPD) at the package backside. We showcase that the QDM results provide invaluable information on top of conventional techniques and can significantly enhance root-cause identification in package-level FA workflows. This work demonstrates the potential of QDM for broader integration into semiconductor chip and package analysis workflows.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced charging power in nonreciprocal quantum battery by reservoir engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Yin Lin, Guang-Zheng Ye, Can Li, Wan-Jun Su, Huai-Zhi Wu</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to achieve a nonreciprocal quantum battery (QB) in the non-Hermitian (NH) system, which can overcome the intrinsic dissipation and reverse flow constraints. The design is based on a charger and a battery, which are coherently coupled and jointly interact with a bad cavity. By introducing the auxiliary bad cavity and exploiting the nonreciprocal condition, this model can harness the environmental dissipation to suppress the reverse energy transfer. Under resonant conditions, we have achieved a four ratio of the battery energy to the charger energy; in contrast, this ratio is significantly reduced under large detuning. Through damping optimization, high efficiency of the short-time charging power is attained. In comparison to the fully nonreciprocal scheme, the QB operating at the exceptional point (EP) exhibits greater resilience to parameter fluctuations. These findings highlight the potential of NH quantum engineering for advancing QB technology, particularly in regimes involving directional energy transfer, controlled dissipation, and entropy management in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a versatile control protocol based on modulated zero-pulse-area fields that dynamically suppresses Rydberg excitation while retaining Rydberg-Rydberg interactions as an entangling phase resource. This mechanism enables single-step, perfectly entangling phase gates for arbitrary blockade strengths, eliminating finite-blockade errors even when the Rabi frequency approaches or exceeds the interaction energy. The approach defines a new operational regime for Rydberg-blockade quantum logic in which speed, fidelity, and robustness are achieved simultaneously within a simple dynamical framework. Owing to its simplicity and generality, the technique is compatible with a wide range of neutral-atom architectures and offers a promising route toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computation and simulation.</p>

            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computing will require error rates far below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction (QEC) bridges this gap, but depends on decoders being simultaneously fast, accurate, and scalable. This combination of requirements has not yet been met by a machine-learning decoder, nor by any decoder for promising resource-efficient codes such as the colour code. Here we introduce AlphaQubit 2, a neural-network decoder that achieves near-optimal logical error rates for both surface and colour codes at large scales under realistic noise. For the colour code, it is orders of magnitude faster than other high-accuracy decoders. For the surface code, we demonstrate real-time decoding faster than 1 microsecond per cycle up to distance 11 on current commercial accelerators with better accuracy than leading real-time decoders. These results support the practical application of a wider class of promising QEC codes, and establish a credible path towards high-accuracy, real-time neural decoding at the scales required for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Kahan, Pablo Viñas, Torsten V. Zache, Alejandro Bermudez</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We propose an experimental apparatus to reveal the quantum coherence manifested in downward quantum jumps of amplitude bistability. The underlying coherent superposition of macroscopic quantum states is translated into the statistical properties of the integrated charge deposited in the detector circuit of a mode-matched heterodyne/homodyne detection scheme. At first, the dynamical evolution of a signal transmitted from an auxiliary cavity is employed to pinpoint a macroscopic switching event in a bistable main cavity subject to direct photodetection. Once the decision is made on the occurrence of a downward switch, the main cavity mode is let to freely decay to the vacuum, monitored to the production of an integrated charge. In the long-time limit, the charge distribution over an identical collection of pure states generated during the jumps converges to the Q function (heterodyne detection) or marginals of the Wigner function (homodyne detection) dictated by the phase of the local oscillator. When fluctuations over the ensemble step in, we connect the statistical properties of several switching events and the ensuing production of current records, to the cavity field correlations associated with the breakdown of photon blockade.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum systems harness the distinct advantages of different physical platforms, yet their integration is not always trivial due to potential incompatibilities in operational principles. Here, we theoretically propose and demonstrate a scheme for generating non-Gaussian mechanical states using a strongly driven hybrid system that combines cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and cavity optomechanics. Our protocol prepares a non-Gaussian cavity state in the dispersive regime of cavity QED and subsequently transfers it to a mechanical oscillator using the optomechanical interaction enhanced by a coherent cavity drive. While non-Gaussian cavity state control in cavity QED is well established in the dispersive regime, its behavior under strong cavity drive, essential for cavity optomechanics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we develop an efficient simulation framework to model cavity QED dynamics in the high-photon-number regime. We show that a strong cavity drive can coherently displace the cavity state with minimal perturbations, effectively decoupling it from the qubit. The resulting large coherent cavity field enhances the optomechanical coupling strength, enabling high-fidelity transfer of non-Gaussian cavity states to the mechanical mode. These results reveal new dynamical features of driven cavity QED and open a pathway toward realizing non-Gaussian mechanical quantum memories and sensors.</p>

            <p>Qubit readout is a critical operation in quantum computing systems, which maps the analog response of qubits into discrete classical states. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution to improve readout accuracy . Prior hardware implementations of DNN-based readout are resource-intensive and suffer from high inference latency, limiting their practical use in low-latency decoding and quantum error correction (QEC) loops. This paper proposes LUNA, a fast and efficient superconducting qubit readout accelerator that combines low-cost integrator-based preprocessing with Look-Up Table (LUT) based neural networks for classification. The architecture uses simple integrators for dimensionality reduction with minimal hardware overhead, and employs LogicNets (DNNs synthesized into LUT logic) to drastically reduce resource usage while enabling ultra-low-latency inference. We integrate this with a differential evolution based exploration and optimization framework to identify high-quality design points. Our results show up to a 10.95x reduction in area and 30% lower latency with little to no loss in fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art. LUNA enables scalable, low-footprint, and high-speed qubit readout, supporting the development of larger and more reliable quantum computing systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce two classes of lightweight, adaptive calibration protocols for quantum computers that leverage fast feedback. The first enables shot-by-shot updates to device parameters using measurement outcomes from simple, indefinite-outcome quantum circuits. This low-latency approach supports rapid tuning of one or more parameters in real time to mitigate drift. The second protocol updates parameters after collecting measurements from definite-outcome circuits (e.g.~syndrome extraction circuits for quantum error correction), balancing efficiency with classical control overheads. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that both methods can calibrate 1- and 2-qubit gates rapidly and accurately even in the presence of decoherence, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and parameter drift. We propose and demonstrate effective adaptive strategies for tuning the hyperparameters of both protocols. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time in-situ calibration of qubits performing quantum error correction, using only syndrome data, via numerical simulations of syndrome extraction in the [[5,1,3]] code.</p>

            <h2>Comparing quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps: A physically meaningful approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arindam Mitra, Jatin Ghai</p>
            <p>In quantum technologies, quantum channels are essential elements for the transmission of quantum states. The action of a quantum channel usually introduces noise in the quantum state and thereby reduces the information contained in it. Concatenating a quantum channel with another quantum channel makes it more noisy and degrades its information and resource preservability. These are mathematically described by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps that represent the generic evolution of quantum systems. These are special cases of Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. In this work, we demonstrate a physically meaningful way to compare a pair of quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. More precisely, given a pair of quantum channels and an arbitrary unknown input state, we show that if the output state of one quantum channel from the pair can be obtained from the output statistics of the other channel from the pair using some quantum measurement, then the latter channel from the pair can be obtained from the former channel by concatenating it with a Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear map. This relation between these two channels is a preorder, and we try to study its characterization in this work. We also illustrate the implications of our results for the incompatibility of quantum devices through an example.</p>

It is well known that there are also a variety of methods in the field of magnetic field sensing in laboratory, e.g. Ramsey protocol of NV centers in diamond. Here, we compare the RPM model and Ramsey-like model under laboratory conditions and under in vivo conditions respectively. The results are both surprising and reasonable. Under laboratory conditions, if we have precise control over time and a reasonably accurate prior knowledge of the magnetic field direction, the Ramsey-like model will outperform the RPM model. However, when such information is unavailable, as under in vivo conditions, the RPM model stands out. The RPM model achieves greater practicality at the cost of reduced accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiu-Qi Chen, Rui-Zhi Zhang, Gang-Qin Liu, Huijie Zheng</p>
            <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have precipitated profound advances in microwave detection, manifesting themselves both in spatial resolution and sensitivity. However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\rm{\Omega}$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders. Our results augment the applicability of diamond-based microwave devices in applications under complex scenarios, especially where large dynamic range, fast test speed, and high spatial resolution are demanded.</p>

            <p>Temporal single-photon (TSP-) LiDAR presents a promising solution for imaging-free target recognition over long distances with reduced size, cost, and power consumption. However, existing TSP-LiDAR approaches are ineffective in handling open-set scenarios where unknown targets emerge, and they suffer significant performance degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and short acquisition times (fewer photons). Here, inspired by semantic communication, we propose a semantic TSP-LiDAR based on a self-updating semantic knowledge base (SKB), in which the target recognition processing of TSP-LiDAR is formulated as a semantic communication. The results, both simulation and experiment, demonstrate that our approach surpasses conventional methods, particularly under challenging conditions of low SNR and limited acquisition time. More importantly, our self-updating SKB mechanism can dynamically update the semantic features of newly encountered targets in the SKB, enabling continuous adaptation without the need for extensive retraining of the neural network. In fact, a recognition accuracy of 89% is achieved on nine types of unknown targets in real-world experiments, compared to 66% without the updating mechanism. These findings highlight the potential of our framework for adaptive and robust target recognition in complex and dynamic environments.</p>

The benefits and challenges of quantum technologies are examined from a diplomatic and geopolitical perspective to help leaders make informed strategic decisions. Leading powers now recognise quantum as a domain where technological leadership directly translates to geopolitical influence, compelling an intense race for dominance alongside new forms of multilateral diplomacy aimed at managing both risks and opportunities. Quantum technologies do not all have the same operational maturity, but technological progress is accelerating. Post-quantum cryptography demands immediate action -- every encrypted communication created today may be harvested and decrypted within the decade by adversaries equipped with quantum capabilities.</p>

            <p>We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7°$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at ${\mu}{\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material.</p>

            <p>We develop a finite-dimensional formulation of the recently introduced notion of ``timelike entanglement'', defined in terms of two-point functions between operators supported on different Cauchy slices. Using a local orthonormal operator basis, we recast this construction in terms of a generalized response tensor.

We show that the Haar-averaged $(2N)$-point function yields the $(2N)$-th moment of the spectral form factor (SFF), evaluated at an $N$-enhanced effective temperature. The correlation functions of the GSDK operators also yield the SFF, with an effective $(1/N)$-reduction of the physical time-scales. The GSDK places both scrambling diagnostics and spectral statistics on a similar footing and clarifies how higher-point correlators and non-trivial time ordering capture fine-grained dynamical information of a quantum system.</p>

            <p>Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding free energies (BFEs) remains a central challenge in drug discovery, particularly because the most reliable methods, such as free energy perturbation (FEP), are computationally intensive and difficult to scale. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework that combines Mining Minima sampling with quantum mechanically refined ligand partial charges, QM/MM interaction evaluation, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)-based electronic energy correction. This design enables explicit treatment of polarization, charge redistribution, and electronic correlation effects that are often underestimated in purely classical scoring schemes, while retaining computational efficiency. Across 23 protein targets and 543 ligands, the method achieves a mean absolute error of about 1.10 kcal/mol with strong rank-order fidelity (Pearson R = 0.75, Spearman rho = 0.76, Kendall tau = 0.57), consistent with the performance of contemporary FEP protocols. Notably, the workflow requires only about 25 minutes per ligand on standard compute resources, resulting in an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational cost relative to alchemical free energy approaches. This level of accuracy and efficiency makes the method well-suited for high-throughput lead optimization and iterative design cycles in pharmaceutical discovery. The framework also provides a natural foundation for future integration with machine learning models to enable predictive, large-scale, and adaptive screening strategies.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of carbon self-interstitial defects in diamond, ranging from mono- to hexa-interstitial complexes. By quantum mechanical density functional theory, empowered by interatomic potential models, we efficiently sample the complex configurational landscape and identify both known and previously unreported defect geometries. Our results reveal a pronounced energetic driving force for aggregation: the formation energy per interstitial decreases systematically from isolated split interstitials to compact multi-interstitial clusters, with the tetra-interstitial platelet emerging as a particularly stable structural motif. Additionally, charge analysis indicates that the predominantly covalent bonding in diamond becomes more polar within the defect centers. Analysis of defect energy levels shows that only the investigated mono-, di-, penta-, and hexa-interstitial complexes introduce in-gap electronic states, whereas the tri- and tetra-interstitial clusters are electronically inert. Vibrational spectroscopies further reveal that self-interstitials generate characteristic signatures. Short carbon-carbon bonds inside the defect cores give rise to high-frequency vibrational modes between 1375 and 1925 cm$^{-1}$, which are strongly IR-active but exhibit weak Raman activity. Taken together, these findings provide a coherent picture of the structural, electronic, and vibrational characteristics of carbon self-interstitials and establish a robust framework for their experimental identification.</p>

            <p>A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.</p>

Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.</p>

            <h2>Dispersion Engineering of Planar Sub-millimeter Wave Waveguides and Resonators with Low Radiation Loss</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Furkan Sahbaz, Simeon I. Bogdanov</p>
            <p>Mm-wave and THz superconducting circuits find numerous applications in areas ranging from quantum information and sensing to high-energy physics. Planar THz transmission lines and resonators are fabrication-friendly, compact, and scalable, and they can be efficiently interfaced with external signals and controls. However, planar circuits radiate strongly at high frequencies, which precludes their use in loss-sensitive applications. Here, we present the design and characterization of planar dispersion-engineered transmission lines that effectively suppress radiation leakage in desired mm-wave bands. We extend this concept to design planar resonators with extremely low radiation leakage, resulting in radiation Q-factors above 106 at 553 GHz. Low-loss planar THz circuitry will impact many application domains, including broadband communications, quantum information, radio astronomy, and cosmology.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors based on electronic spins have emerged as powerful probes of microwave-frequency fields. Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in deuterated naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of approximately $1~\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing in addition to demonstrating control techniques broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Integrable construction of a two-dimensional lattice model with anisotropic Hubbard couplings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze Tao, Fujun Liu</p>
            <p>By defining a graded global R-operator $\mathbb{R}_{ab}^{(2D,2S)}$ that couples free-fermion structures and incorporates anisotropic Hubbard interactions while satisfying the Yang--Baxter equation, we construct a strictly solvable two-dimensional lattice model. We then build the layer-to-layer transfer matrix through a bidirectional-monodromy construction and prove the model's integrability via the associated global RTT relations. Using the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz, we obtain the exact eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and derive the corresponding first- and second-level Bethe equations. Finally, by taking the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix at the regular point, we recover explicitly a local Hamiltonian that features anisotropic hopping, an on-site Hubbard interaction, and orbital-coupling contributions.</p>

            <p>To date, most integrated quantum photonics experiments rely on single-photon detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures coupled to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) through single-mode optical fibers. This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Induced Vacuum Polarization and Mode Shifts in Maxwell-Klein-Gordon Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Wang, Jun Wang, Yong-Long Wang</p>
            <p>Geometric confinement is known to modify single-particle dynamics through effective potentials, yet its imprint on the interacting quantum vacuum remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the Maxwell--Klein--Gordon system constrained to curved surfaces and demonstrate that the geometric potential $\Sigma_{\mathrm{geom}}(\mathbf{r})$ acts as a local renormalization environment. We show that extrinsic curvature modifies the scalar loop spectrum, entering the vacuum polarization as a position-dependent mass correction $M^2(\mathbf{r}) \to m^2 + \Sigma_{\mathrm{geom}}(\mathbf{r})$. This induces a finite, gauge-invariant ``geometry-induced running'' of the electromagnetic response. In the long-wavelength regime ($|{\bf Q}|R \ll 1$), we derive a closed-form expression for the relative frequency shift $\Delta\omega/\omega$, governed by the overlap between the electric energy density and the geometric potential. Applying this formalism to Gaussian bumps, cylindrical shells, and tori, we identify distinct spectral signatures that distinguish these quantum loop corrections from classical geometric optics. Our results suggest that spatial curvature can serve as a tunable knob for ``vacuum engineering,'' offering measurable shifts in high-$Q$ cavities and plasmonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi-Sheng Chen, Xinyu Zhang, Rong Fu, Qiuzhe Xie, Fan Zhang</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning offers a promising pathway for enhancing stock market prediction, particularly under complex, noisy, and highly dynamic financial environments. However, many classical forecasting models struggle with noisy input, regime shifts, and limited generalization capacity. To address these challenges, we propose a Quantum Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (QTCNN) that combines a classical temporal encoder with parameter-efficient quantum convolution circuits for cross-sectional equity return prediction. The temporal encoder extracts multi-scale patterns from sequential technical indicators, while the quantum processing leverages superposition and entanglement to enhance feature representation and suppress overfitting. We conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study on the JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange dataset and evaluate predictions through long-short portfolio construction using out-of-sample Sharpe ratio as the primary performance metric. QTCNN achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.538, outperforming the best classical baseline by approximately 72\%. These results highlight the practical potential of quantum-enhanced forecasting model, QTCNN, for robust decision-making in quantitative finance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Liang Gao, Jie-Yu Zhang, Zheng-Xin Liu, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>Strange correlator is a powerful tool widely used in detecting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haipeng Cao, Kaining Zhang, Dacheng Tao, Zhaofeng Su</p>
            <p>Quantum generative models leverage quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance learning efficiency for both classical and quantum data. The quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM), inspired by its classical counterpart, has been proposed as a promising framework for quantum generative learning. QuDDPM is capable of efficiently learning and generating quantum data, and it demonstrates excellent performance in learning correlated quantum noise models, quantum many-body phases, and the topological structure of quantum data. However, we show that barren plateaus emerge in QuDDPMs due to the use of 2-design states as the input for the denoising process, which severely undermines the performance of QuDDPM. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we confirm the presence of barren plateaus in the original QuDDPM. To address this issue, we introduce an improved QuDDPM that utilizes a distribution maintaining a certain distance from the Haar distribution, ensuring better trainability. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the barren plateau problem and generates samples with higher quality, paving the way for scalable and efficient quantum generative learning.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of the electron spin resonance of topological defects (edge state) in dimerized chains. These objects are discontinuities of the spin chain protected by the properties of the global system leading to a quantum many-body multiplet protected from the environment decoherence. Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yantao Wu</p>
            <p>Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijiang Ji, Yunbo Zhang, Shu Chen, Zhihao Xu</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence and control of multiple topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide lattice with generalized Bernoulli-type disorder introduced in the intradimer couplings. By systematically varying the disorder configuration -- including the values and probabilities of the multivariate distribution -- we demonstrate that both the number and width of TAI phases can be precisely engineered. Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean chiral displacement serves as a sensitive probe for detecting these topological transitions, providing a practical route for experimental realization in photonic waveguide lattices. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing quantum and photonic materials with customizable topological properties driven by tailored disorder.</p>

Furthermore, we apply our results to two fundamental questions: (i) the properties of the reduced density matrix of the central system in an eigenstate, and (ii) the structure of the off-diagonal smooth function within the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Numerical results are also presented in support of our main findings.</p>

            <h2>The Fine-Structure Constant as a Scaled Quantity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry Sticker</p>
            <p>The fine-structure constant alpha approximately 1/137 is traditionally regarded as a fundamental dimensionless parameter. I argue instead that alpha is a scaled quantity that arises only where the structural scales contributed by classical electromagnetism (e), quantum mechanics (h-bar), and special relativity (c) intersect. None of these theories, taken individually, supplies the independent scales required to define alpha. The constant first appears when relativistic corrections are added to the Schrodinger-Bohr description of hydrogen (Sommerfeld), and it becomes the structural coupling in quantum electrodynamics, where quantum and relativistic effects modify the classical electromagnetic interaction. Expressing the governing laws in canonical form reveals this dependence and eliminates representational artifacts that make alpha appear fundamental. The running of alpha in QED further demonstrates its status as a scale-dependent coupling rather than a universal constant. I conclude that alpha is a domain-specific structural ratio reflecting contingent relationships among independent physical scales.</p>

            <h2>Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover</p>
            <p>Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</p>

            <p>Transition metal doping is commonly used for altering the properties of solid-state materials to suit applications in science and technology. Partially filled $d$-shells of transition metal atoms lead to electronic states with diverse spatial and spin symmetries. Chromium(III) cations have shown great potential for designing laser materials and, more recently, for developing spin qubits in quantum applications. They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems. Recently, the periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method has been shown to overcome some limitations arising in the calculations of excited $d$-states. In this work, we assess the suitability of DFT and pEHCF to calculate the electronic structure and $d$-$d$ excitations of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap host materials. The results will aid computational development of novel transition metal-doped materials and provide a deeper understanding of the complex nature of transition metal dopants in solids.</p>

The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge.</p>

            <p>The scalability of quantum photonic integrated circuits opens the path towards large-scale quantum computing and communication. To date, this scalability has been limited by the stochastic nature of the quantum light sources. Moreover, hybrid integration of different platforms will likely be necessary to combine state-of-the-art devices into a functioning architecture. Here, we demonstrate the active alignment and edge-coupling of arrays of ten site-controlled gallium arsenide quantum dots to an array of ten silicon nitride single-mode waveguides, at cryogenic temperatures. The coupling is facilitated by the fabrication of nanopillars, deterministically self-aligned around each quantum dot, leading to a high-yield and regular array of single-photon sources. An on-chip beamsplitter verifies the triggered emission of single photons into the silicon nitride chip. The low inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble enables us to observe the spectral overlap of adjacent site-controlled emitters. Across the array of waveguides, the signal collected from each coupled quantum dot is consistently and reproducibly 0.17 relative to the free-space collection from the very same single-photon source. Comparing measurement with waveguide simulations, we infer that absolute coupling efficiencies of $\approx 5 \%$ are currently obtained between our quantum dots and the waveguides.</p>

We demonstrate the generality of the method on flows through structured media and complex vascular geometries, establishing for the first time that tensor-network techniques can efficiently resolve fluid dynamics in complex, irregular domains. We show that in the presence of translational or approximate symmetries of the geometry, fluid states exhibit low effective complexity in MPS form, yielding compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude while preserving physical structure and dynamical fidelity. This reduction enables systematic numerical exploration of regimes that were previously intractable. Our results position tensor networks as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics.</p>

In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs.

Finally, we compute the Krylov complexity analytically in the limit of early and late time in the charge sector and numerically for both canonical and grand canonical ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Key Analysis of Quantum Key Distribution with Characterized Devices Using Entropy Accumulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian George, Jie Lin, Thomas van Himbeeck, Kun Fang, Norbert Lütkenhaus</p>
            <p>The Entropy Accumulation Theorem (EAT) was introduced to significantly improve the finite-size rates for device-independent quantum information processing tasks such as device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD). A natural question would be whether it also improves the rates for device-dependent QKD. In this work, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. We present new tools for applying the EAT in the device-dependent setting. We present sufficient conditions for the Markov chain conditions to hold as well as general algorithms for constructing the needed min-tradeoff function. Utilizing Dupuis' recent privacy amplification without smoothing result, we improve the key rate by optimizing the sandwiched Rényi entropy directly rather than considering the traditional smooth min-entropy. We exemplify these new tools by considering several examples including the BB84 protocol with the qubit-based version and with a realistic parametric downconversion source, the six-state four-state protocol and a high-dimensional analog of the BB84 protocol.</p>

            <h2>Correlation as a Resource in Unitary Quantum Measurements</h2>

            <p>Quantum measurement is a physical process. What physical resources and constraints does quantum mechanics require for measurement to produce the classical world we observe? Treating measurement as a fully unitary quantum process, our goal is to show that objective, redundant, and correctly aligned outcomes are possible iff the environment begins in a specially structured, correlated subspace. We start with a minimal set of assumptions: unitarity, orthogonality of conditional environment branches, and finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Using these, we demonstrate that generic environmental states cannot support redundant and mutually consistent records of the signal, the measured quantum system. The admissible initial states form a subspace on which the measurement maps obey the Knill-Laflamme error-correction conditions, revealing that the emergence of classical objectivity relies on the environment behaving like a quantum error-correcting code. The post-measurement subspace naturally factorizes into a ``pointer'' to hold measurement outcomes and ``memory'' to retain pre-measurement quantum information about the environment's state, thereby respecting the no-deletion theorem. This further allows the identification of correlation as a finite resource consumed during measurement. Through an explicit qudit model with local interactions, we demonstrate how correlated environments yield redundant observer networks. Simulations show that record fidelity and redundancy depend on the initial correlations in the environment. This perspective links quantum Darwinism to error correction and raises the possibility that natural processes may prepare and evolutionarily favour environments capable of supporting reliable measurement.</p>

            <h2>One-Shot Distributed Source Simulation: As Quantum as it Can Get</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian George, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Eric Chitambar</p>
            <p>Distributed source simulation is the task where two (or more) parties share some correlated randomness and use local operations and no communication to convert this into some target correlation. Wyner's seminal result showed that asymptotically the rate of uniform shared randomness needed for this task is given by a mutual information induced measure, now referred to as Wyner's common information. This asymptotic result was extended by Hayashi in the quantum setting to separable states, the largest class of states for which this task can be performed to vanishing error. In this work we characterize this task in a near-tight manner in the one-shot setting using the smooth entropy framework. We do this by introducing one-shot operational quantities and correlation measures that characterize them. We establish asymptotic equipartition properties for our correlation measures thereby recovering the previous vanishing-error asymptotic results. In doing so, we consider technical points in one-shot network information theory and provide methods for cardinality bounds in the smooth entropy calculus. We also introduce entangled state versions of the distributed source simulation task and determine bounds in this setting via quantum embezzling. This provides a strong characterization of this network task in the one-shot, quantum regime.</p>

            <h2>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianqi Chen, Ruizhe Shen, Ching Hua Lee, Bo Yang, Raditya Weda Bomantara</p>
            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</p>

            <h2>Asymptotic implementation of multipartite quantum channels and other quantum instruments using local operations and classical communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott M. Cohen</p>
            <p>We prove a necessary condition that a quantum channel on a multipartite system may be approximated arbitrarily closely using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We then extend those arguments to obtain a condition that applies to all quantum instruments, which range from the most refined case, a generalized measurement, to the most coarse-grained, which is a quantum channel. We illustrate these results by a detailed analysis of a quantum instrument that is known not to be implementable by LOCC, but which can be arbitrarily closely approximated within that framework. As one outgrowth of this analysis, we find a quantum measurement that falls into the same category: it cannot be implemented exactly by LOCC, but can be approximated by LOCC arbitrarily closely. This measurement has an infinite number of outcomes, leaving open the question as to whether or not there exists a measurement within this same category but having only a finite number of outcomes.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is the essential resource for quantum communication and distributed information processing in a quantum network. However, the remote generation over a network suffers from inevitable transmission loss and other technical difficulties. This paper introduces the concept of entanglement buffers as a potential primitive for preparing long-distance entanglement. We investigate the filling of entanglement buffers with either one Bell state or a stream of Bell states via SWAP interactions. We illustrate their resilience to imperfect interactions, noise, and losses, making the buffers suitable for a realistic quantum network scenario. Additionally, larger entanglement buffers can always enhance these benefits.</p>

            <h2>Efficient and high-performance routing of lattice-surgery paths on three-dimensional lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kou Hamada, Yasunari Suzuki, Yuuki Tokunaga</p>
            <p>Encoding logical qubits with surface codes and performing multi-qubit logical operations with lattice surgery is one of the most promising approaches to demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computing. Thus, a method to efficiently schedule a sequence of lattice-surgery operations is vital for high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing. A possible strategy to improve the throughput of lattice-surgery operations is splitting a large instruction into several small instructions such as Bell state preparation and measurements and executing a part of them in advance. However, scheduling methods to fully utilize this idea have yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose a fast and high-performance scheduling algorithm for lattice-surgery instructions leveraging this strategy. We achieved this by converting the scheduling problem of lattice-surgery instructions to a graph problem of embedding 3D paths into a 3D lattice, which enables us to explore efficient scheduling by solving path search problems in the 3D lattice. Based on this reduction, we propose a method to solve the path-finding problems, look-ahead Dijkstra projection. We numerically show that this method reduced the execution time of benchmark programs generated from quantum phase estimation algorithms by 3.8 times compared with a naive method based on greedy algorithms. Our study establishes the relation between the lattice-surgery scheduling and graph search problems, which leads to further theoretical analysis on compiler optimization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Self-Testing Graph States Permitting Bounded Classical Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uta Isabella Meyer, Ivan Šupić, Frédéric Grosshans, Damian Markham</p>
            <p>Self-testing identifies quantum states and correlations that exhibit nonlocality, distinguishing them, up to local transformations, from other quantum states. Due to their strong nonlocality, it is known that all graph states can be self-tested in the standard setting - where parties are not allowed to communicate. Recently it has been shown that graph states display nonlocal correlations even when bounded classical communication on the underlying graph is permitted, a feature that has found applications in proving a circuit-depth separation between classical and quantum computing. In this work, we develop self testing in the framework of bounded classical communication, and we show that certain graph states can be robustly self-tested even allowing for communication. In particular, we provide an explicit self-test for the circular graph state and the honeycomb cluster state - the latter known to be a universal resource for measurement based quantum computation. Since communication generally obstructs self-testing of graph states, we further provide a procedure to robustly self-test any graph state from larger ones that exhibit nonlocal correlations in the communication scenario.</p>

            <h2>Preparing matrix product states via fusion: constraints and extensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David T. Stephen, Oliver Hart</p>
            <p>In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries, including anomalous and non-invertible symmetries, and also serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. We also discuss constraints on SIMPS fusion and propose a general framework for fusion that encompasses the MPS and SIMPS protocols. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenfeng Cao, Yeqing Zhou, Swamit Tannu, Nic Shannon, Robert Joynt</p>
            <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a promising pathway toward achieving practical quantum advantage on near-term hardware. Despite this promise, for generic, expressive ansätze, their scalability is critically hindered by barren plateaus--regimes of exponentially vanishing gradients. We demonstrate that initializing a hardware-efficient, Floquet-structured ansatz within the many-body localized (MBL) phase mitigates barren plateaus and enhances algorithmic trainability. Through analysis of the inverse participation ratio, entanglement entropy, and a novel low-weight stabilizer Rényi entropy, we characterize a distinct MBL-thermalization transition. Below a critical kick strength, the circuit avoids forming a unitary 2-design, exhibits robust area-law entanglement, and maintains non-vanishing gradients. Leveraging this MBL regime facilitates the efficient variational preparation of ground states for several model Hamiltonians with significantly reduced computational resources. Crucially, experiments on a 127-qubit superconducting processor provide evidence for the preservation of trainable gradients in the MBL phase for a kicked Heisenberg chain, validating our approach on contemporary noisy hardware. Our findings position MBL-based initialization as a viable strategy for developing scalable VQAs and motivate broader integration of localization into quantum algorithm design.</p>

            <p>The existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid (i.e., diabolically degenerated exceptional) singularities of simple bosonic systems composed of up to five modes with damping and/or amplification are analyzed. Their dynamics governed by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is followed using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Their dynamical matrices generally exhibit specific structures that allow for an effective reduction of their dimension by half. This facilitates analytical treatment and enables efficient spectral analysis based on characteristic second-order diabolical degeneracies. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points, observed directly in the dynamics of field operators, having up to third-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed. Surprisingly, exceptional degeneracies of only second and third orders are revealed, even though the systems with up to five modes are considered. Exceptional and diabolical genuine points and their degeneracies observed in the dynamics of second-order field-operator moments are also analyzed. Each analyzed bosonic system exhibits its own unique and complex dynamical behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu</p>
            <p>We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.</p>

            <p>This study examines the potential for fault-tolerant quantum computers to provide utility in fluid dynamics simulations, with a focus on drag force calculations for ship hull design. We assess whether quantum algorithms can surpass classical computational limits by generating detailed quantum resource estimates (QREs) in terms of logical qubits and $T$-gate counts. Our analysis is based on a quantum algorithm leveraging Carleman linearization of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which has been suggested to offer exponential speedup. We develop efficient block encodings for LBM matrices and a method for amplitude-encoding drag force. We apply the method to the simple case of fluid flow past a sphere across a range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). We estimate the required (logical qubits)$\times$($T$-gates), finding them to be prohibitively large, ranging from $10^{21}$ to $10^{39}$. While classical simulations scale as $O(\mathrm{Re}^3)$, our QREs exhibit a modest polynomial scaling of $O(\mathrm{Re}^{2.68})$, indicating no exponential quantum advantage. We attribute this limitation to an intrinsic power-law relationship between spatial grid resolution and time-stepping requirements that is a fundamental characteristic of explicit methods for evolving nonlinear differential equations. Thus, quantum computers are unlikely to provide utility in applications that require time-evolving fluids and other systems of nonlinear differential equations.</p>

Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.</p>

            <p>In the realm of quantum information processing, the efficient characterization of entangled states poses an overwhelming challenge, rendering the traditional methods including quantum tomography unfeasible and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a new verification scheme using collective strategies, showcasing arbitrarily high efficiency that beats the optimal verification with global measurements. Our collective scheme can be implemented in various experimental platforms and scalable for large systems with a linear scaling on hardware requirement, and distributed operations are allowed. Notably, larger ensembles can always improve the efficiency further, but without increasing the quantum memory. More importantly, the approach consumes only a few copies of the entangled states, while ensuring the preservation of unmeasured ones, and even boosting their fidelity for any subsequent tasks. Furthermore, our protocol provides additional insight into the specific types of noise affecting the system, thereby facilitating potential targeted improvements. These advancements hold promise for a wide range of applications, offering a pathway towards more robust and efficient quantum information processing.</p>

One-dimensional tensor networks -- often referred to as tensor trains (TT) or matrix product states (MPS) -- are increasingly being used as a numerical ansatz for continuum functions by ``quantizing'' the inputs into discrete binary digits. Here we demonstrate the power of more general tree tensor networks for this purpose. We provide direct constructions of a number of elementary functions as generic tree tensor networks and interpolative constructions for more complicated functions via a generalization of the tensor cross interpolation algorithm. For a range of multi-dimensional functions we show how more structured tree tensor networks offer a significantly more efficient ansatz than the commonly used tensor train. We demonstrate an application of our methods to solving multi-dimensional, non-linear Fredholm equations, providing a rigorous bound on the rank of the solution which, in turn, guarantees exponentially scaling accuracy with the size of the tree tensor network for certain problems.</p>

We prove this result analytically using a quantum error correction formulation, demonstrate its applicability numerically, and discuss consequences for the disentanglability of states generated through Hamiltonian dynamics. We show that this result implies a novel representation of approximate state designs that can also facilitate their efficient generation, and we propose a novel quantum circuit compression scheme for Clifford circuits doped with non-Clifford phase gates.</p>

            <p>Quantum dynamics governs the transformation of static quantum resources, such as coherence and entanglement, in both quantum states and measurements. Prior studies have established that a quantum channel's state-cohering power can be converted into the state-entangling power without additional coherence. Here, we complete this coherence-to-entanglement paradigm by demonstrating that a channel's measurement-cohering power can likewise be converted into the measurement-entangling power. This result reinforces, on the dynamical level, the intuition that entanglement emerges as a manifestation of coherence. To formalize this picture, we develop resource theories for measurement-cohering and measurement-entangling powers and characterize the structure of incoherent measurements to analyze measurement-coherence generation. Furthermore, we show that the state-cohering power of a quantum channel is equivalent to the measurement-cohering power of its adjoint map, and a corresponding equivalence also exists between the state-entangling power and the measurement-entangling power.</p>

In addition to exploring the physics of such dualities, these codes possess useful QEC properties such as tunable encoding rates, distance scaling competitive with topological codes, and excellent recovery thresholds. To allow for a comprehensive analysis of holographic code constructions, we introduce LEGO_HQEC, a software package utilizing the quantum LEGO formalism. This package constructs holographic codes on regular hyperbolic tilings and generates their stabilizer generators and logical operators for a specified number of seed codes and layers. Three decoders are included: an erasure decoder based on Gaussian elimination; an integer-optimization decoder; and a tensor-network decoder.

By employing the representation theory of the unitary and orthogonal groups, we provide a general recipe for determining the set of $(n,m)$-extendible and $n$-de Finetti-extendible Brauer states. From the concrete form of the commutant of the diagonal action of the orthogonal group, we explicitly determine the set of parameters for which the Brauer states are $(1,2)$-, $(1,3)$- and $(2,2)$-extendible in any dimension $d$ and find that Brauer states extend with a non-trivial trade-off in $n$ and $m$. Using the same recipe we also provide an estimate of the set of $(1,m)$-extendible Brauer states for any $m$ and dimension $d$. Finally, using the branching rules from $\mathrm{U}(d)$ to $\mathrm{O}(d)$, we obtain the set of $n$-de Finetti-extendible Brauer states in any dimension, and also analytically describe the $n\to\infty$ limiting shape which turns out not to be a polygon for odd dimensions.</p>

This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices.

An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states.

            <p>We propose a scalable trapped-ion quantum-computing architecture that efficiently incorporates quantum error correction. The chip design exploits orthogonal qubit connectivity by assigning horizontal trap regions to transversal logical gates and vertical regions to non-transversal gates and syndrome extraction, thereby enabling universal gate operations with minimal ion shuttling and reduced hardware complexity. Using a dedicated software tool, we evaluate the architecture on several benchmark algorithms and scheduling policies for two-dimensional color code of varying code distance. Our results demonstrate that increasing the code distance by two reduces the effective logical two-qubit gate error probability by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching values as low as $10^{-8}$ with the $[[31, 1, 7]]$ color code. This improvement substantially expands the range of algorithms that can be executed reliably, up to scales of a few thousand logical qubits, depending on the algorithmic structure. Overall, these findings validate the practicality and scalability of the proposed architecture and its control strategies, highlighting a viable route toward fault-tolerant, trapped-ion quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Nonclassical nullifiers for quantum hypergraph states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijith Ravikumar, Darren W. Moore, Radim Filip</p>
            <p>Quantum hypergraph states form a generalisation of the graph state formalism that goes beyond the pairwise (dyadic) interactions imposed by remaining inside the Gaussian approximation. Networks of such states are able to achieve universality for continuous variable measurement based quantum computation with only Gaussian measurements. For normalised states, the simplest hypergraph states are formed from $k$-adic interactions among a collection of $k$ harmonic oscillator ground states. However such powerful resources have not yet been observed in experiments and their robustness and scalability have not been tested. Here we develop and analyse necessary criteria for hypergraph nonclassicality based on simultaneous nonlinear squeezing in the nullifiers of hypergraph states. We put forward an essential analysis of their robustness to realistic scenarios involving thermalisation or loss and suggest several basic proof-of-principle options for experiments to observe nonclassicality in hypergraph states.</p>

            <p>The unification of quantum theory and the general theory of relativity - describing gravity, is one of the most important challenges in science. Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence, and has been confirmed to great accuracy for large bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase, equal to the quantum phase of a free-falling object. To measure this phase, we realize a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave-packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. The observed relative-phase of the wave-packets confirms the predicted phase of a free-falling object, and shows that in our low energy regime, the equivalence principle may be applied to the quantum domain. Our observation constitutes a fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</p>

            <p>In this work we introduce a superconducting quantum processor architecture that uses a transmission-line resonator to implement effective all-to-all connectivity between six transmon qubits. This architecture can be used as a test-bed for algorithms that benefit from high connectivity. We show that the central resonator can be used as a computational element, which offers the flexibility to encode a qubit for quantum computation or to utilize its bosonic modes which further enables quantum simulation of bosonic systems. To operate the quantum processing unit (QPU), we develop and benchmark the qubit-resonator conditional Z gate and the qubit-resonator MOVE operation. The latter allows for transferring a quantum state between one of the peripheral qubits and the computational resonator. We benchmark the QPU performance and achieve a genuinely multi-qubit entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state over all six qubits with a readout-error mitigated fidelity of $0.86$.</p>

            <h2>Bridging wire and gate cutting with ZX-calculus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Schumann, Tobias Stollenwerk, Alessandro Ciani</p>
            <p>Quantum circuit cutting refers to a series of techniques that allow one to partition a quantum computation on a large quantum computer into several quantum computations on smaller devices. This usually comes at the price of a sampling overhead, that is quantified by the $1$-norm of the associated decomposition. The applicability of these techniques relies on the possibility of finding decompositions of the ideal, global unitaries into quantum operations that can be simulated onto each sub-register, which should ideally minimize the $1$-norm. In this work, we show how these decompositions can be obtained diagrammatically using ZX-calculus expanding on the work of Ufrecht et al. [arXiv:2302.00387]. The central idea of our work is that since in ZX-calculus only connectivity matters, it should be possible to cut wires in ZX-diagrams by inserting known decompositions of the identity in standard quantum circuits. We show how, using this basic idea, many of the gate decompositions known in the literature can be re-interpreted as an instance of wire cuts in ZX-diagrams. Furthermore, we obtain improved decompositions for multi-qubit controlled-Z (MCZ) gates with $1$-norm equal to $3$ for any number of qubits and any partition, which we argue to be optimal. Our work gives new ways of thinking about circuit cutting that can be particularly valuable for finding decompositions of large unitary gates. Besides, it sheds light on the question of why exploiting classical communication decreases the 1-norm of a wire cut but does not do so for certain gate decompositions. In particular, using wire cuts with classical communication, we obtain gate decompositions that do not require classical communication.</p>

            <p>Sharing logical entangled pairs between distant quantum nodes is a key process to achieve fault tolerant quantum computation and communication. However, there is a gap between current experimental specifications and theoretical requirements for sharing logical entangled states while improving experimental techniques. Here, we propose an efficient logical entanglement distribution protocol based on surface codes for two distant 2D qubit array with nearest-neighbor interaction. A notable feature of our protocol is that it allows post-selection according to error estimations, which provides the tunability between the infidelity of logical entanglements and the success probability of the protocol. With this feature, the fidelity of encoded logical entangled states can be improved by sacrificing success rates. We numerically evaluated the performance of our protocol and the trade-off relationship, and found that our protocol enables us to prepare logical entangled states while improving fidelity in feasible experimental parameters. We also discuss a possible physical implementation using neutral atom arrays to show the feasibility of our protocol.</p>

            <p>A protocol involving the repetitive (twofold, to be precise) application of PBT protocol to the same resource is studied. The quantities characterizing the resulting protocol, so-called \textit{two-step PBT}, namely \textit{enatnglement fidelity} and \textit{success probability} are provided for two scenarios, relying on application of pretty-good measurement, i.e. deterministic and probabilistic PBT with non-EPR resource. This results show that two-step PBT is an accurate protocol, provided the resource is sufficiently large. In particular, the deterministic two-step PBT obtains fidelity that is remarkably close to the optimal MPBT fidelity for teleportation of two quantum states. Additionally, the \textit{recycling fidelity}, i.e. the quantity characterizing the degradation of the resource state is calculated for repetitive application of probabilistic protocol, for both EPR and optimized resource, showing that entanglement recycling with two-step PBT is possible in the former case as well.</p>

            <h2>Q-Cluster: Quantum Error Mitigation Through Noise-Aware Unsupervised Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hrushikesh Pramod Patil, Dror Baron, Huiyang Zhou</p>
            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical in reducing the impact of noise in the pre-fault-tolerant era, and is expected to complement error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). In this paper, we propose a novel QEM approach, Q-Cluster, that uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to reshape the measured bit-string distribution. Our approach starts with a simplified bit-flip noise model. It first performs clustering on noisy measurement results, i.e., bit-strings, based on the Hamming distance. The centroid of each cluster is calculated using a qubit-wise majority vote. Next, the noisy distribution is adjusted with the clustering outcomes and the bit-flip error rates using Bayesian inference. Our simulation results show that Q-Cluster can mitigate high noise rates (up to 40% per qubit) with the simple bit-flip noise model. However, real quantum computers do not fit such a simple noise model. To address the problem, we (a) apply Pauli twirling to tailor the complex noise channels to Pauli errors, and (b) employ a machine learning model, ExtraTrees regressor, to estimate an effective bit-flip error rate using a feature vector consisting of machine calibration data (gate & measurement error rates), circuit features (number of qubits, numbers of different types of gates, etc.) and the shape of the noisy distribution (entropy). Our experimental results show that our proposed Q-Cluster scheme improves the fidelity by a factor of 1.46x, on average, compared to the unmitigated output distribution, for a set of low-entropy benchmarks on five different IBM quantum machines. Our approach outperforms the state-of-art QEM approaches M3 [24], Hammer [35], and QBEEP [33] by 1.29x, 1.47x, and 2.65x, respectively.</p>

This combined system achieves full controllability and exhibits enhanced performance for nanoscale magnetic sensing, including an improved dynamic range. Moreover, we investigate the rich many-body spin dynamics within the hybrid system, which enables us to estimate the concentration of V_B^- spins.

This mechanism further facilitates remote generation of W-class entangled states. Our results thereby open exciting possibilities for quantum networks and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Heterogeneously error-corrected QRAMs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ansh Singal, Kaitlin N. Smith</p>
            <p>Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) holds the promise of enabling several large scale applications of quantum computers. However, designing fault tolerant QRAMs for large scale applications is still an open problem due to the poor error and resource scaling of current architectures. Existing protocols often overlook the need for error correcting QRAMs, which will be required for data-intensive, fault-tolerant applications. However, naively error correcting all qubits used to implement the QRAM is prohibitively resource intensive, quickly becoming infeasible for large applications. To fill this gap, we propose a novel QRAM architecture that leverages variable strength error correction. We strongly error-correct qubits that heavily influence query fidelity, and lightly correct less critical regions of the QRAM. This scheme produces queries with fidelity bounded by a constant for arbitrarily sized QRAMs without requiring improvements in physical hardware. Furthermore, the heterogeneous scheme requires 5x fewer resources (for depth 30 QRAM) and quadratically slower error scaling as compared to a uniformly error corrected Bucket Brigade QRAM. In this work, we present a rigorous analysis of the query fidelity scaling and perform resource analyses of two variations of the heterogeneous architecture using the surface code. We verify our results using numerical simulations and compare our results against several other existing QRAM techniques. Through our results, we quantitatively prove the optimal scaling of the heterogeneous architecture, paving a way for data-intensive and fault tolerant quantum applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate a one-dimensional quantum system with a self-similar arrangement of delta-function potential barriers, exhibiting discrete scale invariance. The singular potential induces kinematically enforced symmetry breaking at $x=0$, decoupling the positive and negative spatial regions and leading to non-symmetric zero-energy states. We demonstrate that the system supports a unique zero-energy wavefunction, which, though not square-integrable, decays to zero at infinity and acts as a bound-like state with self-similar properties under discrete scaling transformations, akin to Efimov physics but limited to a single state. In momentum space, this wavefunction exhibits a threshold singularity at low momenta, with behavior depending on the scaling exponent $\alpha$:power-law divergence and log-periodic modulations for $0 < \alpha < 1$, logarithmic divergence for $\alpha = 1$, and a finite limit for $\alpha > 1$, which may be observable through time-of-flight or spectroscopic measurements in cold atom experiments. The system's continuous spectrum, starting at zero energy, lacks discrete bound states. These findings highlight the role of singular potentials in generating scale-invariant quantum phenomena and provide a minimal framework for studying discrete scale symmetry and its potential experimental signatures.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieving a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here, we combine the capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and be used for quantum information processing, thereby largely overcoming the issue of detection losses. While utilising the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $\SI{39}{\nV\per\cm \hertz\tothe{-1/2}}$ sensitivity, we employ inter-atomic dipolar interactions to take advantage of an error-prevention protocol that protects information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the protocol's idea is based on introducing an additional non-linear, lossy quantum channel, which results in a 3.3-fold enhancement of Fisher information. The presented results pave the way for broader adoption of quantum-information-inspired enhancements enabled by intrinsic interactions present in a sensor system, and more broadly in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</p>

            <p>Qubit control protocols have traditionally leveraged a characterisation of the qubit-bath coupling via its power spectral density. Previous work proposed the inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical bath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with physics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges in scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural networks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an efficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the \textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled bath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature space provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the presence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the input space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this case), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the broad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how control pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space.</p>

            <h2>Insightful Approach to Quantum Noise Suppression Below the Standard Quantum Limit Using a Single Mirror and Beam Splitter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun-Hyun Youn</p>
            <p>When a coherent electromagnetic wave passes through a beam splitter (BS), it is divided equally into two parts. However, the quantum noise associated with the resulting coherent states, despite being reduced in amplitude by half, remains fundamentally constrained by the quantum noise limit, independent of the intensity. By placing a mirror at the unused input port of the BS, a standing wave is formed in the vicinity of the mirror, which influences the vacuum fluctuations of the coherent state at the BS output. Using semi-classical and quantum mechanical approaches, we calculate the vacuum fluctuations induced by the mirror and demonstrate that the vacuum noise originating from the mirror side periodically reaches zero at the BS output. Leveraging this effect, we show that the vacuum fluctuations of the light split by the BS can be readily reduced below the quantum noise limit. Furthermore, through feedback mechanisms, the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field at the other output port can also be suppressed below the quantum noise limit. These findings provide a pivotal insight into the manipulation of electromagnetic noise, with broad implications for all experiments involving quantum noise control.</p>

We show that a square root law (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical communication: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more practical for physical implementation.</p>

            <p>The learning of the physical world relies on sensing and data post-processing. When the signals are weak, multidimensional and correlated, the performance of learning is often bottlenecked by the quality of sensors, calling for integrating quantum sensing into the learning of such physical-layer data. An example of such a learning scenario is the stochastic quadrature displacements of electromagnetic fields, modeling optomechanical force sensing, radiofrequency photonic sensing, microwave cavity weak signal sensing, and other applications. We propose a unified protocol that combines machine learning with interferometric photon counting to reduce noise and reveal correlations. By applying variational quantum learning with multimode programmable quantum measurements, we enhance signal extraction. Our results show that multimode interferometric photon counting outperforms conventional homodyne detection proposed in prior works for tasks like principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-correlation analysis (CCA), even below vacuum noise levels. To further enhance the performance, we also integrate entanglement-enhanced modules, in the form of squeezed state distribution and anti-squeezing at detection, into the protocol. Combining multimode interferometric photon counting and multipartite entanglement, the proposed protocol provides a powerful toolbox for learning weak signals.</p>

            <p>In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.</p>

            <p>Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian de Correc, Thomas Ayral, Corentin Bertrand</p>
            <p>Analog quantum computing with Rydberg atoms is seen as an avenue to solve hard graph optimization problems, because they naturally encode the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on Unit-Disk (UD) graphs, a problem that admits rather efficient approximation schemes on classical computers. Going beyond UD-MIS to address generic graphs requires embedding schemes, typically with chains of ancilla atoms, and an interpretation algorithm to map results back to the original problem. However, interpreting approximate solutions obtained with realistic quantum computers proves to be a difficult problem. As a case study, we evaluate the ability of two interpretation strategies to correct errors in the recently introduced Crossing Lattice embedding. We find that one strategy, based on finding the closest embedding solution, leads to very high qualities, albeit at an exponential cost. The second strategy, based on ignoring defective regions of the embedding graph, is polynomial in the graph size, but it leads to a degradation of the solution quality which is prohibitive under realistic assumptions on the defect generation. Moreover, more favorable defect scalings lead to a contradiction with well-known approximability conjectures. Therefore, it is unlikely that a scalable and generic improvement in solution quality can be achieved with Rydberg platforms -- thus moving the focus to heuristic algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Extended parameter shift rules with minimal derivative variance for parameterized quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijian Lai, Jiang Hu, Dong An, Zaiwen Wen</p>
            <p>Parameter shift rules (PSRs) are useful methods for computing arbitrary-order derivatives of the cost function in parameterized quantum circuits. The basic idea of PSRs is to evaluate the cost function at different parameter shifts, then use specific coefficients to combine them linearly to obtain the exact derivatives. In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR) which generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two advantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts, allowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final derivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative estimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the PSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate $U(x) = \exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs are valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words. Additionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by Wierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it yields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the weighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter shifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Seniority-based Subspace Expansion: Linear Combinations of Short-Circuit Unitary Transformations for the Electronic Structure Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Smik Patel, Praveen Jayakumar, Rick Huang, Tao Zeng, Artur F. Izmaylov</p>
            <p>Quantum SENiority-based Subspace Expansion (Q-SENSE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that interpolates between the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Configuration Interaction (CI) methods. It constructs Hamiltonian matrix elements on a quantum device and solves the resulting eigenvalue problem classically. Unlike other expansion-based methods -- such as Quantum Subspace Expansion (QSE), Quantum Krylov Algorithms, and the Non-Orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver -- Q-SENSE introduces seniority operators as artificial symmetries to construct orthogonal basis states. This seniority-symmetry-based approach reduces one of the primary limitations of VQE on near-term quantum hardware -- circuit depth -- at the cost of measuring additional matrix elements. The artificial symmetries also reduce the number of Hamiltonian terms that must be measured, as only a small fraction of the terms couple basis states in different seniority subspaces. With all these merits, Q-SENSE offers a scalable and resource-efficient route to quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices and in the early fault-tolerant regime.</p>

            <h2>A method for the numerical analysis of hybrid lumped-distributed superconducting quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simona Zaccaria, Antonio Gnudi</p>
            <p>We present a method for the numerical analysis of superconducting quantum circuits combining lumped elements, either linear or non-linear (i.e.~Josephson junctions), and distributed coplanar waveguide (CPW) structures. CPW transmission lines and multiline couplers are directly modeled without discretizing them into lumped-element equivalents, and the circuit Hamiltonian parameters are extracted by using the energy participation ratio (EPR) method. This approach enables fast and accurate extraction of mode frequencies, anharmonicities, cross-Kerr interactions, and Purcell decay rates without relying on full electromagnetic simulations, while naturally accounting for higher-order modes of distributed components. We have implemented the proposed method in a Python framework, QuLTRA (Quantum hybrid Lumped and TRansmission lines circuits Analyzer), which we have used to validate the approach against full electromagnetic simulations (Ansys HFSS, pyEPR), existing circuit-analysis tools (QuCAT), and designs reported in the literature. The comparisons show excellent agreement with orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational time relative to full-wave solvers. We demonstrate applications including Purcell-protected readout, multimode ultra-strong coupling, and multiplexed qubit readout, illustrating how the method can support fast and reliable early-stage circuit design.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Discord of any arbitrary dimensional bipartite system and its application in quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashi Jain, Satyabrata Adhikari</p>
            <p>Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role in the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, if the shared resource state is an entangled state constructed with the linear combination of the tensor product of the Bell pair and the state $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$, then we have shown that under some assumption on $\sigma_i$'s, the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ can be expressed in terms of GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$. Thus, the distillable key rate depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, when the communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in presence of an eavesdropper. Further, for a certain range of GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, we find that there exists some NPT entangled resource state for which the successful generation of the secret key may not be guaranteed. We, moreover study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples.</p>

            <h2>A Modular, Adaptive, and Scalable Quantum Factoring Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.</p>

            <p>We present a microscopic derivation of a master equation for two-component bosons (bosonic qubits) which tunnel between spatially separated modes under local dephasing noise. Starting from the full system-bath Hamiltonian with Lorentzian coupling distributions, we analytically obtain a time-local master equation whose structure reveals intrinsic non-Markovian features and recovers the standard phenomenological dephasing model in the short-time limit. Comparison with exact pseudomode simulations confirms its validity beyond weak-coupling and Markovian regimes. We identify a resonance condition between tunneling and bath frequencies for which dephasing drives the system towards correlated steady states, stabilizing coherence and entanglement instead of suppressing them. These results establish a rigorous microscopic foundation for dephasing models in bosonic tunneling systems and reveal a noise-induced mechanism for steady-state entanglement.</p>

            <p>Having multiple Bell pairs shared by distant quantum registers provides a key resource for both quantum networks and distributed quantum computing. In this paper, we present a protocol for parallelized Bell-pair generation that uses the phase of a coherent light pulse to encode a qudit, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple Bell pairs. By encoding a qudit in a basis of light-matter Schrödinger's cat states, the loss of a photon in transit can be detected through an $XX$ parity syndrome, allowing the backaction due to the lost photon to be deterministically corrected through single-qubit rotations. The protocol presented here is compatible with existing technologies in both optical and microwave (circuit QED) architectures, supporting near-term implementation across diverse quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin Player</p>
            <p>The Unruh effect, central to quantum field theory in curved spacetime, states that uniformly accelerated observers perceive the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal ensemble of Rindler excitations. Building on this foundation and drawing analogies from squeezing in quantum optics, we investigate how entangled, non-thermal excitations generated by bilocal driving sources contribute to the accelerated response. These paired excitations act as inertial microstates within the thermal Unruh ensemble, suggesting that portions of the effect can be interpreted as source-driven. To capture this, we employ modular automorphisms from algebraic QFT to track localization of modes and observers across nested Rindler wedges. We then construct compact wave-packet approximations using parabolic cylinder functions, providing a smooth interpolation between wedge-supported thermal modes and fully localized non-thermal excitations. This approach situates the Unruh response within a broader framework where standard thermality emerges alongside, and sometimes from, localized source-induced structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Praveen Jayakumar, Tao Zeng, Artur F. Izmaylov</p>
            <p>Exact unitary transformations play a central role in the analysis and simulation of many-body quantum systems, yet the conditions under which they can be carried out exactly and efficiently remain incompletely understood. We show that exact transformations arise whenever the adjoint action of a unitary's generator defines a linear map within a finite-dimensional operator space. In this regime, there exists a finite-degree polynomial that annihilates the adjoint map, rendering the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion finite. We identify the role of Lie algebras and their modules in producing finite BCH expansions in all known cases. This perspective brings together previously disparate examples of exact transformations under a single unifying principle and clarifies how algebraic relations between generators and transformed operators determine the polynomial degree of the transformation. We illustrate this framework for previously known cases of efficient unitary transformations including unitary coupled-cluster and Pauli product generators. Using this framework, we propose a new class of fermionic generators that can be used for efficient transformations. The result establishes sufficient algebraic conditions for when exact unitary transformations are possible and provides new strategies for reducing their computational cost in quantum simulation and constructing feasible unitary transformations.</p>

To accelerate design workflows, we develop a physics-informed machine learning surrogate trained on the simulation data, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields. By addressing the multiscale and multiphysics challenges in magnon-photon modeling, our framework enables scalable simulation and rapid prototyping of next-generation quantum and spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Heinrich, Jonas Haferkamp, Ingo Roth, Jonas Helsen</p>
            <p>Until very recently, it was generally believed that the (approximate) 2-design property is strictly stronger than anti-concentration of random quantum circuits, mainly because it was shown that the latter anti-concentrate in logarithmic depth, while the former generally need linear depth circuits. This belief was disproven by recent results which show that so-called relative-error approximate unitary designs can in fact be generated in logarithmic depth, implying anti-concentration. Their result does however not apply to ordinary local random circuits, a gap which we close in this paper, at least for 2-designs. More precisely, we show that anti-concentration of local random quantum circuits already implies that they form relative-error approximate state 2-designs, making them equivalent properties for these ensembles. Our result holds more generally for any random circuit which is invariant under local (single-qubit) unitaries, independent of the architecture.</p>

            <p>Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a novel class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional columnar dimerized Heisenberg model. Notably, the observed transitions do not fall into any previously established universality classes. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional systems. In addition, the representation provides a natural interpretation of the phase transitions in terms of cluster formation within the simulations. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum circuits are considered more powerful than classical circuits and require exponential resources to simulate classically. Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Abu-Nada, Aryan Iliat, Russell Ceballos</p>
            <p>Amplitude damping fundamentally limits qubit lifetimes by irreversibly leaking energy and information into the environment. Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \(T_1 = 50~\mu\mathrm{s}\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \(\sim 3\!-\!4\times\) longer \(T_1\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy. The method is modular and hardware-compatible: ancilla coupling and supervised prediction can be added to existing W--M loops to convert leaked information into a precise, time-advanced corrective drive. We also include a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective rates for both ancilla-assisted and prediction-enhanced feedback, making the impact of each design element analytically transparent.</p>

            <p>Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to variable qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.</p>

            <p>High-performance single-photon detectors (SPDs) are indispensable components for a wide range of quantum optical applications. However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and necessitates challenging operational conditions, such as cryogenics, thereby hindering scalable implementation. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of conventional room-temperature SPDs. Relying entirely on non-superconducting components and eliminating cryogenic cooling requirements, the ESPD scheme can upgrade a legacy SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) of $10^{-2}$, to a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE exceeding $93\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This performance rivals or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Although the architecture requires substantial integration effort, the scheme can provide superconducting-level performance without cryogenic cooling, offering a clear path toward the widespread deployment of high-performance SPDs as well as related quantum technologies in infrastructure-constrained environments.</p>

            <p>The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.</p>

            <p>We study two entanglement measures in a large family of isotropic many-body states including incompressible quantum Hall liquids and quantum critical systems: the logarithmic negativity (LN), and mutual information (MI). For pure states, obtained for example from a bipartition at zero temperature, these provide distinct characterizations of the entanglement present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first obtain general non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the LN and MI. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations, where super-universal angle dependence holds allowing for explicit checks. For the MI, we make stronger statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions. We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space lattice discretization. At finite temperature, we find a rapid decrease of the LN well inside the cyclotron gap at integer fillings. We further show that the LN decays faster compared to the MI at high temperatures.</p>

            <p>Relaxed quantum systems with conservation laws are believed to be approximated by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), which incorporates the constraints of certain conserved quantities serving as integrals of motion. By drawing an analogy between eigenstate reduced density matrix and GGE, we conjecture that a natural set of conserved quantities for GGE can emerge from the reduced density matrices of properly chosen eigenstates by the entanglement Hamiltonian superdensity matrix (EHSM) framework, and we demonstrate this explicitly for models mappable to free fermions. The framework proposes that such conserved quantities are linear superpositions of eigenstate entanglement Hamiltonians of a larger auxiliary system, where the eigenstates are Fock states occupying what we call the common eigenmodes, which remain eigenmodes when truncated within the physical subsystem. For 1D homogeneous free fermions with (anti-)periodic boundary conditions, which maps to 1D hardcore bosons with nearest neighbor hoppings, these conserved quantities lead to a non-Abelian GGE, which predicts the relaxation of both fermion and boson bilinears more accurately than the conventional Abelian GGE. Generalization of this framework may provide novel numerical insights for quantum integrability.</p>

            <p>We study the strong-field limit of a theory involving a quantum scalar field coupled to a vector background, which can be either an electromagnetic field or a non-gauge field coupled through the first derivative term. Our approach consists in obtaining resummed expressions for the associated heat kernels, from which we derive the corresponding resummed effective actions. These results allow us to discuss the effect of pair creation. Finally, we conjecture that resummations for more general theories should be possible.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning of the Ising model on a spherical Fibonacci lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Zhou, Chen-Hui Song, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo</p>
            <p>We investigate the Ising model on a spherical surface, utilizing a Fibonacci lattice to approximate uniform coverage. This setup poses challenges in achieving consistent lattice distribution across the sphere for comparison with planar models. We employ Monte Carlo simulations, principal component analysis (PCA), graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to study spin configurations across a range of temperatures and to determine phase transition temperatures. The Fibonacci lattice, despite its uniformity, contains irregular sites that influence spin behavior. In the ferromagnetic case, sites with fewer neighbors exhibit a higher tendency for spin flips at low temperatures, though this effect weakens as temperature increases, leading to a higher phase transition temperature than in the planar Ising model. In the antiferromagnetic case, lattice irregularities induce geometric frustration, resulting in highly degenerate ground states and the phase transition temperature lower than the planar square lattice. Phase transition temperatures are derived through specific heat, magnetic susceptibility analysis and GCNs predictions, yielding $T_c$ values for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic scenarios. This work emphasizes the impact of the Fibonacci lattice's geometric properties-namely curvature and connectivity-on spin interactions in non-planar systems, with relevance to microgravity environments.</p>

            <h2>Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Paeckel</p>
            <p>The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Green's functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta \omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta \omega = 2\pi/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome by augmenting the time series with complex-time Krylov states. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Aikawa, Takeshi Morita</p>
            <p>Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Jin, Nana Liu, Chuwen Ma, Yizhe Peng, Yue Yu</p>
            <p>The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schrödingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</p>

            <p>Solid-state platforms based on bosonic quasiparticles offer a compelling route toward on-chip quantum information technologies scalable to nanometer dimensions. Coherence time, a key figure of merit for any quantum system, is fundamentally limited by the lifetime of quasiparticles that store quantum information. For magnons - bosonic excitations of collective magnetization dynamics - it has long been reported that their lifetime does not exceed a few hundred nanoseconds, placing a stringent constraint on their use in quantum architectures. Here, we demonstrate magnon lifetimes exceeding 18 {\mu}s. Experiments performed on single-crystal yttrium iron garnet spheres cooled to 30 mK reveal relaxation times of short-wavelength magnons nearly two orders of magnitude longer than previously observed. These findings overturn the established view of magnon dissipation limits, positioning magnons as viable, long-lived information carriers for solid-state quantum computing.</p>

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p>

            <p>Exploring novel topological matters with exotic quantum states has always been a core issue in the field of condensed matter physics, which can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single band gap. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from the well-known first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Particularly, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and discover a three-dimensional unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both helical and corner topological states and exhibits an unprecedented bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adit Vishnu, Abhay Shastry, Dhruva Kashyap, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>Machine learning with density operators, the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics, is gaining prominence with rapid advances in quantum computing. Generative models based on density operators cannot yet handle tasks that are routinely handled by probabilistic models. The progress of latent variable models, a broad and influential class of probabilistic unsupervised models, was driven by the Expectation-Maximization framework. Deriving such a framework for density operators is challenging due to the non-commutativity of operators. To tackle this challenge, an inequality arising from the monotonicity of relative entropy is demonstrated to serve as an evidence lower bound for density operators. A minorant-maximization perspective on this bound leads to Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM), a general framework for training latent variable models defined through density operators. Through an information-geometric argument, the Expectation step in DO-EM is shown to be the Petz recovery map. The DO-EM algorithm is applied to Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines, adapting Contrastive Divergence to approximate the Maximization step gradient. Quantum interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines and Quantum Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machines, new models introduced in this work, outperform their probabilistic counterparts on generative tasks when trained with similar computational resources and identical hyperparameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shusei Wadashima, Yukitoshi Motome</p>
            <p>Spin-liquid and spin-glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remains challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin-liquid and spin-glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among p spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size N dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of p. We show that the phase diagrams for different p can be unified through a scaling with N/p2, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin-liquid phase and extends the spin-glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin-liquid phase transitions into the spin-glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.</p>

To each stabilizer state restricted to half-space geometry we associate a boundary operator module. Boundary operator modules provide examples of quasi-symplectic modules, which are objects of independent mathematical interest. In their study, we use ideas from algebraic L-theory in a setting involving non-projective modules and non-unimodular forms. Our results about quasi-symplectic modules in one spatial dimension allow us to resolve the conjecture that every stabilizer state in two dimensions is characterized by a corresponding abelian anyon model with gappable boundary. Our techniques are also applicable beyond two dimensions, such as in the study of fractons.</p>

            <p>The simplest, algebraic quantum-electrodynamical corrections, due to the double-negative energy subspace and instantaneous interactions, are computed to the no-pair energy of two-spin-1/2-fermion systems. Numerical results are reported for two-electron atoms with a clamped nucleus and positronium-like genuine two-particle systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian. The numerical results have an $\alpha$ fine-structure constant dependence that is in excellent agreement with the known $\alpha^3E_\mathrm{h}\$-order double-pair correction of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>Accurate evaluation of nonlinear photonic integrated circuits requires separating input and output coupling efficiencies (i.e., $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$), yet the conventional linear-transmission calibration method recovers only their product (i.e., $\eta_1\,\eta_2$) and therefore introduces systematic bias when inferring on-chip performance from off-chip data. We present bidirectional nonlinear optical tomography (BNOT), a direction-aware metrology that uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes, with process-appropriate detection, to break the ``degeneracy'' of $\eta_1\,\eta_2$ and estimate individual interface efficiencies with tight confidence intervals. The method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities through a compact observation model that explicitly incorporates pump fluctuations and detector noise, and it frames efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization. Monte Carlo studies show unbiased convergence of the estimated efficiencies to ground truth with low error across realistic operating regimes. Using these efficiency estimates to reconstruct on-chip nonlinear figures of merit yields distributions centered on the true values with reduced variance, whereas conventional ``degenerate'' calibration is biased and can substantially misestimate on-chip performance. BNOT is hardware-compatible and platform-agnostic, and provides unbiased characterization of off- and on-chip coupling efficiencies across nonlinear processes, enabling reproducible, coupling-resolved benchmarking for scalable systems in quantum optics, frequency conversion, and precision metrology.</p>

            <h2>On the Capacity of Erasure-prone Quantum Storage with Erasure-prone Entanglement Assistance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Sun, Syed A. Jafar</p>
            <p>A quantum message is encoded into $N$ storage nodes (quantum systems $Q_1\dots Q_N$) with assistance from $N_B$ maximally entangled bi-partite quantum systems $A_1B_1, \dots, A_{N_B}B_{N_B}$, that are prepared in advance such that $B_1\dots B_{N_B}$ are stored separately as entanglement assistance (EA) nodes, while $A_1\dots A_{N_B}$ are made available to the encoder. Both the storage nodes and EA nodes are erasure-prone. The quantum message must be recoverable given any $K$ of the $N$ storage nodes along with any $K_B$ of the $N_B$ EA nodes. The capacity for this setting is the maximum size of the quantum message, given that the size of each EA node is $\lambda_B$. All node sizes are relative to the size of a storage node, which is normalized to unity. The exact capacity is characterized as a function of $N,K,N_B,K_B, \lambda_B$ in all cases, with one exception. The capacity remains open for an intermediate range of $\lambda_B$ values when a strict majority of the $N$ storage nodes, and a strict non-zero minority of the $N_B$ EA nodes, are erased. As a key stepping stone, an analogous classical storage (with shared-randomness assistance) problem is introduced. A set of constraints is identified for the classical problem, such that classical linear code constructions translate to quantum storage codes, and the converse bounds for the two settings utilize similar insights. In particular, the capacity characterizations for the classical and quantum settings are shown to be identical in all cases where the capacity is settled.</p>

Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath. The system is formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics.

            <p>We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>State transfer between light and microwaves is a key challenge in quantum networks. Promising transducers use a mechanical intermediary that couples to both fields via radiation pressure. Such electro-optomechanical devices have achieved high efficiencies, yet require resolved-sideband cavities, and generally compromise in scalability and noise performance. Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities. Our results unlock a new design space for electro-optomechanical transducers and strengthens their candidacy as scalable quantum links between distant nodes.</p>

            <h2>Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charlie-Ray Mann, Mark A. Oehlgrien, Błażej Jaworowski, Giuseppe Calajó, Jamir Marino, Kyung S. Choi, Darrick E. Chang</p>
            <p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum open system description of a hybrid plasmonic cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Vallone</p>
            <p>We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.</p>

            <h2>Quantum correlated steady states under competing collective and individual decay</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikita Leppenen, Ephraim Shahmoon</p>
            <p>Collective dissipation can generate useful quantum correlations, while ubiquitous individual decay destroys them. We study the interplay between these two competing processes considering a driven system of many spins (``atoms") undergoing both collective and individual dissipation (``radiation"). In steady state and depending on drive, we find that the system exhibits a first-order phase transition and quantum bistability: its quantum state is a mixture of two many-body states associated with the two competing decay processes. Accordingly, one of these states closely resembles a correlated ``coherently radiating spin state" (CRSS) -- the solution of purely collective dissipation -- exhibiting spin-squeezing entanglement. We predict dynamical switching between the two stable states, manifest as many-body quantum jumps in the various observables of spin and radiation. Macroscopically, the switching rate tends to vanish and the system can reside in a correlated CRSS for long times. This reveals how correlated dissipative physics emerges at the presence of decorrelating individual decay, opening a path for unlocking collective dissipation phenomena in realistic quantum platforms and applications. We discuss consequences for experiments in collective radiation.</p>

            <p>We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate in a Majorana-encoded logical space simulated on a photonic platform. Instead of implementing physical Majorana quasiparticles, our experiment emulates the algebra of Majorana zero modes using photonic degrees of freedom obtained through a Jordan-Wigner mapping. This mapping enables us to simulate two logical qubits, encoded in three Kitaev chains supporting endpoint Majorana operators. Moreover, we realise the unitary representations of both intra-chain and inter-chain Majorana braiding operations that implement the encoded CNOT gate. Due to hardware constraints, the full braiding sequence is executed through a cyclic input-output procedure, requiring an indirect reconstruction of accumulated noise across successive steps. We numerically show that the Majorana encoding offers resilience to the dominant noise in our photonic setup, provided the physical error rate stays below a well-defined threshold. As our experimental error rate (p=0.012) lies beneath this threshold, the experimentally measured encoded CNOT fidelity is significantly enhanced, exceeding 0.992. This reveals a novel pathway to fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Majorana-inspired encodings, even in the absence of full topological protection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline Lima, María Rosa Preciado-Rivas, Sanchit Srivastava</p>
            <p>Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, describes systems in which the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, in contrast to classical hidden-variable descriptions. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that localized interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results show that contextuality is a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum and establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Qi, Yuan Xue</p>
            <p>Exactly solvable dissipative models provide an analytical tool for studying the relaxation dynamics in open quantum systems. In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting Movable Logical Qubits for Lattice Surgery Compilation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura S. Herzog, Lucas Berent, Aleksander Kubica, Robert Wille</p>
            <p>Lattice surgery with two-dimensional quantum error correcting codes is among the leading schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation, motivated by superconducting hardware architectures. In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware. An open-source implementation of our method is available on GitHub this https URL.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Gate Architecture via Teleportation and Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel J. Sheldon, Pieter Kok, Callum W. Duncan</p>
            <p>We present a universal quantum computing architecture which combines the measurement-driven aspect of MBQC with the circuit model's algorithm dependent generation of qubit entanglement. Our architecture, which we call QGATE, is tailored for discrete-variable photonic quantum computers with deterministic photon sources capable of generating 1D entangled photonic states. QGATE achieves universal quantum computing on a logical data qubit register via the implementation of Clifford operations, QGATE ancilla, and arbitrary angle single-qubit measurements. We realise unitary evolutions defined by multi-qubit Pauli strings via the generation of entanglement between a sub-set of logical qubits and a mutual QGATE ancilla qubit. Measurement of the QGATE ancilla in the appropriate basis then implements a given term of the desired unitary operation. This enables QGATE to both directly perform Hamiltonian evolutions in terms of a series of multi-qubit Pauli operators, in terms of projectors for an arbitrary sparse Hamiltonian, or realise multi-controlled gates enabling direct translation of circuit models to QGATE. We consider examples inspired by quantum chemistry and computational fluid dynamics. We propose an example photonic implementation of QGATE and calculate thresholds of $10.36\pm0.02\%$ or $25.98\pm0.28\%$ on the photonic loss for logical qubits constructed from foliated rotated surface codes, dependent on the deployment of intra-layer or inter-layer fusion respectively.</p>

            <p>Temporal modes of quantum light pulses is a promising resource for modern quantum technologies, driving advancements in quantum computing, communication, and metrology. Precise control and manipulation of these modes remain critical challenges, particularly in systems where nonlinear multimode dynamics interact with dispersion effects. In this work, we focus on the role of group velocity dispersion (GVD) within optical cavities - a phenomenon traditionally viewed as detrimental but increasingly recognized as a versatile tool for quantum light manipulation. We present a perturbation-theory-based approach to analyze GVD effects in a synchronously pumped dispersive cavity. By comparing perturbative solutions to rigorous steady-state results, we establish the validity region of the perturbative approach and assess its limitations in multimode systems. Our study identifies key parameters governing the breakdown of perturbation theory, such as mode order, dispersion strength, and cavity decay rates.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT transparency window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Rydberg RF receiver. This experimental validation highlights the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing to overcome the inherent bandwidth and sensitivity limitations of bare Rydberg receivers for a variety of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.</p>

            <h2>Universal quantum control over non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu-yao Jin, Jun Jing</p>
            <p>Although the control of non-Hermitian quantum systems has a growing interest for their nonunitary feature in the time evolution, the existing discussions are not more than two or three dimensions and heavily influenced by the singularity of the energy spectrum. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion. Our work essentially extends the universal quantum control (UQC) theory to the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, providing a promising approach for their coherent control.</p>

            <p>Accurate computation of non-covalent, intermolecular interaction energies is important to understand various chemical phenomena, and quantum computers are anticipated to accelerate it. Although the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and intermediate-scale ones, development of theoretical frameworks those are expected to work on a fault-tolerant quantum computer is an urgent issue. In this work, we explore resource-efficient implementation of the quantum phase estimation-based complete active space configuration interaction (QPE-CASCI) calculations, with the aid of the second-order Møller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)-based active space selection with Boys localized orbitals. We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Preliminary results on quantum circuit compression for QPE are also presented to reduce the number of two-qubit gates and depth.</p>

            <p>In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.</p>

            <p>Recently proposed metastability-induced quantum batteries have shown particular promise for coherent microwave generation. However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources.</p>

We implement a noise-aware pulse selection strategy to identify candidate protocols with reduced susceptibility to certain noise sources, then analyze their performance under realistic noise sources -- including atomic motion, Rydberg decay, and experimentally motivated laser phase and intensity noise. For a $^{88}$Sr-based architecture, we demonstrate fast iSWAP gate protocols which exceed fidelities of $99.9\%$ under realistic experimental conditions.

            <p>Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.</p>

            <p>Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel J. Sheldon, Pieter Kok</p>
            <p>Measurement-based quantum computing relies on the generation of large entangled cluster states that act as a universal resource on which logical circuits can be imprinted and executed through local measurements. A number of strategies for constructing sufficiently large photonic cluster states propose fusing many smaller resource states generated by a series of quantum emitters. However, the fusion process is inherently probabilistic with a 50% success probability in standard guise. A recent proposal has shown that, in the limit of low loss, the probability of achieving successful fusion may be boosted to near unity by redundantly encoding the vertices of linear graph states using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states [Quantum 7, 992 (2023)].

            <h2>Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Gardin, Emilio Cobanera, Giuseppe C. Tettamanzi</p>
            <p>The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.</p>

            <p>Scaling quantum computers to large sizes requires the implementation of many parallel qubit readouts. Here we present an ultrastable superconducting-qubit readout method using the multi-tone self-phase-referenced Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique, originally developed for use with optical cavities. In this work, we benchmark PDH readout of a single transmon qubit, using room-temperature heterodyne detection of all tones to reconstruct the PDH signal. We demonstrate that PDH qubit readout is insensitive to microwave phase drift, displaying $0.73^\circ$ phase stability over 2 hours, and capable of single-shot readout in the presence of phase errors exceeding the phase shift induced by the qubit state. We show that the PDH sideband tones do not cause unwanted measurement-induced state transitions for a transmon qubit, leading to a potential signal enhancement of at least $14$~dB over traditional heterodyne readout.</p>

            <h2>Excess work in counterdiabatic driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas P. Kamizaki, Marcus V. S. Bonança</p>
            <p>Many years have passed since the conception of the quintessential method of shortcut to adiabaticity known as counterdiabatic driving (or transitionless quantum driving). Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun Tang, Haoxuan Chen, Yuehaw Khoo, Lexing Ying</p>
            <p>We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ching-Tai Huang, Yu-Cheng Lin, Ferenc Igloi</p>
            <p>We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order Rényi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danial Davoudi, Abdul Mohamed, Shabir Barzanjeh</p>
            <p>Parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Non-trivial dispersion relations engineered in photonic waveguide for the precise control of atomic dynamics has recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we study a system in which atoms are coupled to one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguides with long-range hoppings. By carefully engineering the jth-order nearest neighbor (JNN) hoppings between resonators, we construct linear dispersion relations with the chiral characteristic. To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings. Our study thus provides a unified framework for simulating atom-environment couplings with arbitrary dispersion relations.</p>

            <p>Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</p>

            <p>Edge bit in an average symmetry protected topological (ASPT) mixed state is studied. The state is protected by one strong $Z_2$ and one weak (average) $Z_2$ symmetries. As analogous objects of pure symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, the ASPT possesses edge bits. In particular, the analogous operator response exists, that is, symmetry fractionalization. The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives.</p>

            <p>Optomechanical cooling of levitated nanoparticles has become an essential topic in modern quantum physics, providing a platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena and high-precision sensing. However, conventional cavity-assisted cooling is fundamentally constrained by cavity dissipation and environmental noise, limiting the attainable minimum temperature. In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme through nonreciprocal coupling between two levitated nanoparticles, where one particle is directly cooled by an optical cavity and the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling. This study demonstrates a new cooling mechanism driven by non-Hermitian interactions, offering theoretical guidance for realizing controllable energy flow and deep cooling in levitated optomechanical systems, and paving the way for future developments in quantum control and sensing technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantifiers of stationarity, classicality, purity and vorticity are derived from phase-space differential geometrical structures within the Weyl-Wigner framework, after which they are related to the hyperbolic stability of classical and quantum-modified Hamiltonian (non-linear) equations of motion. By examining the equilibrium regime produced by such an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, a correspondence between Wigner flow properties and hyperbolic stability boundaries in the phase-space is identified. Explicit analytical expressions for equilibrium-stability parameters are obtained for quantum Gaussian ensembles, wherein information quantifiers driven by Wigner currents are identified. Illustrated by an application to a Harper-like system, the results provide a self-contained analysis for identifying the influence of quantum fluctuations associated to the emergence of phase-space vorticity in order to quantify equilibrium and stability properties of Hamiltonian non-linear dynamics.</p>

Optimal sensitivity requires only moderate initial squeezing, and the non-Gaussian advantage remains robust against loss and detection noise. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that several experimentally relevant preparation schemes surpass Gaussian limits, in some cases reaching the sensitivity of cubic phase states. Our results establish cubic phase states as a promising resource for quantum-enhanced precision measurements beyond Gaussian limits.</p>

We present a quantum algorithm for the Largest Empty Square problem and the Largest Empty Rectangle of a fixed width $d$ for $n\times n$-rectangular map. Query complexity of the algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ for the square case, and $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d})$ for the rectangle with a fixed width $d$ case, respectively. At the same time, the lower bounds for the classical case are $\Omega(n^2)$, and $\Omega(nd)$, respectively. The Quantum algorithm for the one-dimensional version of the problem has $O(\sqrt{n}\log n\log\log n)$ query complexity. The quantum lower bound for the problem is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ which is almost equal to the upper bound up to a log factor. The classical lower bound is $\Omega(n)$.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Chen, Teng-Yang Ma, Meng-Han Dou, Chao-Fu Wang</p>
            <p>Conventional classical solvers are commonly used for solving matrix equation systems resulting from the discretization of SIEs in computational electromagnetics (CEM). However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural "parallelization" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems.</p>

            <p>Quantum high-harmonic generation (HHG) is a growing field of research with capabilities of providing high photon-number entangled states of light. However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) security fundamentally relies on the ability to distinguish genuine quantum correlations from classical eavesdropper simulations, yet existing certification methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios. We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness.</p>

Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.</p>

            <p>We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $\Delta(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.</p>

Recently it was shown that a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor $\pm J$ random coupling has a polynomial energy gap in the symmetric subspace of the parity operator [Nature 631, 749-754 (2024)], indicating the efficient preparation of its ground states by quantum annealing. However, it is not clear if this result can be generalized to other spin glass models with continuous or biased randomness. Here we prove that under general independent and identical distributions (i.i.d.) of the exchange energies, the energy gap of a one-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model follows a stretched exponential scaling even in the parity-restricted subspace. We discuss the implication of this result to quantum annealing problems.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in coherent conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttling are paving the way for large-scale quantum computing platforms with qubit connectivity achieved by spin qubit shuttles. We developed a simulation tool to investigate numerically the impact of device imperfections on the spin-coherence of conveyor-mode shuttling in Si/SiGe. We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane. We consider different locations of a single charge defect with respect to the center of the shuttle lane, multiple orbital states of the electron in the shuttle with $g$-factor differences between the orbital levels, and orbital relaxation induced by electron-phonon interaction. With this simulation framework, we identify the critical defect density of charged point defects in the heterostructure for conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttle devices and quantify the impact of a single defect on the coherence of a qubit.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold fermions in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan A. P. Reuter, Juhi Singh, Tommaso Calarco, Felix Motzoi, Robert Zeier</p>
            <p>Ultracold neutral atoms in optical lattices are a promising platform for simulating the behavior of complex materials and implementing quantum gates. We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant. We obtain high-fidelity gates based on a one-dimensional confinement simulation. Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately.</p>

            <h2>More is uncorrelated: Tuning the local correlations of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems via controlled symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Zavatti, Gabriele Bellomia, Samuele Giuli, Matteo Ferraretto, Massimo Capone</p>
            <p>Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachid El Aitouni, Miloud Mekkaoui, Pablo Díaz, David Laroze, Ahmed Jellal</p>
            <p>We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.</p>

In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.</p>

            <p>Amid the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology 2025 (IYQ 2025), a significant portion of global funding has been dedicated to various quantum initiatives, with over 30 countries announcing their respective quantum strategies. Within the Southeast Asia context, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines have launched their respective quantum strategies and roadmaps. Meanwhile, six out of eleven Southeast Asia countries have expressed interest in formulating a regional quantum ecosystem to pursue a set of common goals. Quantum technologies, though still in their infancy within the second quantum revolution, have advanced rapidly in recent years. Due to their dual-use nature, quantum technologies are considered emerging and disruptive, often raising concerns from the cybersecurity perspective. While several discussions regarding Malaysia's quantum initiative and strategy are ongoing, it is vital to broaden the conversation and position Malaysia within the regional ecosystem. This paper provides an overview of Malaysia's quantum landscape and a summary of the regional initiatives since the establishment of Southeast Asia Quantum Network. We then analyse Malaysia's strengths in quantum research and provide four recommendations to strengthen the regional ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Contrary Inferences for Classical Histories within the Consistent Histories Formulation of Quantum Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adamantia Zampeli, Georgios E. Pavlou, Petros Wallden</p>
            <p>In the histories formulation of quantum theory, sets of coarse-grained histories that are consistent obey the classical probability rules. It has been argued that these sets can describe the quasi-classical behaviour of closed quantum systems, e.g. Omnes (Rev. Mod. Phys. 64(2), 339, 1992) and Hartle (Les Houches1992). Most physical scenarios admit multiple different consistent sets and one can view each of these as a separate context. Using propositions from different consistent sets to make inferences leads to paradoxes such as contrary inferences, first noted by Kent (Phys. Rev. Lett. 78(15), 2874, 1997). In this contribution, we use the consistent histories to describe a quasi-classical and macroscopic system to show that paradoxes involving contextuality persist even in the quasi-classical limit. This is distinctively different from the contextuality of standard quantum theory, where the contextuality paradoxes do not persist in the quasi-classical limit. Specifically, we consider different consistent sets for the arrival time problem of a (quasi-classical) ball in an infinite square well. For this setting, we construct two different consistent sets. We find the probabilities that each consistent set assigns to the simple question of whether the ball ever crossed the middle of the interval. We show that one consistent set concludes with certainty that the ball crossed it while the other consistent set concludes with certainty that it did not. Our results point to the need for constraints on the histories sets, additional to the consistency condition, to recover the correct quasi-classical limit in this formalism and lead to the motto "all consistent sets are equal", but "some consistent sets are more equal than others".</p>

            <p>Evolutions under non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can be considered unitary under appropriate choices of inner products, facilitated by the so-called metric operator. While it is understood that the choice of the metric operator has no bearing on the description of the system, in this work, we show that this choice does dictate the entanglement structure of the system. We show that the partial trace of the Hermitized density matrix gives the correct representation of the reduced subsystem, and based on such operations, we elucidate the metric dependency of the reduced dynamics and consequently the observable dependence of the subsystem decomposition. We use a non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum walk as a toy model to study this metric dependency, where we use the internal (coin state) as the subsystem of interest and study the coin-position entanglement and non-Markovianity of the coin dynamics.</p>

            <h2>A refinement of the argument of local realism versus quantum mechanics by algorithmic randomness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohtaro Tadaki</p>
            <p>The notion of probability plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It appears in quantum mechanics as the Born rule. In modern mathematics which describes quantum mechanics, however, probability theory means nothing other than measure theory, and therefore any operational characterization of the notion of probability is still missing in quantum mechanics. In our former works [K. Tadaki, arXiv:1804.10174], based on the toolkit of algorithmic randomness, we presented a refinement of the Born rule, called the principle of typicality, for specifying the property of results of measurements in an operational way. In this paper, we make an application of our framework to the argument of local realism versus quantum mechanics for refining it, in order to demonstrate how properly our framework works in practical problems in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>We present a finite-size security proof of the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol against coherent attacks, using entropic uncertainty relations, for imperfect detectors. We apply this result to the case of detectors with imperfectly characterized basis-efficiency mismatch. Our proof works by obtaining a suitable bound on the phase error rate, without requiring any new modifications to the protocol steps or hardware. It is applicable to imperfectly characterized detectors, and only requires the maximum relative difference in detection efficiencies and dark count rates of the detectors to be characterized. Moreover, our proof allows Eve to choose detector efficiencies and dark count rates in their allowed ranges in each round, thereby addressing an important problem of detector side channels. We prove security in the variable-length framework, where users are allowed to adaptively determine the length of key to be produced, and number of bits to be used for error-correction, based on observations made during the protocol. We quantitatively demonstrate the effect of basis-efficiency mismatch by applying our results to the decoy-state BB84 protocol.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Liouvillian exceptional points from exact principles</h2>

            <p>Recent years have seen a surge of interest in exceptional points in open quantum systems. The natural approach in this area has been the use of Markovian master equations. While the resulting Liouvillian EPs have been seen in a variety of systems and have been associated to numerous exotic effects, it is an open question whether such degeneracies and their peculiarities can persist beyond the validity of master equations. In this work, taking the example of a dissipative double-quantum-dot system, we show that exact Heisenberg equations governing system and bath dynamics exhibit the same EPs as the corresponding master equations. To highlight the importance of this finding, we prove that the paradigmatic property associated to EPs - critical damping, persists well beyond the validity of master equations. Our results demonstrate that Liouvillian EPs can arise from underlying fundamental exact principles, rather than merely as a consequence of approximations involved in deriving master equations.</p>

            <p>While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</p>

            <h2>Oracle Separations for the Quantum-Classical Polynomial Hierarchy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avantika Agarwal, Shalev Ben-David</p>
            <p>We study the quantum-classical polynomial hierarchy, QCPH, which is the class of languages solvable by a constant number of alternating classical quantifiers followed by a quantum verifier. Our main result is that QCPH is infinite relative to a random oracle (previously, this was not even known relative to any oracle). We further prove that higher levels of PH are not contained in lower levels of QCPH relative to a random oracle; this is a strengthening of the somewhat recent result that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle (Rossman, Servedio, and Tan 2016). The oracle separation requires lower bounding a certain type of low-depth alternating circuit with some quantum gates. To establish this, we give a new switching lemma for quantum algorithms which may be of independent interest. Our lemma says that for any $d$, if we apply a random restriction to a function $f$ with quantum query complexity $\mathrm{Q}(f)\le n^{1/3}$, the restricted function becomes exponentially close (in terms of $d$) to a depth-$d$ decision tree. Our switching lemma works even in a "worst-case" sense, in that only the indices to be restricted are random; the values they are restricted to are chosen adversarially. Moreover, the switching lemma also works for polynomial degree in place of quantum query complexity.</p>

            <p>The comb-like spectrum added to laser light by an electro-optic modulator (EOM) finds use in a wide range of applications, including coherent optical communication, atomic spectroscopy, and laser frequency and phase stabilization. In some cases a sideband-free optical frequency shift is preferred, such as in laser offset locking using an optical cavity, single-photon frequency shifting, and laser range finding. Approaches to obtaining an optical frequency offset (OFO) involve trade-offs between shift range, conversion gain, and suppression of spurious sidebands. Here we demonstrate an OFO of continuous-wave 871 nm laser light by serrodyne modulation using a fiber EOM and radio-frequency (RF) tones from a commercial RF system on a chip (RFSoC) to achieve shifts of 40 to 800 MHz with > 15 dB suppression of spurious sidebands and < 1.5 dB conversion loss. We also observe a smoothly varying conversion gain. The utility of this tool is demonstrated by continuously shifting the offset of a cavity-locked laser from 50 to 1600 MHz, a capability useful in spectroscopy of unknown optical transitions.</p>

            <p>I investigate the problem of optimally discriminating between two open quantum dynamical processes in a single-shot scenario, with the goal of minimizing the error probability of identification. This task involves optimising both the input state -- potentially entangled with an ancillary system that remains isolated from the dynamics -- and the time at which the resulting time-dependent quantum channels, induced by the two distinct dynamical maps, becomes most distinguishable. To illustrate the complexity and richness of this problem, I focus on Pauli dynamical maps and their associated families of time-dependent Pauli channels. I identify a regime in which separable strategies require waiting indefinitely for the dynamics to reach the stationary state, whereas entangled input states enable optimal discrimination at a finite time, with a strict reduction in error probability. These results highlight the crucial interplay between entanglement and timing in enhancing the distinguishability of quantum dynamical processes.</p>

            <p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling probability distributions, commonly applied to the Boltzmann distribution in physical and chemical models such as protein folding and the Ising model.

In this context, quantum computing, with its potential to accelerate classical methods, emerges as a promising solution to the sampling problem. In this work, we present the design of a new circuit based on the Discrete Quantum Walk (DQW) algorithm to perform MCMC sampling over a desired distributions. Simulation results show convergence behavior in the superposition of the quantum register that encodes the target distribution. This design is further refined to increase convergence speed and, consequently, the scalability of the algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline E. P. Robin</p>
            <p>We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin models are ubiquitous in solid-state physics, but classical simulation of them remains extremely challenging. Experimental testbed systems with a variety of spin-spin interactions and measurement channels are therefore needed. One promising potential route to such testbeds is provided by microwave-photon-mediated interactions between superconducting qubits, where native strong light-matter coupling enables significant interactions even for virtual-photon-mediated processes. In this approach, the spin-model connectivity is set by the photonic mode structure, rather than the spatial structure of the qubit. Lattices of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonators have been demonstrated to allow extremely flexible connectivities and can therefore host a huge variety of photon-mediated spin models. However, large-scale CPW lattices with non-trivial band structures have never before been successfully combined with superconducting qubits. Here we present the first such device featuring a quasi-1D CPW lattice with multiple transmon qubits. We demonstrate that superconducting-qubit readout and diagnostic techniques can be generalized to this highly multimode environment and observe the effective qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the bands of the resonator lattice. This device completes the toolkit needed to realize CPW lattices with qubits in one or two Euclidean dimensions, or negatively-curved hyperbolic space, and paves the way to driven-dissipative spin models with a large variety of connectivities.</p>

Within an operational framework, we systematically compare the statistical correlations that can be generated in such tasks using classical particles, quantum particles in spatial superposition, and more general "second-order interference" resources. We bound classical strategies via convex polytopes and present a study of their symmetry, demonstrating that the vertices are inherently connected to K-juntas as defined in the classical theory of Boolean functions, while their facet inequalities are in one-to-one correspondence with oracle games. We then analyze the violation of the "fingerprinting inequality" achievable by the use of one quantum particle, and we study the dependence of this violation on the dimension d of the particle's internal degree of freedom. In particular, we show that the case of d = 2 can achieve a higher violation of the inequality than the previously investigated case of d = 1. We also provide analytic and numerical evidence that this violation cannot be further increased for larger d > 2. Finally, we find that both quantum and any other (generalized) second-order interference models exhibit the same asymptotic scaling in violating the fingerprinting inequality. Our results thereby further articulate quantum interference and spatial superposition as a resource for information processing.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <p>Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER) was recently proposed as a fast and robust single-qubit gate mechanism in $^{87}$Sr. Here, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that ONER can be extended to single-qudit control, addressing multiple one-level hyperfine transitions within the ten-dimensional nuclear-spin manifold. We identify suitable operating regimes and show that ONER enables high-fidelity spin manipulations, with simulated $\pi$-gate fidelities exceeding 99.9\%, while maintaining coherence under realistic parameter fluctuations. These results establish a proof-of-principle for optical qudit control in $^{87}$Sr and delineate practical parameter ranges for future experiments, highlighting ONER as a promising pathway toward high-dimensional quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Monika Rani, Supriyo Dutta, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>In quantum communication, quantum state transfer from one location to another in a quantum network plays a prominent role, where the impact of noise could be crucial. The idea of state transfer can be fruitfully associated with quantum walk on graphs. We investigate the consequences of non-Markovian quantum noises on periodicity and state transfer induced by a discrete-time quantum walk on graphs, governed by the Grover coin operator. Different bipartite graphs, such as the path graph, cycle graph, star graph, and complete bipartite graph, present periodicity and state transfer in a discrete-time quantum walk depending on the topology of the graph. We investigate the effect of quantum non-Markovian dephasing noises, particularly quantum non-Markovian Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and modified non-Markovian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN) on state transfer and periodicity. We demonstrate how the RTN and OUN noises allow state transfer and periodicity for a finite number of steps in a quantum walk. Our investigation brings out the feasibility of state transfer in a noisy environment.</p>

            <h2>What's my phase again? Computing the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of quadratic bosonic evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolás Quesada</p>
            <p>Quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians and their associated unitary transformations form a fundamental class of operations in quantum optics, modelling key processes such as squeezing, displacement, and beam-splitting. Their Heisenberg-picture dynamics simplifies to linear (or possibly affine) transformations on quadrature operators, enabling efficient analysis and decomposition into optical gate sets using matrix operations. However, this formalism discards a phase, which, while often neglected, is essential for a complete unitary characterization. We present efficient methods to recover this phase directly from the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of the unitary, using calculations that scale polynomially with the number of modes and avoid Fock space manipulations. We reduce the general problem for time-dependent Hamiltonians to integration, and provide analytical results for key cases including time-independent Hamiltonians which are positive definite, passive, active, or single-mode. Finally, we show that our results can be easily used to obtain the phase associated with any Gaussian state, be it mixed or pure.</p>

            <h2>A dynamic circuit for the honeycomb Floquet code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jahan Claes</p>
            <p>In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.</p>

            <p>We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</p>

            <h2>Barnett Effect-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power in Magnomechanics with Optical Parametric Amplifier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noura Chabar, M. Amghar, Shakir Ullah, Mohamed Amazioug</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power (GIP) via the Barnett effect. The YIG is coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. By fine-tuning the cavity detuning, the GIP can exhibits nonreciprocal behavior. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Salmanogli, Hesam Zandi</p>
            <p>This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunyan Lee, Ian R. Petersen, Daoyi Dong</p>
            <p>Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. In this work, we propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers: Resonator Design and Role in Qubit Readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Mohammadian</p>
            <p>Superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) are critical components for ultralow-noise qubit readout in quantum computing, addressing the critical challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals without introducing noise that degrades coherence and computational fidelity. Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination.</p>

            <h2>Foundations of Quantum Granular Computing with Effect-Based Granules, Algebraic Properties and Reference Architectures</h2>

            <p>This paper develops the foundations of Quantum Granular Computing (QGC), extending classical granular computing including fuzzy, rough, and shadowed granules to the quantum regime. Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.</p>

            <p>Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement encoded in two or more independent degrees of freedom (DOFs), is a valuable resource for the future high-capacity quantum network. Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</p>

            <p>We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</p>

Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior.

            <p>Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in \textit{Phys.\ Rev.\ D 100, 045024 (2019)}, we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In our approach, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Moreover, we find that the ratio between emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a detailed study of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. For completeness, we also apply the method to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.</p>

The construction can be seen as providing a natural way to isometrically embed any given finite metric space into the space of pure quantum states 'spanned' upon it. In order to show that the maps $d_p$ are indeed distance functions -- in particular, that they satisfy the triangle inequality -- we employ methods of analysis, multilinear algebra and convex geometry, obtaining a nontrivial auxiliary convexity result in the process.

            <p>Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Flynn, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity kinematics.</p>

            <p>We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution.

            <h2>Dispersion Outperforms Absorption: EIT-Enhanced Atomic Localization and Gradient Sensing with Super-Gaussian Beams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahboob Ul Haq</p>
            <p>This work presents a comprehensive theoretical comparison between absorption-based and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based atomic gradient sensing in a four-level tripod system. Both methods were evaluated under identical and optimized physical conditions to ensure a fair and unbiased comparison. The analysis demonstrates that EIT, driven by its steep dispersion response, consistently outperforms conventional absorption detection across a wide range of super-Gaussian beam profiles. Under optimal detuning, EIT achieved up to an order-of-magnitude enhancement in gradient sensitivity and maintained a twofold advantage even under identical detuning. Both approaches reached sub-diffraction spatial resolution in the range of 0.29lambda-0.40lambda, with EIT exhibiting sharper edge contrast and higher localization accuracy. These results confirm EIT as a fundamentally superior approach for precision atomic gradient sensing and sub-wavelength localization, offering clear guidance for the design of next-generation optical and quantum metrology systems.</p>

            <p>The Kibble-Zurek mechanism quantifies defect formation during adiabatic passage across a continuous phase transition, providing key insights into universality in quantum many-body systems. We explore counting statistics of defects in adiabatic passage experiments on long 1D Rydberg atom chains. The experiments reveal an anomaly in the defect number distribution at long ramp times, challenging the hypothesis of defect formation through independent domain mergers. Numerical simulations confirm the anomaly and suggest its link to non-critical coarsening dynamics, which we suppress in prepare-and-hold experiments. Our results highlight the ability of quantum simulators to uncover unexpected correlated quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Progress in quantum metrology and applications for optical atomic clocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Kaubruegger, Adam M. Kaufman</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement offers powerful opportunities for enhancing measurement sensitivity beyond classical limits, with optical atomic clocks serving as a leading platform for such advances. This chapter introduces the principles of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology and explores their applications to timekeeping. We review the theoretical framework of quantum phase estimation, comparing frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and discuss paradigmatic entangled states such as spin-squeezed and GHZ states. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges posed by decoherence, which constrain the practical advantages that can be realized in large-scale devices. The discussion then turns to frequency estimation in atomic clocks, highlighting how experimental constraints shape the translation of abstract quantum limits into real performance gains. Finally, we outline emerging directions of contemporary quantum metrology. Together, these developments underscore the increasingly close interplay between quantum information processing and precision metrology.</p>

            <h2>Microwave Circulation in an Extended Josephson Junction Ring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dat Thanh Le, Arkady Fedorov, Thomas M. Stace</p>
            <p>Circulators are nonreciprocal devices that enable directional signal routing. Nonreciprocity, which requires time-reversal symmetry breaking, can be produced in waveguides in which the propagation medium moves relative to the waveguide at a moderate fraction of the wave speed. Motivated by this effect, here we propose a design for nonreciprocal microwave transmission based on an extended, annular Josephson junction, in which the propagation medium consists of a train of moving fluxons. We show how to harness this to build a high-quality resonant microwave circulator, and we theoretically evaluate the anticipated performance of such a device.</p>

            <h2>Detection of photon-level signals embedded in sunlight with an atomic photodetector</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Zarraoa, Romain Veyron, Tomas Lamich, Sondos Elsehimy, Morgan W. Mitchell</p>
            <p>The detection of few-photon signals in a broadband background is an extreme challenge for photon counting, requiring filtering that accepts a narrow range of optical frequencies while strongly rejecting all others. Recent work [Zarraoa et. al, Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033338 (2024)] demonstrated that trapped single atoms can act as low dark-count narrow-band photodetectors. Here we show that this ``quantum jump photodetector'' (QJPD) approach can also detect photon-level signals embedded in strong sunlight. Using a single rubidium atom as a QJPD, we count arrivals of individual narrow-band laser photons embedded in sunlight powers of order $10^{10}$ photons/s. We derive a rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics in sunlight, and find quantitative agreement with experiment. Using this model, we calculate the channel capacity over a noisy communication channel when sending weak coherent states and detecting them in the presence of sunlight, achieving a representative rate of 0.5 bits per symbol when sending 150 probe photons per 10 ms time-bin, embedded in 1 nW of sunlight (of order $10^{10}$ photons/s in the visible and near-infrared bands). The demonstration may benefit background-limited applications such as daytime light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote magnetometry, and free-space classical and quantum optical communications.</p>

            <h2>A unified optical platform for non-Gaussian and fault-tolerant Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states</h2>

            <p>Quantum technologies, encompassing communication, computation, and metrology, rely on the generation and control of non-Gaussian states of light. These states enable secure quantum communication, fault-tolerant quantum computation, and precision sensing beyond classical limits, yet their practical realisation remains a major challenge due to reliance on high-photon-number Fock states or strong non-linearities. Here we introduce a unified optical framework that removes this constraint, using only Gaussian inputs, optical parametric amplification, and heralded photon detection. Within a single architecture, we demonstrate the generation of photon-added squeezed states with near unit fidelity, cubic-phase-like states with strong non-linearities and fidelities above 98.5%, and squeezed-cat states exceeding 99% fidelity that can be iteratively bred into GKP grid states surpassing the 9.75 dB fault-tolerance threshold. Operating entirely below 3 dB of input squeezing, the approach provides a scalable, experimentally accessible platform that unites the state resources required for quantum communication, metrology, and computation within one coherent optical framework.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics with parity-time (PT) symmetry offers a powerful framework for exploring the complex interplay of dissipation and coherent interactions in open quantum systems. While PT-symmetry breaking has been studied in various physical systems, its observation on a quantum many-body level remains elusive. Here, we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian XY model in a strongly-interacting Rydberg-atom array. By measuring the Loschmidt Echo of a fully polarized state, we observe distinct dynamical signatures of a PT-symmetry-breaking phase transition. Dipole interactions are found to play a crucial role, not only determining the transition point but also triggering a non-Hermitian many-body blockade effect that protects the Loschmidt Echo from decay with a non-monotonic dependence on the system size. Our results reveal intricate interaction-induced effects on PT-symmetry breaking and open the door for exploring non-Hermitian many-body dynamics beyond single-particle and mean-field paradigms.</p>

            <h2>Fault-tolerant quantum computation with constant overhead for general noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Christandl, Omar Fawzi, Ashutosh Goswami</p>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computation traditionally incurs substantial resource overhead, with both qubit and time overheads scaling polylogarithmically with the size of the computation. While prior work by Gottesman showed that constant qubit overhead is achievable under stochastic noise using quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, it has remained an open question whether similar guarantees hold under more general, non-stochastic noise models. In this work, we address this question by considering a general circuit-level noise model defined via the diamond norm, which captures both stochastic and non-stochastic noise, including coherent and amplitude damping noise. We prove that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable in this general setting, using QLDPC codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. To establish our result, we develop a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise. These results extend the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and offer new directions for fault-tolerant architectures under realistic noise models.</p>

            <p>Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Creffield, Fernando Sols, Marco Schirò, Nathan Goldman</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel abstraction for programming quantum operations, specifically projective Cliffords, as functions over the qudit Pauli group. Generalizing the idea behind Pauli tableaux, we introduce a type system and lambda calculus for projective Cliffords called LambdaPC, which captures well-formed Clifford operations via a Curry-Howard correspondence with a particular encoding of the Clifford and Pauli groups. Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous emission in Casimir-Rabi oscillations through a weak optomechanical coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke-Xiong Yan, Yuan Qiu, Yang Xiao, Jie Song, Ye-Hong Chen, Yan Xia</p>
            <p>The dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) describes the energy conversion from a mechanical motion to the electromagnetic fields. When the mechanical oscillator is in a mechanically excited state, the free evolution due to the DCE produces radiation in the vacuum, in analogy with the spontaneous emission from an excited atom. In this manuscript, we investigate such a spontaneous radiation process by employing the quantum trajectory approach. When the dissipation rate of the system is very low, there can be a reversible energy exchange between the mirror in the excited state and the vacuum field, and this reversible exchange is called vacuum Casimir-Rabi oscillations. Multiple quantum trajectory simulations of this process show that the number of trajectories responsible for the generation of radiation can reach a significant value when the mechanical dissipation rate is less than the photon dissipation rate. We also find that two-photon (two/three-phonon) bundle emission occurs in photon (phonon) emission. In comparison to pure two-photon and three-phonon free dissipation, the probability of two-photon bundle emission and two-phonon bundle emission are observed to be marginally elevated as a consequence of the presence of the DCE. This pattern may assist in developing a deeper comprehension of the physical characteristics of photon and phonon emission in the DCE.</p>

            <h2>Error-mitigated quantum metrology via enhanced virtual purification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodie Lin, Haidong Yuan</p>
            <p>Quantum metrology stands as a leading application of quantum science and technology, yet noise often constrains its precision and sensitivity. In near-term quantum metrology, existing protocols largely depend on virtual state purification, but significant noise accumulation and additional noise from the implementations of these protocols can impede their effectiveness. We propose enhanced virtual channel purification to address these problems, yielding enhanced virtual state purification as a by-product. Within sequential quantum metrology schemes, our error analysis reveals substantial bias reduction and quantum advantages in sampling cost when the number of encoding channels is ${\mathcal{O}}(p^{-1})$, where $p$ represents the error rate of encoding channels. In this range, our methods demonstrate significant improvements in parameter estimation precision and robustness against practical noise, as evidenced by numerical simulations for both single- and multi-parameter tasks. Particularly, these methods can naturally extend beyond quantum metrology, indicating their broad applicability in quantum information and quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenan Wei, Liu Yang, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Bell nonlocality provides a robust scalable route to the efficient certification of quantum states. Here, we introduce a general framework for constructing Bell inequalities tailored to the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code for odd prime local dimensions. Selecting a suitable subset of stabilizer operators and mapping them to generalized measurement observables, we compute multipartite Bell expressions whose quantum maxima admit a sum-of-squares decomposition. We show that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state manifold of the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$ and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections. Our results establish a pathway toward device-independent certification of highly entangled topological quantum matter and provide new tools for validating qudit states in error-correcting codes and quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution through terrestrial and free space channels; however, the exponential loss in these channels necessitates quantum repeaters with efficient, long lived quantum memories (QMs). Space based architectures, particularly satellite assisted links, offer a path to truly global connectivity, yet they demand QMs that are compatible with orbital factors such as infrared radiation and the unique challenges of operating aboard a satellite. In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling the storage of 100 modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light limited round trip times. Representative link budgets at $h = 500$ km with realistic apertures, $\eta_{\text{mem}}\gtrsim 70%$, and $t_{\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to a memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are (i) a non cryogenic, space ready multimode memory, (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate, and (iii) a near term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near term technology and provide a practical path toward a high rate, space enabled quantum internet.</p>

            <p>We theoretically present new unit circuits of Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with four-body interactions, which enable the scalable embedding of all-to-all connected logical Ising spins using the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. These unit circuits enable four-body interactions using linear couplers, making the circuit fabrication and characterization much simpler than those of conventional unit circuits with nonlinear couplers. Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitudes of the coupling constants can be comparable to those in conventional circuits. On the basis of this theory, we designed a four-KPO circuit and experimentally confirmed the four-body correlation by measuring the pump-phase dependence of the parity of the four-KPO states. We show that the choice of the pump frequencies are important not only to enable the four-body interaction, but to cancel the effects of other unwanted interactions. Using the circuit, we demonstrated the quantum annealing based on the LHZ scheme, where the strength of the interaction between the logical Ising spins is mapped to the local field and controlled by a coherent drive applied to each KPO.</p>

In this architecture, input and ancillary non-Gaussian quantum states necessary for fault-tolerance and universality of quantum computing are generated with pulsed light, whereas quantum processors including continuous-variable cluster states and homodyne measurement systems are operated with CW light. This architecture is expected to enable both generation of quantum states with shorter optical wavepackets and low-loss manipulation and measurement of these states, thus is compatible with ultrafast and low-loss quantum information processing. In this study, as a proof-of-principle, an ultrafast homodyne measurement using CW local oscillator was performed on single-photon states generated with pulsed light. The measured single-photon state's temporal width was around 70 ps and the value of the Wigner function at the origin was W(0,0) = -0.153 +/- 0.003, which is highly non-classical.

            <h2>Optimized Many-Hypercube Codes toward Lower Logical Error Rates and Earlier Realization</h2>

            <p>Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</p>

            <p>Multiqubit gates that involve three or more qubits are usually thought to be of little significance for fault-tolerant quantum error correction because single gate faults can lead to high-weight correlated errors. However, recent works have shown that multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and for fault-tolerant stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations. Simulations with realistic circuit-level noise indicate that applying three-qubit gates for stabilizer measurements in Floquet codes can yield competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes.</p>

These vibrations define the linewidths of the absorption and emission spectral peaks, as well as the Stokes shift. In cavities that use a molecular film as an active medium, low-frequency molecular vibrations facilitate the thermalization of light, enabling the formation of Bose-Einstein condensation. In this work, I employ perturbation theory for Lindblad superoperators and derive the contribution of the low-frequency molecular vibrations to the thermalization rate of light in a weak coupling regime between light and matter. The derived thermalization rate applies for any cavity design but depends on the local microscopic properties of low-frequency molecular vibrations. I provide an estimation for the thermalization rate, which requires only knowledge of the macroscopic parameters of the system: light-matter interaction strength, resonant frequencies of the cavity and excitons, number of molecules in the illuminated area, and the linewidth temperature dependence of the 0-0 peak in the emission spectra of standalone molecular film.</p>

            <p>The projected rapid growth of battery cell production over the next decade demands advanced diagnostic tools for quality control, ageing prediction, and recycling. Most existing techniques lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to capture internal electrochemical processes non-invasively. Here, we present magnetic imaging of current densities in battery cells, a sensitive quantum-magnetometry method that uses optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to perform real-time imaging of internal dynamics in open-circuit configuration. We demonstrate this approach for monitoring relaxation processes in 6000 mA h lithium-ion cells following pulsed discharges across a range of pulse durations and currents as well as states of charge. The measurement results are benchmarked against superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometry and validated with three-dimensional finite element simulations. Equivalent circuit models are employed to interpret the relaxation profiles, revealing spatially resolved features and transient magnetic-field signatures that are inaccessible with complementary non-invasive techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This work establishes OPM-based magnetic imaging of battery current density as a powerful diagnostic tool with potential impact on cell development, manufacturing quality assurance, and second-life assessment.</p>

            <h2>Passive Polarization Stabilization for Practical and Robust Entanglement Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Woo Kim, Minchul Kim, Jiho Park, Chunju Youn</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science, playing an essential role in quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum networks, and distributed quantum computing. However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geng Zhao, Yun Chen, Jiayuang Zhang, Jing Tang, Yuangang Deng</p>
            <p>We propose an experimentally accessible scheme for realizing tunable nonclassical light in cavity-coupled reconfigurable atomic arrays. By coherently controlling the collective interference phase, the system switches from single-photon blockade to high-purity multiphoton bundle emission, unveiling a hierarchical structure of photon correlations dictated by atom-number parity and cavity detuning. The scaling of photon population identifies the transition between superradiant and subradiant regimes, while parity- and phase-dependent spin correlations elucidate the microscopic interference processes enabling coherent multiphoton generation. This work establishes a unified framework connecting cooperative atomic interactions to controllable nonclassical photon statistics and introduces a distinct interference-enabled mechanism that provides a practical route toward high-fidelity multiphoton sources in scalable cavity QEDs.</p>

            <p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted intense interest, yet their many-particle counterparts remain largely unexplored in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. We identify and characterize a bound state embedded in the doublon continuum (BIDC) that emerges when four atoms couple to a coupled-resonator waveguide with strong on-site interaction. Exploiting this interaction-enabled BIDC, we show that (i) a distant, four-atom entangled state can be prepared with high fidelity, and (ii) quantum entangled states can be coherently transferred between spatially separated nodes. Our results establish a scalable mechanism for multi-particle state generation and routing in waveguide platforms, opening a route to interaction-protected quantum communication with many-particle BICs.</p>

            <p>The Wigner function is a well-known phase space distribution function with many applications in quantum mechanics. In this article, we consider an open quantum system consisting of a non-relativistic single particle interacting with a general, possibly relativistic environment. For this system, we derive an expression for directly computing the time-dependent Wigner function from its initial values. This result renders time-dependent Wigner functions more applicable without having to make additional approximations that would otherwise be required in order to solve the corresponding equation of motion. As an illustration of our findings, we discuss the example of a non-relativistic single scalar particle interacting via a Yukawa interaction with an environment comprising another type of scalar field that is treated relativistically.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eyal Buks</p>
            <p>The response of a ferrimagnetic sphere resonator to an externally applied parametric excitation is experimentally studied. Measurement results are compared with predictions derived from a theoretical model, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a modified master equation having an added nonlinear term that deterministically generates disentanglement. It is found that the disentanglement--based model is compatible with the experimental results. In particular, the model can qualitatively account for an experimentally observed instability in the system under study, which cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a linear master equation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Borsoni</p>
            <p>We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole set, broadening the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case where the convex is a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovitch cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-França [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost.</p>

            <p>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has emerged as a promising approach for secure quantum communication, offering advantages such as high key generation rates, compatibility with standard telecommunication infrastructure, and potential for integration on photonic chips. This review provides an accessible introduction to the theory of CV-QKD, aimed at researchers entering this rapidly developing field. We focus on fundamental concepts, key protocols, and security analysis essential for understanding CV-QKD systems, with a special emphasis on prepare-and-measure protocols using coherent states under asymptotic security conditions. We explain their equivalence to entanglement-based protocols and detail the security proof framework against collective attacks, encompassing both Gaussian and discrete modulation schemes. We also briefly address more advanced topics, including measurement-device-independent CV-QKD and finite-size security analysis. This work is motivated by Brazil's growing investment in quantum communication technologies. By presenting a clear learning path from basic concepts to advanced topics, this work aims to equip newcomers with the essential tools to engage with current research in CV-QKD, thereby supporting the training of a new generation of researchers in this strategic field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emad Rezaei Fard Boosari, Maryam Afsary</p>
            <p>Quantum state preparation (QSP) for a general $n$-qubit state requires $O(2^n)$ CNOT gates and circuit depth, making exact amplitude encoding (EAE) impractical for near-term quantum hardware. We introduce an ancilla-free hybrid classical-quantum strategy that reduces this cost to $O(poly(n))$ for a broad class of compressible data. The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL). The quantum simulation results show that combining classical data compression with quantum decompression provides a scalable framework for efficient QSP, reducing quantum overhead without requiring variational training or ancillary registers.</p>

            <p>Scalable quantum computing requires architectural solutions beyond monolithic processors. Distributed quantum computing (DQC) addresses this challenge by interconnecting smaller quantum nodes through quantum communication protocols, enabling collaborative computation. While several experimental and theoretical proposals for DQC exist, emulator platforms are essential tools for exploring their feasibility under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\mathrm{QFT}^{\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline. As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols. This framework can be extended to support additional algorithms and emulators.</p>

            <p>The quantum and reversible paradigm merges the principles of quantum mechanics and reversible computation to enable information-preserving processing. It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations.</p>

            <h2>Automated Compilation Including Dropouts: Tolerating Defective Components in Stabiliser Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stasiu Wolanski</p>
            <p>Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.</p>

Although embedding nonlinear materials within resonant structures allows for the enhancement and tailoring of photon properties, accurately modeling these quantum interactions remains a challenge. In this work, we apply the asymptotic-fields formalism, an approach based on scattering theory, to describe nonlinear optical processes within a Fabry-Pérot cavity. Unlike previous applications of this formalism, we explicitly account for reflections in the system. We derive the interaction Hamiltonian and calculate photon-pair generation rates using perturbation theory. The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors.</p>

            <p>Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony O. Lara, Justin J. Talbot, Zhe Wang, Martin Head-Gordon</p>
            <p>Large atomic-orbital (AO) basis sets of at least triple and preferably quadruple-zeta (QZ) size are required to adequately converge Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations towards the complete basis set limit. However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5.</p>

            <p>Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schrödinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.</p>

            <p>We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding. This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology. We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade. These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.</p>

            <p>Confinement is one of the hallmarks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit. Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Searching for Ultralight Dark Matter with MOLeQuTE: a Massive Optically Levitated Quantum Tabletop Experiment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Hamaide, Hannah Banks, Peter Barker, Andrew A. Geraci</p>
            <p>Many well theoretically motivated models of ultralight dark matter are expected to give rise to feeble oscillatory forces on macroscopic objects. Optically trapped sensors have high force sensitivities but have remained relatively unexplored in this context. In this work we propose a new, tunable, optically trapped sensor specifically designed to detect such forces. Our design features a high-mass (mg) plate whose weight is supported by a vertical beam. We present the first systematic analysis and optimisation of quantum noises in optically trapped systems and show that our setup has the potential to operate at the standard quantum limit with current off-the-shelf technologies. We demonstrate that our sensor could offer unique access to large regions of uncharted parameter space of vector B-L dark matter, with projected sensitivities that could advance existing limits by several orders of magnitude over a broad range of frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Band inversion transition in HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] direction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Li</p>
            <p>The low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] crystallographic direction is constructed by using the perturbation theory. Both the anisotropic term and the bulk inversion asymmetry term of the Kane model are taken into account. Although the anisotropic term has converted the crossing between the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands into an anticrossing at $k_{z}R\!=\!0$, the gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure can still occur at the wave vectors $k_{z}R\!\approx\!\pm0.24$ for critical nanowire radius $R\!\approx\!3.45$ nm. The bulk inversion asymmetry does not contribute to the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, i.e., there is no spin splitting in the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands for a [001] oriented cylindrical nanowire.</p>

            <h2>Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Lee-Yeung Ngai, Justin Tim-Lok Chau, Junchen Rong, Yuan Da Liao, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its critical role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</p>

            <h2>Resonant states and nuclear dynamics in solid-state systems: the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Woncheol Lee, Mark E. Turiansky, Dominic Waldhör, Byounghak Lee, Tibor Grasser, Chris G. Van de Walle</p>
            <p>Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the detection and control of individual Abrikosov vortices in superconducting microwave resonators. $\lambda/4$ resonators with a narrowed region near the grounded end acting as a vortex trap were fabricated and studied using microwave transmission spectroscopy at millikelvin temperatures. Sharp stepwise drops in resonance frequency are detected as a function of increasing external magnetic field, attributed to the entry of individual Abrikosov vortices in the narrow region. This interpretation is confirmed by NV center magnetometry revealing discrete vortex entry events on increasing field. Our results establish a method to investigate and manipulate the states of Abrikosov vortices with microwaves.</p>

            <h2>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanna Kuznetsova, Francesco Toppan</p>
            <p>We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</p>
