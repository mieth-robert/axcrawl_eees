            <h2>Neutrino thermalization via randomization on a quantum processor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oriel Kiss, Ivano Tavernelli, Francesco Tacchino, Denis Lacroix, Alessandro Roggero</p>
            <p>The dynamical evolution of neutrino flavor in supernovae can be modeled by an all-to-all spin Hamiltonian with random couplings. Simulating such two-local Hamiltonian dynamics remains a major challenge, as methods with controllable accuracy require circuit depths that increase at least linearly with system size, exceeding the capabilities of current quantum devices. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis predicts that these systems should thermalize, a behavior confirmed in small-scale classical simulations. In this work, we investigate flavor thermalization in much larger systems using random quantum circuits as an empirical tool to emulate the non-local dynamics, and demonstrate that the thermal behavior can be reproduced using a depth independent of the system size. By simulating dynamics of over one hundred qubits, we find that the thermalization time grows approximately as the square root of the system size, consistent with predictions from semi-classical methods. Beyond this specific result, our study illustrates that near-term quantum devices are useful tools to test and validate empirical classical methods. It also highlights a new application of random circuits in physics, providing insight into complex many-body dynamics that are classically intractable.</p>

            <h2>Classically Prepared, Quantumly Evolved: Hybrid Algorithm for Molecular Spectra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Santini, Stefano Barison, Filippo Vicentini</p>
            <p>We introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to compute dynamical correlation functions and excitation spectra in many-body quantum systems, with a focus on molecular systems. The method combines classical preparation of a perturbed ground state with short-time quantum evolution of product states sampled from it. The resulting quantum samples define an effective subspace of the Hilbert space, onto which the Hamiltonian is projected to enable efficient classical simulation of long-time dynamics. This subspace-based approach achieves high-resolution spectral reconstruction using shallow circuits and few samples. Benchmarks on molecular systems show excellent agreement with exact diagonalization and demonstrate access to dynamical timescales beyond the reach of purely classical methods, highlighting its suitability for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Engineering chlorine-based emitters in silicon carbide for telecom-band quantum technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. N. Anisimov, A. V. Mathews, K. Mavridou, U. Kentsch, M. Helm, G. V. Astakhov</p>
            <p>We report the experimental realization and optical characterization of chlorine-vacancy (ClV) color centers in 4H-SiC emitting in the fiber-optic telecom bands. These defects are created via chlorine ion implantation followed by high-temperature annealing. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals four distinct ClV configurations with zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) located in the O-band (1260 - 1360 nm), S-band (1460 - 1530 nm) and C-band (1530 - 1565 nm). Controlled implantation and annealing experiments confirm that the ClV centers originate specifically from chlorine incorporation into SiC and are not intrinsic to this material. We optimize the creation conditions for ClV ensembles and demonstrate negligible reduction of the ZPL intensity up to a temperature of 30 K. These results establish ClV defects as a new class of telecom-band color centers in a CMOS-compatible platform, offering strong potential for scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>The Phase-Coupled Caldeira-Leggett Model: Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics beyond Linear Dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ao-Xiang Chang, Yu Su, Zi-Fan Zhu, Yao Wang, Rui-Xue Xu, YiJing Yan</p>
            <p>We introduce the \textit{Phase-Coupled Caldeira-Leggett} (PCL) model of quantum dissipation and develop an exact framework for its dynamics. Unlike the conventional Caldeira-Leggett model with linear system-bath coupling $H_{\mathrm{SB}}\propto\hat F$, the PCL model features an exponential interaction $H_{\mathrm{SB}}\propto e^{i\lambda \hat F}$, where $\hat F$ denotes the collective bath coordinate. This model unifies concepts from quantum Brownian motion and polaron physics, providing a general platform to study phase-mediated dissipation and decoherence beyond the linear-response regime. Despite its nonlinear system-bath coupling, the Gaussian nature of the environment allows a nonperturbative and non-Markovian treatment of PCL model within the algebra of dissipative quasiparticles. We obtain an exact closed-form equation of motion for the reduced density operator, and numerical simulations reveal distinctive dynamical behaviors that deviate markedly from those predicted by the conventional Caldeira-Leggett model.</p>

            <h2>Design and Fabrication of Metal-Shielded Fiber-Cavity Mirrors for Ion-Trap Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Bin Chen, Ding Fang, Cheng-Hao Zhang, Jin-Ming Cui, Yun-Feng Huang, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>Trapped ions in micro-cavities constitute a key platform for advancing quantum information processing and quantum networking. By providing an efficient light-matter interface within a compact architecture, they serve as highly efficient quantum nodes with strong potential for scalable quantum network. However, in such systems, ion trapping stability is often compromised by surface charging effects, and nearby dielectric materials are known to cause a dramatic increase in the ion heating rate by several orders of magnitude. These challenges significantly hinder the practical implementation of ion trap systems integrated with micro-cavities. To overcome these limitations, we present the design and fabrication of metal-shielded micro-cavity mirrors, enabling the stable realization of ion trap systems integrated with micro cavities. Using this method, we constructed a needle ion trap integrated with fiber Fabry-Perot cavity and successfully achieved stable trapping of a single ion within the cavity. The measured ion heating rate was reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with unshielded configurations. This work establishes a key technique toward fully integrated ion-photon interfaces for scalable quantum network.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-correlated photons from spectrally-separated modes of a cavity coupled to a strongly-driven two-level atom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Elliott, Jacob Ngaha, Scott Parkins, Takao Aoki</p>
            <p>Photon counting statistics are explored, theoretically, from a pair of cavity modes coupled to the fluorescent transitions in a strongly-driven two-level atom. We show that the cavity modes acquire nonclassical photon statistics that are representative of dressed-state picture atomic transitions. In particular, the modes are shown to be antibunched, while simultaneously having a cross-correlation value greater than unity. Furthermore, we propose an implementation of the system with a nanofiber cavity QED system, based on a strongly-driven cesium atom.</p>

            <h2>Engineering Atom-Photon Hybridization with Density-Modulated Atomic Ensembles in Coupled Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos E. MÃ¡ximo, Romain Bachelard, Tobias Donner</p>
            <p>Radiation-matter hybridization allows atoms to serve as mediators of effective interactions between light modes and, conversely, to interact among themselves via light. Here we exploit the spatial structure of atomic ensembles to control the coupling between modes of distinct cavities, thereby reshaping the resulting atom-photon spectra. We show that extended homogeneous clouds suppress mode-mode couplings through destructive interference, whereas grated clouds can preserve them under specific Bragg conditions. This leads to mode-mode spectral subsplittings, where collectivity arises not only from the atom number but also from the ability to tune modes of different cavities independently. Our results establish spatially engineered atomic ensembles as a pathway to selective photon transfer between modes and precise control of many-body complexity.</p>

            <h2>Cavity Optomechanical Probe of Gravity Between Massive Mechanical Oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqian Tang, Wenlong Li, Huanying Sun, Xiaoxia Cai, Tiefu Li, Yulong Liu</p>
            <p>Exploring gravitational interactions between objects with small masses has become increasingly timely. Concurrently, oscillators with masses ranging between milligrams and grams in cavity optomechanical systems sparked interest for probing gravity, and even investigating gravity within macroscopic quantum systems. Here we present a measurement scheme for probing gravity in a microwave optomechanical setup that incorporates periodic gravitational modulation between the test mass and the driven source mass at the milligram scale. Optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) can be utilized to sense the gravitational interactions between test masses and source masses. Specifically, the relative variation in the height of the OMIT peak, expressed as $|1 + re^{i\phi}|^2 - 1$, where $r$ represents the ratio of the amplitude of the gravitational driving force to the radiation pressure force of the probe tone, and $\phi$ denotes their phase difference, can reach up to 2.3\% under plausible experimental conditions. This work may facilitate cavity-optomechanical probing of gravitational coupling between milligram-scale mechanical oscillators, a mass regime where quantum and gravitational effects converge.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Holger Frahm, Sascha Gehrmann, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Ana L. Retore</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\gamma<\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</p>

            <p>We report dielectric and magnetoelectric studies of single-crystalline \ce{CeMgAl11O19}, a Kramers triangular magnet embedded in a polarizable hexaaluminate lattice. In zero magnetic field, the permittivity $\varepsilon'(T)$ follows the Barrett law of a quantum paraelectric down to 25 K, below which a broad minimum develops near 3 K without evidence of static ferroelectric or magnetic order. Application of magnetic fields up to \SI{9}{\tesla} shifts this minimum to higher temperatures and broadens it, evidencing a tunable magnetoelectric this http URL magnetoelectric coupling was characterized using results from magnetization measurements. The anomaly temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\varepsilon'(T)$, exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric systems. This magnetoelectric effect, mediated by spin-orbit-entangled Kramers doublets interacting with a frustrated antipolar liquid, establishes \ce{CeMgAl11O19} as a prototype for exploring quantum magnetoelectricity in frustrated systems.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic RIS-Assisted THz Quantum Networks: Joint Optimization of Entanglement Generation and Fidelity under Channel Impairments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shakil Ahmed</p>
            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) supported by terahertz (THz) wireless links present a transformative alternative to fiber-based infrastructures, particularly in mobile and infrastructure-scarce environments. However, signal attenuation, molecular absorption, and severe propagation losses in THz channels pose significant challenges to reliable quantum state transmission and entanglement distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless QN architecture that leverages adaptive RIS elements capable of switching between active and passive modes based on the incident signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These dynamic RIS elements enhance beamforming control over amplitude and phase, enabling robust redirection and compensation for THz-specific impairments. We develop a detailed analytical model that incorporates key physical layer phenomena in THz quantum links, including path loss, fading, thermal noise, and alignment variations. A secure optimization framework is formulated to jointly determine RIS placement and entanglement generation rate (EGR) allocation, while satisfying fidelity, security, and fairness constraints under diverse quality of service (QoS) demands. The model also includes an exploration of side-channel vulnerabilities arising from dynamic RIS switching patterns. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture yields up to 87\% fidelity enhancement and 65\% fairness improvement compared to static RIS baselines, while maintaining robustness under realistic THz channel conditions. These results underscore the promise of dynamic RIS technology in enabling scalable and adaptive quantum communications over wireless THz links.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mechanics of Stochastic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yurang (Randy)Kuang</p>
            <p>We develop a fundamental framework for the quantum mechanics of stochastic systems (QMSS), showing that classical discrete stochastic processes emerge naturally as perturbations of the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). By constructing exact perturbation potentials that transform QHO eigenstates into stochastic representations, we demonstrate that canonical probability distributions, including Binomial, Negative Binomial, and Poisson, arise from specific modifications of the harmonic potential. Each stochastic system is governed by a Count Operator (N), with probabilities determined by squared amplitudes in a Born-rule-like manner. The framework introduces a complete operator algebra for moment generation and information-theoretic analysis, together with modular projection operators (R_M) that enable finite-dimensional approximations supported by rigorous uniform convergence theorems. This mathematical structure underpins True Uniform Random Number Generation (TURNG) [Kuang, Sci. Rep., 2025], eliminating the need for external whitening processes. Beyond randomness generation, the QMSS framework enables quantum probability engineering: the physical realization of classical distributions through designed quantum perturbations. These results demonstrate that stochastic systems are inherently quantum-mechanical in structure, bridging quantum dynamics, statistical physics, and experimental probability realization.</p>

            <h2>Anti-concentration is (almost) all you need</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Heinrich, Jonas Haferkamp, Ingo Roth, Jonas Helsen</p>
            <p>Until very recently, it was generally believed that the (approximate) 2-design property is strictly stronger than anti-concentration of random quantum circuits, mainly because it was shown that the latter anti-concentrate in logarithmic depth, while the former generally need linear depth circuits. This belief was disproven by recent results which show that so-called relative-error approximate unitary designs can in fact be generated in logarithmic depth, implying anti-concentration. Their result does however not apply to ordinary local random circuits, a gap which we close in this paper, at least for 2-designs. More precisely, we show that anti-concentration of local random quantum circuits already implies that they form relative-error approximate state 2-designs, making them equivalent properties for these ensembles. Our result holds more generally for any random circuit which is invariant under local (single-qubit) unitaries, independent of the architecture.</p>

            <h2>Apparent Universal Behavior in Second Moments of Random Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Belkin, James Allen, Bryan K. Clark</p>
            <p>Just how fast does the brickwork circuit form an approximate 2-design? Is there any difference between anticoncentration and being a 2-design? Does geometry matter? How deep a circuit will I need in practice? We tell you everything you always wanted to know about second moments of random quantum circuits, but were too afraid to compute. Our answers generally take the form of numerical results for up to 50 qubits. Our first contribution is a strategy to determine explicitly the optimal experiment which distinguishes any given ensemble from the Haar measure. With this formula and some computational tricks, we are able to compute $t = 2$ multiplicative errors exactly out to modest system sizes. As expected, we see that most families of circuits form $\epsilon$-approximate $2$-designs in depth proportional to $\log n$. For the 1D brickwork, we work out the leading-order constants explicitly. For graphs, we find some exceptions which are much slower, proving that they require at least $\Omega(n^2)$ gates. This answers a question asked by ref. 1 in the negative. We explain these exceptional architectures in terms of connectedness. Based on this intuition we conjecture universal upper and lower bounds for graph-sampled circuit ensembles. For many architectures, the optimal experiment which determines the multiplicative error corresponds exactly to the collision probability (i.e. anticoncentration). However, we find that the star graph anticoncentrates much faster than it forms an $\epsilon$-approximate $2$-design. Finally, we show that one needs only ten to twenty layers to construct an approximate $2$-design for realistic parameter ranges. This is a large constant-factor improvement over previous constructions. The parallel complete-graph architecture is not quite the fastest scrambler, partially resolving a question raised by ref. 2.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic work capacity of quantum information processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Badhani, Dhanuja G S, Siddhartha Das</p>
            <p>We introduce the resource-theoretic free energy of a quantum channel as the maximal work extractable from the channel as its output equilibrates to a thermal state and its reference system remains locally intact. It is proportional to the relative entropy between the given channel and the absolutely thermal channel. It attains a clear operational meaning as twice the asymptotic rates of athermality distillation and formation under Gibbs preserving superchannels, which map one absolutely thermal channel to another for a given bath, thereby revealing the asymptotic reversibility of the resource theory of athermality for quantum channels. Consequently, we establish that the optimal extractable work in converting one channel to another through the asymptotic athermality distillation and formation tasks equals the difference in their free energies. We call this optimal work the thermodynamic work capacity of channel conversion. Quantum information processing and computing fundamentally concern the manipulation and transformation of quantum channels, which encompass quantum states, their transformations, and measurements. A quantitative characterization of the optimal thermodynamic work gain or expenditure in quantum information processing constitutes a key step toward formulating thermodynamics of quantum processes.</p>

            <p>Harnessing topological effects offers a promising route to protect quantum states of light from imperfections, potentially enabling more robust platforms for quantum information processing. This capability is particularly relevant for active photonic circuits that generate quantum light directly on-chip. Here, we explore topological effects on photon-pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nonlinear waveguide arrays, both theoretically and experimentally. A systematic comparison of homogeneous, trivial, and topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger arrays reveals that only the topological configuration preserves a stable SPDC resonance spectrum under disorder in the tunnel couplings, with fluctuations in the resonance position reduced by more than one order of magnitude. An analytical model supports our experimental observations by linking this robustness to the band-structure properties of the interacting modes. These findings establish quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays as a promising platform to explore the interplay of nonlinearity, topology, and disorder in quantum photonic circuits.</p>

            <h2>A Scalable Superconducting Circuit Framework for Emulating Physics in Hyperbolic Space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xicheng Xu, Ahmed Adel Mahmoud, Noah Gorgichuk, Ronny Thomale, Steven Rayan, Matteo Mariantoni</p>
            <p>Theoretical studies and experiments in the last six years have revealed the potential for novel behaviours and functionalities in device physics through the synthetic engineering of negatively-curved spaces. For instance, recent developments in hyperbolic band theory have unveiled the emergence of higher-dimensional eigenstates -- features fundamentally absent in conventional Euclidean systems. At the same time, superconducting quantum circuits have emerged as a leading platform for quantum analogue emulations and digital simulations in scalable architectures. Here, we introduce a scalable superconducting circuit framework for the analogue quantum emulation of tight-binding models on hyperbolic and kagome-like lattices. Using this approach, we experimentally realize three distinct lattices, including, for the first time to our knowledge, a hyperbolic lattice whose unit cell resides on a genus-3 Riemann surface. Our method encodes the hyperbolic metric directly into capacitive couplings between high-quality superconducting resonators, enabling tenable reproduction of spectral and localization properties while overcoming major scalability and spectral resolution limitations of previous designs. These results set the stage for large-scale experimental studies of hyperbolic materials in condensed matter physics and lay the groundwork for realizing hyperbolic quantum processors, with potential implications for both fundamental physics and quantum computing</p>

            <p>Efficient single-photon emitters are desirable for quantum technologies including quantum networks and photonic quantum computers. We investigate the T centre, a telecommunications-band emitter in silicon, and find a strong isotope dependence of its excited-state lifetime. In particular, the lifetime of the deuterium T centre is over five times longer than the common protium variant. Through explicit first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that this dramatic difference is due to a reduction in the carbon-hydrogen local vibrational mode energy, which suppresses non-radiative decay. Our results imply that the deuterium T centre approaches unit quantum efficiency, enabling more efficient single-photon sources, quantum memories, and entanglement generation.</p>

In this work, we extend the concept of Clifford transformations to fermionic systems. We demonstrate that fermionic Clifford transformations are generated by half-body and pair operators, providing a systematic framework for their characterization. Additionally, we establish connections with fermionic mean-field theories and applications in qubit tapering, offering insights into their broader implications in quantum computing.</p>

Wang</p>
            <p>Periodically driven quantum many-body systems exhibit a wide variety of exotic nonequilibrium phenomena and provide a promising pathway for quantum applications. A fundamental challenge for stabilizing and harnessing these highly entangled states of matter is system heating by energy absorption from the drive. Here, we propose and demonstrate a disorder-free mechanism, dubbed Fock space prethermalization (FSP), to suppress heating. This mechanism divides the Fock-space network into linearly many sparse sub-networks, thereby prolonging the thermalization timescale even for initial states at high energy densities. Using 72 superconducting qubits, we observe an FSP-based time-crystalline order that persists over 120 cycles for generic initial Fock states. The underlying kinetic constraint of approximately conserved domain wall (DW) numbers is identified by measuring site-resolved correlators. Further, we perform finite-size scaling analysis for DW and Fock-space dynamics by varying system sizes, which reveals size-independent regimes for FSP-thermalization crossover and links the dynamical behaviors to the eigenstructure of the Floquet unitary. Our work establishes FSP as a robust mechanism for breaking ergodicity, and paves the way for exploring novel nonequilibrium quantum matter and its applications.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Fidelity of Flux Qubit Measurement in Different Bases via Quantum Flux Parametron</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanjun Ji, Susanna Kirchhoff, Frank K. Wilhelm</p>
            <p>High-fidelity qubit readout is a fundamental requirement for practical quantum computing systems. In this work, we investigate methods to enhance the measurement fidelity of flux qubits via a quantum flux parametron-mediated readout scheme. Through theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we analyze the impact of different measurement bases on fidelity in single-qubit and coupled two-qubit systems. For single-qubit systems, we show that energy bases consistently outperform flux bases in achieving higher fidelity. In coupled two-qubit systems, we explore two measurement models: sequential and simultaneous measurements, both aimed at reading out a single target qubit. Our results indicate that the highest fidelity can be achieved either by performing sequential measurement in a dressed basis over a longer duration or by conducting simultaneous measurement in a bare basis over a shorter duration. Importantly, the sequential measurement model consistently yields more robust and higher fidelity readouts compared to the simultaneous approach. These findings quantify achievable fidelities and provide valuable guidance for optimizing measurement protocols in emerging quantum computing architectures.</p>

We define the global efficiency as the ratio of extractable work (ergotropy) to stored energy, and derive analytical bounds that distinguish, in order of increasing efficiency, regimes characterized by classical squeezing, quantum squeezing without entanglement, and genuine entanglement. Moreover, numerical simulations support the emergence of a similar hierarchy for the thermodynamic efficiency, defined as the ratio between ergotropy and the total thermodynamic cost of the charging process.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenghao Luo, Yi Li, Xingyu Zhao, Zihan Xie, Zehua Tian, Yiheng Lin</p>
            <p>The Unruh effect predicts that an accelerated observer perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath, but its direct observation requires extreme accelerations beyond current experimental reach. Foundational theory [Olson & Ralph, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110404 (2011)] shows that an equivalent thermal response, known as the timelike Unruh effect, can occur for detectors following specific timelike trajectories without acceleration, enabling laboratory tests with stationary yet time-dependent detectors. Here, we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of the timelike Unruh effect in a quantum system of trapped ion, where a two-level spin serves as the detector and is temporally coupled to the ambient field encoded in the ion's vibrational motion. Specifically, we study both excitation and emission dynamics of the detector moving along a spacetime trajectory in the future/past light cone, and demonstrate the thermal response of the detector to the Minkowski vacuum that resembles the Unruh effect. This work establishes a controllable tabletop platform for exploring relativistic quantum physics under accessible laboratory conditions.</p>

            <p>The surface code represents a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to its high error threshold and experimental accessibility with nearest-neighbor interactions. However, current exact surface code threshold analyses are based on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) errors. Though there are numerical studieds for threshold with correlated error, they are only the lower bond ranther than exact value, this offers potential for higher error this http URL, we establish an error-edge map, which allows for the mapping of quantum error correction to a square-octagonal random bond Ising model. We then present the exact threshold under a realistic noise model that combines independent single-qubit errors with correlated errors between nearest-neighbor data qubits. Our method is applicable for any ratio of nearest-neighbor correlated errors to i.i.d. errors. We investigate the error correction threshold of surface codes and we present analytical constraints giving exact value of error threshold. This means that our error threshold is both upper bound and achievable and hence on the one hand the existing numerical threshold values can all be improved to our threshold value, on the other hand, our threshold value is highest achievable value in principle.</p>

            <p>Fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, such as the generation of non-classical states and tests of wavefunction collapse models, are performed on increasingly larger size and mass scales. Highly coherent mechanical resonators, which also prove invaluable in ultrasensitive microscopy methods, are essential tools towards these efforts. Studying these resonators in a thermal equilibrium state at millikelvin temperatures provides a promising path to increase their coherence time. Here, we passively cool a 700 Hz, massive (1.5 ng) mechanical cantilever down to 6.1(4)mK by means of nuclear demagnetization, as confirmed by detecting its thermal motion via a lock-in based detection scheme. At the lowest temperatures the thermal motion of the resonator is still clearly distinguishable from the background noise. Our data analysis confirms that at these temperatures the motion is still thermally distributed. These results pave the way for passiveof cooling low-frequency resonators to the sub-milllikelvin regime, which would enable new tests of quantum mechanics and advances in ultrasensitive force detection.</p>

            <p>Quantum circuit simulators running on classical computers offer a vital platform for designing, testing, and optimizing quantum algorithms, driving innovation despite limited access to real quantum hardware. However, their scalability is inherently constrained by exponential memory and computational overhead, which restricts accurate simulation of large-scale quantum circuits and often results in approximate output distributions. Here, we propose an exact sampling algorithm that integrates tensor network contraction techniques with a Markov process, wherein a classical state evolves according to the local structure of the quantum circuit. As a demonstration, we target the challenge of generating samples from ideal and noisy QAOA circuits with up to 476 qubits, incorporating both depolarizing and amplitude damping noise models. These results enable further validation of several assumptions and conjectures at a scale previously out of reach, significantly expanding the scope of classical simulation in quantum algorithm research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcin Åobejko, Tanmoy Biswas, MichaÅ Horodecki</p>
            <p>The catalytic extension of a discrete two-stroke engine employs a cyclic auxiliary system - the catalyst - that remains decoupled from the baths and performs no work, yet enhances power and efficiency beyond the corresponding non-catalytic counterpart. Theoretical models of discrete engines are relatively easy to analyze but remain challenging for experimental implementation due to the required control over individual strokes. In contrast, externally driven engines that are simultaneously coupled to both heat baths - the so-called continuous engines - are more experimentally feasible. Here, we establish an equivalence between discrete and continuous machines, both with and without a catalyst, by mapping the discrete unitary processes and thermalization steps onto an interaction Hamiltonian and a Markovian model of dissipation. As a result, by replacing probability flows with probability currents, we construct an analogous continuous machine corresponding to previously demonstrated catalytic schemes that generalize Otto engines. We illustrate this mapping for the simplest catalytic extension of the Otto engine, demonstrating catalytic enhancement in the continuous regime.</p>

            <p>The heralded single photons' (HSPs) spectral brightness (SB) is defined as the generation rate per linewidth. As the generation rate of HSPs gets larger or the photons' linewidth becomes narrower, both of which are desirable in quantum information processing using HSPs, does the SB have a limit? We systematically studied the SB and the cross-correlation function, or equivalently, the signal-to-background ratio. The results in this study provide an answer applicable to all types of HSP sources. The answer relies on a newly defined quantity, the quality factor, which reveals how a HSP source approaches the ideal noise-free one. Furthermore, employing the HSP source based on hot atomic vapor, we achieved an SB of (7.0$\pm$0.3)$\times10^5$ pairs/s/MHz and a quality factor of 0.68$\pm$0.02 under the single-photon criterion. Both values are the highest records to date among all kinds of HSP sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anindita Sarkar, Paranjoy Chaki, Priya Ghosh, Ujjwal Sen</p>
            <p>We propose a general framework to compare the values of a physical quantity pertaining to two - or more - physical setups, in the finite-precision scenario. Such a situation requires us to compare between two "patches" on the real line instead of two numbers. Identification of extent of the patches is typically done via standard deviation, as obtained within usual quantum metrological considerations, but can not be always applied, especially for asymmetric error distributions. The extent can however be universally determined by utilizing the concept of percentiles of the probability distribution of the corresponding estimator. As an application, we introduce the concept of finite-precision cooling in a generic quantum system. We use this approach in the working of a three-qubit quantum refrigerator governed by Markovian dynamics, and demonstrate the occurrence of cooling within finite precision for both transient and steady-state regimes, across strong- and weak-coupling limits of the inter-qubit interaction.</p>

            <p>We design and implement a quantum combinatorial reasoning framework for large language models (QCR-LLM), integrating a real quantum computer in the hybrid workflow. QCR-LLM reformulates reasoning aggregation as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem. In this sense, reasoning fragments are represented as binary variables and their interactions encode statistical relevance, logical coherence, and semantic redundancy. We tackle the resulting high-order optimization problem both classically, via simulated annealing, and quantumly through the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimizer (BF-DCQO) executed on IBM's superconducting digital quantum processors. Experiments on BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) benchmarks demonstrate that our QCR-LLM consistently improves reasoning accuracy across multiple LLM backbones, surpassing reasoning-native systems such as o3-high and DeepSeek R1 by up to $+9\,$pp. Despite requiring multiple reasoning samples per query, our QCR-LLM remains approximately five times more energy-efficient than o3-high, owing to the low per-token energy footprint of its GPT-4o backbone. These results constitute the first experimental evidence of quantum-assisted reasoning, showing that hybrid quantum-classical optimization can efficiently enhance reasoning coherence, interpretability, and sustainability in large-scale language models. We have opened the doors to the emergence of quantum intelligence, where harder prompts require quantum optimizers at quantum-advantage level.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks rely on both quantum and classical channels for coordinated operation. Current architectures employ entanglement distribution and key exchange over quantum channels but often assume that classical communication is sufficiently secure. In practice, classical channels protected by traditional cryptography remain vulnerable to quantum adversaries, since large-scale quantum computers could break widely used public-key schemes and reduce the effective security of symmetric cryptography. This perspective presents a quantum-resistant network architecture that secures classical communication with post-quantum cryptographic techniques while supporting entanglement-based communication over quantum channels. Beyond cryptographic protection, the framework incorporates continuous monitoring of both quantum and classical layers, together with orchestration across heterogeneous infrastructures, to ensure end-to-end security. Collectively, these mechanisms provide a pathway toward scalable, robust, and secure quantum networks that remain dependable against both classical and quantum-era threats.</p>

            <h2>A No-Go Theorem for Shaping Quantum Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Alperin</p>
            <p>The ability to independently control higher-order statistical moments of continuous-variable quantum states would allow the direct ``shaping'' of non-Gaussian resources, with wide implications for quantum communication, computation, and metrology. Here we prove that such control is fundamentally impossible under any smooth Hamiltonian dynamics. Within the full infinite-dimensional algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on phase space, the quadratic (symplectic) subalgebra $\mathfrak{sp}(2N,\mathbb R)$ -- and, in the single-mode case, its $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ representation -- is the unique hierarchy-preserving structure: only quadratic generators produce differential operators that terminate at second order and thereby decouple first and second moments from higher cumulants. Any smooth non-quadratic Hamiltonian introduces third- and higher-order derivatives in the phase-space generator, enforcing a universal coupling between the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. This \emph{rigidity of the moment hierarchy} generalizes the Gaussian no-go theorems and identifies the analytic boundary between symplectic (Clifford) dynamics and the non-simulable regime beyond the Gottesman--Knill limit.</p>

            <p>Magic state distillation plays a crucial role in fault-tolerant quantum computation and represents a major bottleneck. In contrast to traditional logical-level distillation, physical-level distillation offers significant overhead reduction by enabling direct implementation with physical gates. Magic state cultivation is a state-of-the-art physical-level distillation protocol that is compatible with the square-grid connectivity and yields high-fidelity magic states. However, it relies on the complex grafted code, which incurs substantial spacetime overhead and complicates practical implementation. In this work, we propose an efficient cultivation-based protocol compatible with the square-grid connectivity. We reduce the spatial overhead by avoiding the grafted code and further reduce the average spacetime overhead by utilizing code expansion and enabling early rejection. Numerical simulations show that, with a color code distance of 3 and a physical error probability of $10^{-3}$, our protocol achieves a logical error probability for the resulting magic state comparable to that of magic state cultivation ($\approx 3 \times 10^{-6}$), while requiring about half the spacetime overhead. Our work provides an efficient and simple distillation protocol suitable for megaquop use cases and early fault-tolerant devices.</p>

            <p>A key challenge for quantum computers is the efficient preparation of many-body entangled states across many qubits. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of matrix product states (MPS) using a renormalization-group(RG)-based quantum algorithm on superconducting quantum hardware. Compared to sequential generation, it has been shown that the RG-based protocol asymptotically prepares short-range correlated MPS with an exponentially shallower circuit depth (when scaling system size), but it is not yet clear for which system sizes it starts to convey an advantage. We thus apply this algorithm to prepare a class of MPS exhibiting a phase transition between a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and a trivial phase for systems of up to 80 qubits. We find that the reduced depth of the RG-based circuits makes them more resilient to noise, and that they generally outperform the sequential circuits for large systems, as we showcase by measuring string-order-like local expectation values and energy densities. We thus demonstrate that the RG-based protocol enables large-scale preparation of MPS and, in particular, SPT-ordered states beyond the fixed point.</p>

In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact this http URL states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent this http URL by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</p>

In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron'' bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation.

            <p>An internal symmetry in a lattice model is said to be onsiteable if it can be disentangled into an onsite action by introducing ancillas and conjugating with a finite-depth circuit. A standard lore holds that onsiteability is equivalent to being anomaly-free, which is indeed valid for finite 0-form symmetries in (1+1)D. However, for higher-form symmetries, these notions become inequivalent: a symmetry may be onsite while still anomalous. In this work, we clarify the conditions for onsiteability of higher-form symmetries by proposing an equivalence between onsiteability and the possibility of $higher$ gauging. For a finite 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D, we show that the symmetry is onsiteable if and only if its 't Hooft anomaly satisfies a specific algebraic condition that ensures the symmetry can be 1-gauged. We further demonstrate that onsiteable 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D can always be brought into transversal Pauli operators by ancillas and circuit conjugation. In generic dimensions, we derive necessary conditions for onsiteability using lattice 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetry, and conjecture a general equivalence between onsiteability and possibility of higher gauging on lattices.</p>

We conjecture that the MIPT is the noninteracting DIII one in this case; the volume-law phase arises through the dangerously irrelevant mass.

Adjacency matrices on large finite clusters of this Cayley graph can be constructed numerically by leveraging the automatic structure of the group. The density of states and two-point functions of the local energy density are approximately computed and consistent with the physics of a generic local Hamiltonian: Gaussian density of states and thermalization of energy density. We then ask what happens to the physics if we modify the group on which the hopping dynamics occurs, and conjecture that adding braid relations into the group leads to integrability.

In the deep inelastic regime, the degree of quantum correlation is governed by the transversity parton distribution functions, providing a novel perspective on spin dynamics within QCD.

We consider a symmetry-compatible refinement of this setting, in which both the superselection criterion and the notion of equivalence between representations are required to respect the $G$-action. Under this stricter notion of equivalence, the sector structure for a $G$-equivariant product representation becomes nontrivial: the $G$-equivariant superselection sectors are classified by elements of the Pontryagin dual $\widehat{G}$. This shows that even in phases without long-range entanglement, imposing symmetry compatibility can lead to nontrivial sector structure.</p>

This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</p>

            <h2>Algorithmic Randomness, Exchangeability, and the Principal Principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey A. Barrett, Eddy Keming Chen</p>
            <p>We introduce a framework uniting algorithmic randomness with exchangeable credences to address foundational questions in philosophy of probability and philosophy of science. To demonstrate its power, we show how one might use the framework to derive the Principal Principle -- the norm that rational credence should match known objective chance -- without circularity. The derivation brings together de Finetti's exchangeability, Martin-LÃ¶f randomness, Lewis's and Skyrms's chance-credence norms, and statistical constraining laws (arXiv:2303.01411). Laws that constrain histories to algorithmically random sequences naturally pair with exchangeable credences encoding inductive symmetries. Using the de Finetti representation theorem, we show that this pairing directly entails the Principal Principle of this framework. We extend the proof to partial exchangeability and provide finite-history bounds that vanish in the infinite limit. The Principal Principle thus emerges as a mathematical consequence of the alignment between nomological constraints and inductive learning. This reveals how algorithmic randomness and exchangeability can illuminate foundational questions about chance, frequency, and rational belief.</p>

            <h2>Bounds on Lorentz-violating parameters in magnetically confined 2D systems: A phenomenological approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>We present a unified, SI-consistent framework to constrain minimal SME coefficients $a_\mu$ and $b_\mu$ using magnetically confined two-dimensional electron systems under a uniform magnetic field. Working in the nonrelativistic (SchrÃ¶dinger--Pauli) limit with effective mass, we derive the radial problem for cylindrical geometries and identify how spatial components ($\mathbf a,\mathbf b$) reshape the effective potential, via $1/r$ and $r$ terms or spin-selective offsets, while scalar components ($a_0,b_0$) act through a global energy shift and a spin-momentum coupling. Phenomenological upper bounds follow from requiring LV-induced shifts to lie below typical spectroscopic resolutions: $|a_0|\lesssim\delta E$, $|b_z|\lesssim\delta E/\hbar$, and compact expressions for $|a_\varphi|$ and $|b_0|$ that expose their dependence on device scales ($r_0$, $B_0$, $\mu$, $m$). Dimensional analysis clarifies that, in this regime, spatial $a_i$ carry momentum dimension and $b_i$ carry inverse-time/length dimensions, ensuring gauge-independent, unit-consistent reporting. Finite-difference eigenvalue calculations validate the scaling laws and illustrate spectral signatures across realistic parameter sets. The results show that scalar sectors (notably $a_0$) are tightly constrained by state-of-the-art $\mu$eV-resolution probes, while spatial and axial sectors benefit from spin- and $m$-resolved spectroscopy and geometric leverage, providing a reproducible pathway to test Lorentz symmetry in condensed-matter platforms.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information science, with profound implications for computing, communication, and metrology. Nuclear scattering processes, dominated by rich spin-dependent interactions, offer a natural platform for generating complex spin entanglement. Here, using proton-proton scattering as a quantum laboratory, we report the emergence of a near-pure Bell-triplet state at a laboratory energy of 151 MeV and a center-of-mass scattering angle of 90 degrees, with the spin amplitude a transition operator connecting two different Bell states. In contrast to the low-energy singlet state governed by the Pauli principle and the S-wave dominance, this second maximally entangled state is directly shaped by tensor forces beyond leading-order chiral effective field theory, providing a distinct quantum-information signature for realistic nuclear forces. These findings, invisible to traditional scattering observables, establish proton-proton scattering as a robust source of triplet entanglement and pave the way for next-generation nuclear Bell tests.</p>

            <h2>Thermally Assisted Supersolidity in a Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changjian Yu, Jinbin Li, Kui-Tian Xi</p>
            <p>Supersolidity in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), which is the coexistence of crystalline density modulation and global phase coherence, emerges from the interplay of contact interactions, long-range dipole-dipole forces, and quantum fluctuations. Although realized experimentally, stabilizing this phase at zero temperature often requires high peak densities. Here we chart the finite-temperature phase behavior of a harmonically trapped dipolar BEC using an extended mean-field framework that incorporates both quantum (Lee-Huang-Yang) and thermal fluctuation effects. We find that finite temperature can act constructively: it shifts the supersolid phase boundary toward larger scattering lengths, lowers the density threshold for the onset of supersolidity, and broadens the stability window of modulated phases. Real-time simulations reveal temperature-driven pathways (crystallization upon heating and melting upon cooling) demonstrating the dynamical accessibility and path dependence of supersolid order. Moreover, moderate thermal fluctuations stabilize single-droplet states that are unstable at zero temperature, expanding the experimentally accessible parameter space. These results identify temperature as a key control parameter for engineering and stabilizing supersolid phases, offering realistic routes for their observation and control in dipolar quantum gases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel S. Oliveira, Cristiano Ciuti</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict the interaction between polaritonic excitations arising from the coupling of a cavity photon mode with bound to continuum intersubband transitions in a doped quantum well. The resulting exciton bound by photon exchange, recently demonstrated experimentally, exhibits a binding energy that can be continuously tuned by varying the cavity frequency. We show that polariton-polariton interactions, originating from both Coulomb interactions and Pauli blocking, can be dramatically enhanced by reducing the exciton binding energy, thereby increasing the effective Bohr radius along the growth direction. This regime is reminiscent of Rydberg atoms, where weak binding leads to strong quantum interactions. Our predictions indicate that this physics can give rise to giant quantum optical nonlinearities in the mid and far infrared, a spectral region that remains largely unexplored in quantum optics and offers exciting opportunities for both fundamental studies and applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Dorau, Albert Much</p>
            <p>We prove that the semiclassical Einstein equations emerge directly from quantum information theory. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a rigorous quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a fundamental role in what is seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>

            <p>Accurately observing the rarefied media of the upper atmosphere, exosphere, and planetary and solar system environments and beyond requires highly sensitive metrological techniques. We present the operating concept and architecture of an in-situ sensing solution based on the dynamics of a levitated nanoparticle (levitodynamics). It can detect and measure impacts of individual particles in rarefied media. Dubbed `LEVITAS', our sensor consists of a dispenser of dielectric nanoparticles and optical trapping of a single nanoparticle in the focus of a laser beam. The trapped nanoparticle constitutes a harmonic oscillator at frequencies in the kilohertz range whose position can be tracked at the standard quantum limit by interferometric detection of the laser photons it scatters. Here, we simulate microcanonical impacts on the nanoparticle and show that the density, velocity, temperature, and composition of the surrounding medium can be estimated accurately. We illustrate the performance of LEVITAS in circumstances ranging from low Earth orbit out to exospheric distances, across which individual impacts can be detected at favourable rates. Furthermore, LEVITAS may be employed to accurately measure highly rarefied neutral distributions within vastly different areas of momentum space. This we demonstrate by simulating the measurement of high-velocity neutral gas particles from the interstellar medium penetrating the heliosphere and flowing through our solar system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijing Bao, Zhenhao Wang, Jia-Rui Luo, Kui-Tian Xi</p>
            <p>We develop a preconditioned nonlinear conjugate-gradient solver for ground states of binary dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation including Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. The optimization is carried out on the product-of-spheres normalization manifold and combines a manifold-preserving analytic line search, derived from a second-order energy expansion and validated along the exact normalized path, with complementary Fourier-space kinetic and real-space diagonal (Hessian-inspired) preconditioners. The method enforces monotonic energy descent and exhibits robust convergence across droplet, stripe, and supersolid regimes while retaining spectrally accurate discretizations and FFT-based evaluation of the dipolar term. In head-to-head benchmarks against imaginary-time evolution on matched grids and tolerances, the solver reduces iteration counts by one to two orders of magnitude and overall time-to-solution, and it typically attains slightly lower energies, indicating improved resilience to metastability. We reproduce representative textures and droplet-stability windows reported for dipolar mixtures. These results establish a reliable and efficient tool for large-scale parameter scans and phase-boundary mapping, and for quantitatively linking numerically obtained metastable branches to experimentally accessible states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pitambar Bagui, Arijit Chatterjee, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla</p>
            <p>Quantum Mpemba effect occurs when a quantum system, residing far away from the steady state, relaxes faster than a relatively nearer state. We look for the presence of this highly counterintuitive effect in the relaxation dynamics of the operators within the open quantum system setting. Since the operators evolve under a non-trace preserving map, the trace distance of an operator is not a monotonically decaying function of time, unlike its quantum state counterpart. Consequently, the trace distance can not serve as a reliable measure for detecting the Mpemba effect in operator dynamics. We circumvent this problem by defining a \textit{dressed} distance between operators that decays monotonically with time, enabling a generalized framework to explore the Mpemba-like effect for operators. Applying the formalism to various open quantum system settings, we find that, interestingly, in the single qubit case, only accelerated relaxation of operators is possible, while genuine Mpemba-like effects emerge in higher-dimensional systems such as qutrits and beyond. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of Mpemba-like effects in nonlocal, non-equilibrium operators, such as current, in a double-quantum-dot setup. Our results, besides offering fundamental insight about the occurrence of the Mpemba-like effect under non-trace preserving dynamics, open avenues for new experimental studies where quicker relaxation of observables could be of significant interest.</p>

These transitions are spin forbidden, resulting in narrow linewidths, and feature near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors. We develop a model of the hyperfine and Zeeman structure that includes coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$ components of $\mathrm{b}^3\Pi_0$. We fit the spectra to obtain rotational and hyperfine coupling constants.

            <p>We investigate long-range resonances in quasiperiodic many-body localized (MBL) systems. Focusing on the Heisenberg chain in a deterministic Aubry-AndrÃ© potential, we complement standard diagnostics by analyzing the structure of long-distance pairwise correlations at high energy. Contrary to the expectation that the ergodic-MBL transition in quasiperiodic systems should be sharper due to the absence of Griffiths regions, we uncover a broad unconventional regime at strong quasiperiodic potential, characterized by fat-tailed distributions of longitudinal correlations at long distance. This reveals the presence of atypical eigenstates with strong long-range correlations in a regime where standard diagnostics indicate stable MBL. We further identify these anomalous eigenstates as quasi-degenerate pairs of resonant cat states, which exhibit entanglement at long distance. These findings advance the understanding of quasiperiodic MBL and identify density-correlation measurements in ultracold atomic systems as a probe of long-range resonances.</p>

With the help of modern quantum statistical mechanics, we take the first step in formalising the hypothesis that quantum measurements are driven by the natural tendency of closed systems to maximize entropy, a notion that we call the Measurement-Equilibration Hypothesis. In this paradigm, we investigate how classical measurement outcomes can emerge within a purely unitary framework, and find that: (i) the interactions used in standard measurement models fail to spontaneously encode information classically and (ii) while ideal projective measurements are impossible, one can (for a given form of Hamiltonian) approximate them exponentially well as more physical systems are collected together into an ``observer'' system. We thus lay the groundwork for self-contained models of quantum measurement, proposing improvements to our simple scheme.</p>

The sampling-based quantum advantages are not known to have efficient verification methods. This paper investigates the verification of quantum advantage from a cryptographic perspective. We establish a strong connection between the verifiability of quantum advantage and cryptographic and complexity primitives, including efficiently samplable, statistically far but computationally indistinguishable pairs of (mixed) quantum states ($\mathsf{EFI}$), pseudorandom states ($\mathsf{PRS}$), and variants of minimum circuit size problems ($\mathsf{MCSP}$). Specifically, we prove that a) a sampling-based quantum advantage is either verifiable or can be used to build $\mathsf{EFI}$ and even $\mathsf{PRS}$ and b) polynomial-time algorithms for a variant of $\mathsf{MCSP}$ would imply efficient verification of quantum advantages. Our work shows that the quest for verifiable quantum advantages may lead to applications of quantum cryptography, and the construction of quantum primitives can provide new insights into the verifiability of quantum advantages.</p>

            <p>Cavity optomechanics, providing an inherently nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, have shown enomerous potential in generating macroscopic quantum entanglement. Here we propose to realize diverse bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics. By introducing magnons to standard cavity optomechanics, not only tunable optomechanical entanglement and magnon-magnon entanglement can be achieved, but also flexible tripartite entanglement including magnon-photon-phonon entanglement, magnon-magnon-photon and -phonon entanglement can be generated. Moreover, optimal bipartite and tripartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning parameters. We further show that all entanglement can be enhanced via engineering the magnon-photon coupling, and is proven to be robust against the bath temperature within the survival temperature. Besides, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be protected or restored by bad magnons with large decay rate, while other entanglement is severely reduced. The results indicate that our proposal provides a novel avenue to explore and control tunable macroscopic quantum effects in hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanics.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce the gauge-fixed QLDPC surgery scheme, an improved logical measurement scheme based on the construction of Cohen et al. (Sci. Adv. 8, eabn1717). Our scheme leverages expansion properties of the Tanner graph to substantially reduce the space overhead of QLDPC surgery. In certain cases, we only require $\Theta(w)$ ancilla qubits to fault-tolerantly measure a weight $w$ logical operator. We provide rigorous analysis for the code distance and fault distance of our schemes, and present a modular decoding algorithm that achieves maximal fault-distance. We further introduce a bridge system to facilitate fault-tolerant joint measurements of logical operators. Augmented by this bridge construction, our scheme can be used to connect different families of QLDPC codes into one universal architecture. Applying our toolbox, we show how to perform all logical Clifford gates on the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code. Our scheme adds 103 ancilla qubits into the connectivity graph, and one of the twelve logical qubits is used as an ancilla for gate synthesis. Logical measurements are combined with the automorphism gates studied by Bravyi et al. (Nature 627, 778-782) to implement 288 Pauli product measurements. We demonstrate the practicality of our scheme through circuit-level noise simulations, leveraging our proposed modular decoder that combines BPOSD with matching.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a widely studied quantum-classical iterative heuristic for combinatorial optimisation. While QAOA targets problems in complexity class NP, the classical optimisation procedure required in every iteration is itself known to be \NP-hard. Still, advantage over classical approaches is suspected for certain scenarios, but nature and origin of its computational power are not yet satisfactorily understood. By introducing means of efficiently and accurately approximating the QAOA optimisation landscape from solution space structures, we derive a new algorithmic variant of unit-depth QAOA for two-level Hamiltonians (including all problems in NP): Instead of performing an iterative quantum-classical computation for each input instance, our non-iterative method is based on a quantum circuit that is instance-independent, but problem-specific. It matches or outperforms unit-depth QAOA for key combinatorial problems, despite reduced computational effort. Our approach is based on proving a long-standing conjecture regarding instance-independent structures in QAOA. By ensuring generality, we link existing empirical observations on QAOA parameter clustering to established approaches in theoretical computer science, and provide a sound foundation for understanding the link between structural properties of solution spaces and quantum optimisation.</p>

            <p>Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems is a crucial task in quantum computing, offering wide-ranging applications but remaining computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. We introduce a new approximation channel for short-time evolution, inspired by the quantum trajectory method, which underpins the efficiency of our algorithms. The first algorithm achieves a gate complexity independent of the number of jump operators, $m$, marking a significant improvement in efficiency. The second algorithm achieves near-optimal dependence on the evolution time $t$ and precision $\epsilon$ and introduces only an additional $\tilde{O}(m)$ factor, which strictly improves upon state-of-the-art gate-based quantum algorithm that has an $\tilde O(m^2)$ factor. The improvement stems from the integration of the new approximation channel with a novel structured linear combination of unitaries method. In both our algorithms, the reduction of dependence on $m$ significantly enhances the efficiency of simulating practical dissipative processes characterized by a large number of jump operators.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], which are generically difficult to simulate classically because of their high entanglement. Here we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in ref. [6], on an array of superconducting qubits. We image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Direct Analysis of Zero-Noise Extrapolation: Polynomial Methods, Error Bounds, and Simultaneous Physical-Algorithmic Error Mitigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pegah Mohammadipour, Xiantao Li</p>
            <p>Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used quantum error mitigation technique that artificially amplifies circuit noise and then extrapolates the results to the noise-free circuit. A common ZNE approach is Richardson extrapolation, which relies on polynomial interpolation. Despite its simplicity, efficient implementations of Richardson extrapolation face several challenges, including approximation errors from the non-polynomial behavior of noise channels, overfitting due to polynomial interpolation, and exponentially amplified measurement noise. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges, presenting bias and variance bounds that quantify approximation errors. Additionally, for any precision $\varepsilon$, our results offer an estimate of the necessary sample complexity. We further extend the analysis to polynomial least squares-based extrapolation, which mitigates measurement noise and avoids overfitting. Finally, we propose a strategy for simultaneously mitigating circuit and algorithmic errors in the Trotter-Suzuki algorithm by jointly scaling the time step size and the noise level. This strategy provides a practical tool to enhance the reliability of near-term quantum computations. We support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</p>

            <h2>Preparing Code States via Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuits: Application to Tetra-Digit Topological Error-Correcting Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Tao Hu, Meng-Yuan Li, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>Demonstrating how long-range entangled states are born from product states has gained much attention, which is not only important for quantum technology but also provides an unconventional tool in characterizing and classifying exotic phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a unified and efficient framework of quantum circuits (i.e., a series of local unitary transformations), termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to construct long-range entangled states (i.e., code states) in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to construct code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we begin with graphical and algebraic demonstration of quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science.

            <h2>Quantifying Irreversibility via Bayesian Subjectivity for Classical & Quantum Linear Maps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lizhuo Liu, Clive Cenxin Aw</p>
            <p>In both classical and quantum physics, irreversible processes are described by maps that contract the space of states. The change in volume has often been taken as a natural quantifier of the amount of irreversibility. In Bayesian inference, loss of information results in the retrodiction for the initial state becoming increasingly influenced by the choice of reference prior. In this paper, we import this latter perspective into physics, by quantifying the irreversibility of any process with its Bayesian subjectivity -- that is, the sensitivity of its retrodiction to one's prior. From this perspective, we review analytical and numerical results that highlight both intuitive and subtle insights that this measure sheds on irreversible processes.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation is a promising way toward practical quantum advantage, but noise in current quantum hardware poses a significant obstacle. We prove that not only the physical error but also the algorithmic error in a single Trotter step decreases exponentially with the circuit depth. This theoretical finding is validated by our numerical results over various Hamiltonians, initial states, and noise channels. Furthermore, we derive the optimal number of Trotter steps and the noise requirement to guarantee total simulation precision. To explicitly show the requirements for robust quantum simulation, we plot a phase diagram of the accumulated error in terms of circuit depth and noise rate. At last, we demonstrate that our improved error analysis leads to significant resourcesaving for fault-tolerant Trotter circuits. By addressing these aspects, this work provides fresh and systematic insight on the practical quantum advantage through quantum simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele Salioni, Rocco Martinazzo, Davide Emilio Galli, Christian Apostoli</p>
            <p>We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ansÃ¤tze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansÃ¤tze.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors based on spin-defect relaxation have become powerful tools for detecting faint magnetic signals, yet their operation has remained largely confined to low magnetic fields and gigahertz frequencies. Extending such sensors into high-field ($> 0.3$ T) and sub-terahertz regimes would enable quantum metrology across a wide range of electromagnetic phenomena and scientific applications, but has proven challenging. Here, we demonstrate that negatively charged boron vacancies ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride can function as relaxation-based quantum sensors operating up to 0.2 terahertz. Their uniform spin-orientation and persistent spin-contrast at high fields enable direct measurement of intrinsic spin relaxation across previously unexplored temperature and frequency regimes. We also reveal a crossover in relaxation behavior \textemdash initially decreasing at low fields before rising at higher fields \textemdash consistent with the emergence of single-phonon-induced resonant noise that becomes significant at sub-terahertz frequencies. These results establish $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ centers as a versatile platform for quantum sensing in the sub-terahertz, high-field regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dian Jing, Pablo Sala, Liang Jiang, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian anyon type. Furthermore, we use Bayesian inference to obtain a statistical mechanics model for fixed-point non-Abelian TOs with perfect measurements under any noise model, which yields the optimal threshold conditioned on measuring anyon syndromes. We numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome measurement, we find a conditioned optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$. Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault tolerance.</p>

            <p>The description of the entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions, including the existence of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), is a challenging problem with conflicting results in the literature. The mapping of the problem onto a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) indicates that relatively large lattice sizes are required to determine the nature of the entanglement entropy (EE) in the thermodynamics limit. Here we address this problem numerically for monitored non-interacting fermions with $U(1)$ symmetry. The use of Graphic-Processing-Unit (GPU) techniques, even with outdated hardware, makes possible to reach much larger lattice sizes ($L = 16384$ and $160\times160$ in one (1d) and two (2d) dimensions respectively) than in previous studies which enables us to characterize quantitatively the entanglement dynamics. In 1d, we show that in order to confirm the absence of a MIPT, for both projective and homodyne measurements, predicted by the NLSM it is necessary to reach $L \sim 10000$. In 2d, also as predicted by the NLSM, we observe for both protocols a MIPT at finite monitoring rate characterized by a scale invariant mutual information. The critical monitoring strength depends on the protocol while the critical exponent $\nu \approx 1.3$ governing the approach to the MIPT is similar in both cases. These features are not correctly predicted by the NLSM. Our results paves the way for a fully quantitative description of the entanglement dynamics of monitoring quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>A Modular, Adaptive, and Scalable Quantum Factoring Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula</p>
            <p>Shor's algorithm for integer factorization offers an exponential speedup over classical methods but remains impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware due to the need for many coherent qubits and very deep circuits. Building on our recent work on adaptive and windowed phase-estimation methods, we have developed a modular, windowed formulation of Shor's algorithm that mitigates these limitations by restructuring phase estimation into shallow, independent circuit blocks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel, followed by lightweight classical postprocessing. This approach allows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from a large number of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for example, three or four phase qubits were sufficient for the computational examples considered in this work), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged. The independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the approach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's formulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism, which introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of phase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in certain regimes. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of the modular formulation while also showing substantial reductions in counting qubits per block.</p>

Applying this framework to qubits undergoing sequences of single- and two-qubit gate operations, we identify specific conditions under which such anomalous work exchanges occur. Furthermore, we analyze the quasiprobabilistic structure of deep quantum circuits and establish a compositional relation linking the work statistics of full circuits to those of their constituent gates. Our work highlights the role of coherence in the thermodynamics of quantum computation and provides a foundation for systematically studying potential thermodynamic relevance of specific quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Recently, proposals for realizing a nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition (SQPT) have been put forward, based on either nonreciprocal interactions between two spin ensembles or the Sagnac-Fizeau shift in a spinning cavity. However, experimental implementation of such a nonreciprocal SQPT remains challenging. This motivates the search for new mechanisms capable of producing a nonreciprocal SQPT. Here, we propose an alternative approach to realize a nonreciprocal SQPT, induced by the magnon Kerr effect (MKE), in a cavity magnonic system, where magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are coupled to cavity photons. The MKE coefficient is positive ($K>0$) when the bias magnetic field is aligned along the crystallographic axis [100], but negative ($K<0$) when aligned along the axis [110]. We show that the steady-state phase diagram for $K > 0$ differs markedly from that for $K < 0$. This contrast is the origin of the nonreciprocal SQPT. By further studying the steady-state magnon occupation and its fluctuations versus the parametric drive strength, we demonstrate that the SQPT becomes nonreciprocal, characterized by distinct critical thresholds for $K > 0$ and $K < 0$. Moreover, we introduce a bidirectional contrast ratio to quantify this nonreciprocal behavior. Our work provides a new mechanism for realizing the nonreciprocal SQPT, with potential applications in designing nonreciprocal quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate superadditivity of quantum capacity through private channels whose Choi-Jamiolkowski operators are private states. This perspective links the security structure of private states to quantum capacity and clarifies the role of the shield system: information encoded in the shield system that would otherwise leak to the environment can be recycled when paired with an assisting channel, thereby boosting capacity. Our main contributions are threefold: Firstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition for capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting channel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and parameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing channels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a single-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private channels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an application, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet unbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private channels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its validity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds with continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that channels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from the set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate (anti-)degradability bounds are not tight. We also revisit the computability of the regularized quantum capacity and modestly suggest that this fundamental question still remains open.</p>

            <p>Routing is the task of permuting qubits in such a way that quantum operations can be parallelized maximally, given constraints on the hardware geometry. When simulating fermions in the Jordan-Wigner encoding with qubits, a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor-connected geometry is effectively imposed on the system, independently of the underlying hardware, which means that naively, an $O(N)$ depth routing overhead is incurred. Recently, Maskara et al. [arXiv:2509.08898] demonstrated that this routing overhead can be reduced to $O(\log N)$ by decomposing general fermion routing into $O(\log N)$ interleave permutations of depth $O(1)$, using $\Theta(N)$ ancillary qubits and employing measurements and feedforward. Here, we exhibit an alternative construction that achieves the same asymptotic performance. We also generalize the result in two ways. Firstly, we show that fermion routing can be performed in depth $O(\log^2 N)$ \emph{without} ancillas, measurements, or feedforward. Secondly, we construct efficient mappings with $O(\log^2 N)$ depth between all product-preserving ternary tree fermionic encodings, thereby showing that fermion routing in any such encoding can be done efficiently. While these results assume all-to-all connectivity, they also imply upper bounds for fermion routing in devices with limited connectivity by multiplying the fermion routing depth by the worst-case qubit routing depth.</p>

            <p>Post-selection strategies that discard low-confidence computational results can significantly improve the effective fidelity of quantum error correction at the cost of reduced acceptance rates, which can be particularly useful for offline resource state generation. Prior work has primarily relied on the "logical gap" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the [[144, 12, 12]] bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%). Additionally, we integrate our approach with the sliding-window framework for real-time decoding, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions that eliminate unnecessary overheads. Notably, its performance matches or even surpasses the original strategy for global decoding, while exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds. Our approach provides a practical foundation for efficient post-selection in fault-tolerant quantum computing with QLDPC codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mao Lin</p>
            <p>The minimum weight matching (MWM) and maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) are two widely used and distinct decoding strategies for quantum error correction. For a given syndrome, the MWM decoder finds the most probable physical error corresponding to the MWM of the decoding graph, whereas MLD aims to find the most probable logical error. Although MLD is the optimal error correction strategy, it is typically more computationally expensive compared to the MWM decoder. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that approximates MLD with $K$ MWMs from the decoding graph. Taking the surface code subject to graphlike errors as an example, we show that it is possible to efficiently find the first $K$ MWMs by systematically modifying the original decoding graph followed by finding the MWMs of the modified graphs. For the case where the $X$ and $Z$ errors are correlated, despite the MWM of the decoding hypergraph cannot be found efficiently, we present a heuristic approach to approximate the MLD by finding the $K$ MWMs in the $X$ and $Z$ subgraphs. We benchmark the efficacy of our algorithm for the surface code subject to graphlike errors, the surface-square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and surface-hexagonal GKP code subject to the Gaussian random displacement errors, showing that the fidelity approaches that of the exact MLD (for the first two cases) or the tensor-network decoder (for the last case) as $K$ increases.</p>

We develop a practical workflow for managing and optimizing this tradeoff, which enables quantum circuit compilation and optimization at scales of hundreds of qubits. Our workflow is able to tackle circuits at such large scales while providing rigorous guarantees on circuit output error by leveraging circuit partitioning and the notion of averaging over circuit ensembles. We demonstrate our workflow on several benchmark algorithmic circuits acting on up to 380 qubits, and show that it can simultaneously achieve substantial reductions in resource-intensive gates and control output errors, offering a practical and scalable strategy for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Object detection and range finding using a weak light source is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks by an intruder. Quantum illumination with nonsimultaneous, phase-insensitive coincidence measurements can provide jamming resilience compared to identical measurements for classical illumination. We extend an experimentally-feasible object detection and range finding quantum illumination-based protocol to include spoofing resilience. This approach allows the system to be characterised by its experimental parameters and quantum states, rather than just its detector data. Therefore we can scope the parameter-space which provides some spoofing resilience without relying upon the prohibitive method of acquiring detector data for all combinations of the experimental parameters. We demonstrate that in certain regimes the intruder has an optimal relative detection basis angle to minimise the induced error. We also show that there are spoofing-vulnerable regimes where excessive background noise prevents any induced error, while it is still possible to perform object detection, i.e. our detectors have not been fully blinded. The sensing protocol which we describe can allow for the recognition of intrusion and the possible detection of our trustworthy return signal. Our results reinforce that quantum illumination is advantageous for spoofing resilience compared to a classical illumination-based protocol.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Johansson, Dennis LÃ¶nard, Isabel Cardoso Barbosa, Jonas Gutsche, Jonas Witzenrath, Artur Widera</p>
            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of $1.25 \mathrm{mm}$. On its tip, a direct laser writing process is used to fixate a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise-limited magnetic-field sensitivity of $5.9 \mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \mathrm{\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \mathrm{mW}$. Using lock-in techniques, we measure a sensitivity of $51.8 \mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. Moreover, controlled guiding of excitation light to the diamond while avoiding sample illumination may enable operation in light-sensitive environments such as biological tissue. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Field Measurements in the Fewster-Verch Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Mandrysch, Miguel NavascuÃ©s</p>
            <p>The Fewster-Verch (FV) framework provides a local and covariant approach for defining measurements in quantum field theory (QFT). Within this framework, a probe QFT represents the measurement device, which, after interacting with the target QFT, undergoes an arbitrary local measurement. Remarkably, the FV framework is free from Sorkin-like causal paradoxes and robust enough to enable quantum state tomography. However, two open issues remain. First, it is unclear if the FV framework allows conducting arbitrary local measurements. Second, if the probe field is interpreted as physical and the FV framework as fundamental, then one must demand the probe measurement to be itself implementable within the framework. That would involve a new probe, which should also be subject to an FV measurement, and so on. It is unknown if there exist non-trivial FV measurements for which such an ``FV-Heisenberg cut" can be moved arbitrarily far away. In this work, we advance the first problem by proving that Gaussian-modulated measurements of locally smeared fields fit within the FV framework. We solve the second problem by showing that any such measurement admits a movable FV-Heisenberg cut. As a technical byproduct, we establish that state transformations induced by finite-rank perturbations of the classical phase space underlying a linear scalar field preserve the Hadamard property.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Kurtscheid, Andreas Redmann, Frank Vewinger, Julian Schmitt, Martin Weitz</p>
            <p>The coupling of two-level quantum systems to the thermal environment is a fundamental problem, with applications ranging from qubit state preparation to spin models. However, for the elementary problem of the thermodynamics of an ensemble of bosons populating a two-level system despite its conceptual simplicity experimental realizations are scarce. Using an optical dye microcavity platform, we thermalize photons in a two-mode system with tunable chemical potential, demonstrating N bosons populating a two-level system coupled to a heat bath. Under pulsed excitation, Josephson oscillations between the two quantum states demonstrate the possibility for coherent manipulation. In contrast, under stationary conditions the thermalization of the two-mode system is observed. As the energetic splitting between eigenstates is two orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energy, at low occupations an almost equal distribution of the modes occupation is observed, as expected from Boltzmann statistics. For larger occupation, we observe efficient population of the ground state and saturation of the upper level at high filling, expected from quantum statistics. Our experiment holds promise for state preparation in quantum technologies as well as for quantum thermodynamics studies.</p>

            <h2>Stability of Floquet sidebands and quantum coherence in 1D strongly interacting spinless fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karun Gadge, Salvatore R. Manmana</p>
            <p>For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly computing time-dependent single-particle spectral functions using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS). We study interacting metallic and correlated insulating phases in a chain of correlated spinless fermions. At high-frequency driving we obtain clearly separated, long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum. However, if there is significant overlap of the features, which is more probable in the low-frequency regime, the interactions lead to strong heating, which results in a significant loss of quantum coherence and of the FBs. Similar suppression of FBs is obtained in the presence of noise. The emerging picture is further elucidated by the behavior of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.</p>

            <h2>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaya Kunimi, Yusuke Kato, Hosho Katsura</p>
            <p>We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states while increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.</p>

            <h2>A simpler probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in closed systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filiberto Ares, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese</p>
            <p>We study the local relaxation of closed quantum systems through the relative entropy between the reduced density matrix and its long time limit. We show, using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a significant computational advantage. We go on to relate this to the entanglement asymmetry of the subsystem with respect to time translation invariance. In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states.</p>

            <h2>Krylov exponents and power spectra for maximal quantum chaos: an EFT approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saskia Demulder, Maria Knysh, Andrew Rolph</p>
            <p>We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas SchÃ¼rmann</p>
            <p>We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p r \ge \hbar/2$. Under the same assumption, a vector-field Barta-type argument improves this universal floor to the scale-invariant bound $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, which provides a universal, foliation-independent floor. Any further sharpening of the constant requires eigenvalue-comparison results or other curvature-sensitive methods.</p>

            <h2>On the invariants of finite groups arising in a topological quantum field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher A. Schroeder, Hung P. Tong-Viet</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate structural properties of finite groups that are detected by certain group invariants arising from Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, in one space and one time dimension. In this setting, each finite group $G$ determines a family of numerical invariants associated with closed orientable surfaces, expressed in terms of the degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$. These invariants can be viewed as natural extensions of the commuting probability $d(G)$, which measures the likelihood that two randomly chosen elements of $G$ commute and has been extensively studied in the literature. By analyzing these higher-genus analogues, we establish new quantitative criteria relating the values of these invariants to key structural features of finite groups, such as commutativity, nilpotency, supersolvability and solvability. Our results generalize several classical theorems concerning the commuting probability, thereby linking ideas from finite group theory and topological quantum field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su</p>
            <p>We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path. Our results extend naturally to higher-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, providing a unified framework for bosonic and fermionic dualities and offering new insights for quantum computation and simulation.</p>

            <p>Characterization of quantum measurements and dynamical processes is typically performed using pure state preparations. However, in realistic experimental settings, the preparation of pure states is often infeasible due to noise and system constraints. In this work, we present a unified framework that enables the direct and complete characterization of an unknown Kraus operator using only a single input state. The same framework also supports the characterization of unknown observable, unitary operator, and density matrix. Remarkably, all these tasks are accomplished using a single input state, a set of projector-based unitary evolution operators, and the measurement of a single observable. Importantly, our approach imposes no constraints on the strength of the coupling between the system and a probe.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He-Ran Wang, Ilya Vilkoviskiy, Dmitry A. Abanin</p>
            <p>The influence matrix (IM) provides a powerful framework for characterizing nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics by encoding multitime correlations into tensor-network states. Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.</p>

The evolution of quantum states is evaluated via eigenvalue dynamics of a general Hamiltonian system, perturbed by a parametrically evolving variable $\lambda(t)$ that carries the time-dependence. This is achieved using the Pechukas-Yukawa mapping of the evolution of the energy levels governed by their initial conditions on a generalised Calogero-Sutherland model of a 1D classical gas. As such, quantum systems can be described exactly in their entirety from eigenvalue dynamics. Under this description, we provide an improved understanding of the relationship between nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions and decoherence which has significant impacts to a wide range of applications.</p>

            <p>In Si/SiGe quantum dots, the decoherence behavior of spin qubits usually comes from the non-Markovian effect of the charge noise. To improve the performance of using the coherent noise models in the decoherence simulation and tomography analysis, here we propose a spin-phonon model derived from the electric dipole spin resonance to characterize the decoherence behavior of the spin qubit in a Si/SiGe quantum dot. Utilizing a 1/f spectrum to characterize quantum noise correlation, our stochastic model can yield a more precise prediction of decoherence compared to a random coherence model. We also use gate set tomography (GST) to address the error generator and analyze the model violation coming from the non-Markovian effect. Based on the results, we attribute certain error generators of this model to the incoherence error, which avoids the scenario of using too large a coherent noise strength in the previous study to account for the experimentally observed decoherence times, and thus underestimates the gate fidelity. We also perform a gate optimization and show that our optimized control pulse can substantially reduce the error contribution of the incoherent non-Markovian 1/f charge noise. We further demonstrate that the optimized pulse against incoherent noise is more robust against coherent noise than the regular Gaussian pulse through a filter function analysis in a CPMG protocol, demonstrating the significant effectiveness of the optimized pulse.</p>

            <p>Bosonic codes represent a promising route toward quantum error correction in continuous-variable systems, with direct relevance to experimental platforms such as circuit QED and optomechanics. However, their preparation and stabilization remain highly challenging, requiring ultra-precise control of nonlinear interactions to create entangled superpositions, suppress decoherence, and mitigate dynamic errors. Here, we introduce a reinforcement-learning-assisted Floquet engineering approach for the autonomous preparation of bosonic codes that is general, efficient, and noise-resilient. By leveraging machine learning to optimize Floquet driving parameters, our method achieves over two orders of magnitude reduction in evolution time-requiring only about one percent of that in conventional adiabatic schemes-while maintaining high-fidelity state generation even under strong dissipative and dephasing noise. This approach not only demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence in quantum control but also establishes a scalable and experimentally feasible route toward fault-tolerant bosonic quantum computation. Beyond the specific application to bosonic code preparation, our results suggest a general paradigm for integrating machine learning and Floquet engineering to overcome decoherence challenges in next-generation quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Single-photon superradiance and subradiance in helical collectives of quantum emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamza Patwa, Philip Kurian</p>
            <p>Collective emission of light from distributions of two-level systems (TLSs) was first predicted in 1954 by Robert Dicke, who showed that when $N$ quantum emitters absorb photons, their collective radiative decay rate can be enhanced (superradiance) or suppressed (subradiance) relative to a single emitter. In this work, we derive novel analytical expressions for the collective decay rates and Lamb shifts for the interaction of a single photon with a continuous distribution of TLSs on an infinite line and an infinite helix. We compare these solutions to collectives of TLSs on a cylinder, finding limits in which the eigenvalues of structures of different dimensions are equal. We also compare our solution with arrangements where the emitter distribution is discrete rather than continuous, and when short- ($1/r^3$), intermediate- ($1/r^2$), and long-range ($1/r$) interaction terms are included. We find important differences between the discrete vector and continuous scalar emitter cases, which do not agree in the limit where discrete spacing goes to 0. The analytical solution for the helix is then used to make estimates of the maximally superradiant state, thermally averaged collective decay rate, and percentage of trapped states of quantum emitter architectures in protein fibers. Given the differences between our idealized infinite helix and the numerical model describing protein fibers, our analytical estimates show excellent agreement with the numerical results for sparse arrangements of emitters in protein fibers. Our work thus bridges the gap between different formalisms for superradiance, aids the engineering of devices which harness quantum optical effects for computing with superradiant error correction and subradiant memories, and motivates the discovery and creation of flexible platforms for quantum information processing using the intrinsic helical geometries of biomatter.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate both the generation and detection of an ultra-high flux of polarization Bell states using broadband hyper-entangled bi-photons that are quantum-correlated in both polarization and time-energy. Bell states of polarization embody the most basic form of two-state entanglement, and are a key component of quantum protocols of communication and sensing. High-speed generation, processing and detection of polarization Bell-states is therefore critical for quantum technology. However, all current protocols that employ polarization entangled photons are inherently slow, primarily due to the photo-detectors (Photomultiplier tubes, avalanche photo-diodes, etc.) that can handle only $10^{6-7}$ photons/s, whereas sources may easily produce $10^{10-13}$ photons/s or more (if properly designed). We fully alleviate this detection bottleneck by resorting to physical detection of the bi-photons with nonlinear interferometry. We harness a generalized, dual polarization SU1,1 interferometer to generate, manipulate \textit{and measure} all the triplet Bell-states at a flux of $\sim\!5\times10^{11}$ photons/s, enhancing the speed of quantum processing by >5 orders of magnitude compared to standard methods.</p>

Although several experimental demonstrations have been reported, the achievable coincidence rates have so far remained limited.

In this work, we employ 16-pixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) to mitigate the impact of detector dead time. Consequently, we achieve coincidence rates exceeding 3 million counts per second (Mcps) in two-photon interference and CHSH inequality experiments using 5-GHz clocked sequential time-bin entangled photon pair source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of multi-Mcps coincidence detection of entangled photons, paving the way for high-speed entangled-photon-based quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent claims, we revisit how coherent perfect absorption (CPA) influences cavity and polaritonic linewidths. Using standard input output theory and measurements on single port bare microwave cavities and cavity magnon hybrids, we find that CPA drives the on resonance reflection to zero while the spectral width remains set by the total decay rate. Apparent narrowing observed near CPA is found to be a visual artifact that does not remain upon quantitative analysis. Extending the analysis to cavity magnomechanics, we show that logarithmic plots can exhibit apparent polaromechanical normal mode splitting, whereas linear scale spectra display no true splitting. These results clarify when CPA modifies amplitudes versus spectral poles, offer practical guidance for data presentation, and indicate that CPA alone is not a route to linewidth suppression or polaromechanical mode splitting in the linear, weak-probe regime.</p>

Two complementary regimes are analyzed: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, which yields a universal negative $T^4$ correction to the quantized heat flux and a corresponding convex cubic term in the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, producing a crossover from $T^4$ to $T^{3/2}$ scaling and a change of sign in the correction. The resulting backaction reduces the plasmon group velocity and can suppress the apparent thermal conductance by an amount consistent with experiment. Importantly, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit in the plasmon contribution corresponds to an induced energy flow within the compressible strip, representing a form of heat drag between chiral and nonchiral modes. The framework thus provides a microscopic and quantitatively plausible explanation of the ``missing heat flux'' anomaly observed at QH edges and links its transport signature to the nonlinearity of the plasmon spectrum.</p>

We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases.

            <h2>Binary gravitational waves as probes of quantum graviton states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sugumi Kanno, Jiro Soda, Akira Taniguchi</p>
            <p>It is well known that the most reliable way to reveal the quantum nature of light is through photon number statistics, since photons exhibiting sub-Poissonian statistics unambiguously demonstrate their quantum behavior. In this paper, we show that gravitons emitted by binary systems can, in principle, exhibit analogous sub-Poissonian statistics. The key idea is that the vacuum state of gravitons may not be the standard Minkowski vacuum but rather a nonclassical state imprinted with the physics of the early Universe, such as inflation. Accordingly, gravitational waves from binary systems provide a means to probe the graviton states generated in the early Universe. As a concrete example, we show that squeezed graviton states originating from inflation may be detected through the observation of gravitational waves from binary systems.</p>

            <h2>Cost of Simulating Entanglement in Steering Scenario</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujie Zhang, Jiaxuan Zhang, Eric Chitambar</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, yet certain entangled states that are unsteerable can be classically simulated in steering scenarios, making them unable to exhibit quantum steering. Despite their significance, a systematic comparison of such entangled states has not been explored. In this work, we quantify the resource content of unsteerable quantum states in terms of the amount of shared randomness required to simulate the assemblages they generate in the steering scenario. We rigorously demonstrate that the simulation cost is unbounded even for certain unsteerable two-qubit states. Moreover, the simulation cost of entangled two-qubit states is always strictly larger than that for any separable state. A significant portion of our results rests on the relationship between the simulation cost of two-qubit Werner states and that of noisy spin measurements. Using noisy spin measurements as our central example, we also investigate the minimum number of outcomes a parent measurement requires to simulate a given set of compatible measurements. Although certain continuous measurement families admit a finite-outcome parent measurement, we identify scenarios where the simulation cost is unbounded. Our results establish previously unknown lower bounds and upper bounds on the shared randomness simulation cost, supported by connections between the simulation cost of noisy spin measurements and various geometric inequalities, including ones from the zonotope approximation problem in Banach space theory.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase transitions reveal deep insights into the behavior of many-body quantum systems, but identifying these transitions without well-defined order parameters remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to constructing phase diagrams using the vector field of the reduced fidelity susceptibility (RFS). This method maps quantum phases and formulates an optimization problem to discover observables corresponding to order parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to well-established models, including the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Interaction (ANNNI) model, a cluster state model, and a chain of Rydberg atoms. By analyzing observable decompositions into eigen-projectors and finite-size scaling, our method successfully identifies order parameters and characterizes quantum phase transitions with high precision. Our results provide a powerful tool for exploring quantum phases in systems where conventional order parameters are not readily available.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyang He, Alexander Cowtan, Dominic J. Williamson, Theodore J. Yoder</p>
            <p>In pursuit of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation, quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been established as promising candidates for low-overhead memory when compared to conventional approaches based on surface codes. Performing fault-tolerant logical computation on QLDPC memory, however, has been a long standing challenge in theory and in practice. In this work, we propose a new primitive, which we call an $\textit{extractor system}$, that can augment any QLDPC memory into a computational block well-suited for Pauli-based computation. In particular, any logical Pauli operator supported on the memory can be fault-tolerantly measured in one logical cycle, consisting of $O(d)$ physical syndrome measurement cycles, without rearranging qubit connectivity. We further propose a fixed-connectivity, LDPC architecture built by connecting many extractor-augmented computational (EAC) blocks with bridge systems. When combined with any user-defined source of high fidelity $|T\rangle$ states, our architecture can implement universal quantum circuits via parallel logical measurements, such that all single-block Clifford gates are compiled away. The size of an extractor on an $n$ qubit code is $\tilde{O}(n)$, where the precise overhead has immense room for practical optimizations.</p>

            <h2>PT symmetry and the square well potential: Antilinear symmetry rather than Hermiticity in scattering processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip D. Mannheim</p>
            <p>While a Hamiltonian with a real potential acts as a Hermitian operator when it operates on bound states, it produces resonances with complex energies in a scattering experiment. The scattering states are not square integrable, being instead delta function normalized. This lack of square integrability breaks the connection between Hermiticity and real eigenvalues, to thus allow for real bound state sector eigenvalues and complex scattering sector eigenvalues. When written as contour integrals delta functions take support in the complex plane, with the scattering amplitude taking support in the complex energy plane too. However, the scattering amplitude is $CPT$ symmetric (or $PT$ symmetric if $C$ is conserved), regardless of whether or not states are square integrable. For resonance scattering this antilinear symmetry requires the presence of a complex conjugate pair of energies, one to describe the excitation of the resonance and the other to describe its decay, with it being their interplay that enforces probability conservation. Each complex pair of energy eigenvalues corresponds to only one observable resonance not two, to thus modify the standard pure decaying complex energy pole discussion of resonances. We show that the non-relativistic square-well problem with a real potential possesses $PT$ symmetry in both the bound and scattering sectors, with there being complex conjugate pairs of energy eigenvalues in the scattering sector. Despite this there is just the same number of observable resonances as in the pure decaying sector. We show that the square-well scattering threshold branch point is an exceptional point (a characteristic of antilinear symmetry) at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. The square-well potential thus provides an explicit realization of how antlinearity is more general than Hermiticity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas SÃ¡, Benjamin BÃ©ri</p>
            <p>We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting ``gamma-matrix'' spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. However, we identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</p>

In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</p>

Application to a three-level quantum maser illustrates the framework in a concrete setting.

            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement-assisted synchronization framework for indoor optical wireless systems based on grid-based beam steering. A central transmitter equipped with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source emits time-energy entangled photon pairs, directing user photons toward spatially defined grids based on estimated user positions, while retaining reference photons for timestamping. The room is partitioned into multiple beam-aligned regions, and photon reception probability is analytically modeled using local coordinate transformations and Gaussian beam optics. To address the inherent sparsity and randomness of photon detection, we develop a robust two-stage synchronization algorithm that performs sparse bit-pattern matching and timestamp averaging to estimate timing offsets. Monte Carlo simulations are then performed to evaluate the impact of synchronization duration, grid resolution, and photon-pair generation rate on synchronization accuracy. Results show that finer grid configurations and optimal photon-pair rates significantly reduce synchronization error, achieving sub-10 ps timing accuracy within 1 ms of synchronization time. The proposed approach enables scalable, high-precision quantum synchronization in wireless indoor environments, laying the groundwork for future joint quantum communication, sensing, and positioning systems.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Jie Huang, Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Yanzhu Chen</p>
            <p>In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.</p>

            <h2>Local-to-Global Entanglement Dynamics by Periodically Driving Impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Xing Lin, Abhinav Prem, Shinsei Ryu, Bastien Lapierre</p>
            <p>We study the entanglement dynamics of a one-dimensional spin chain subject to a local Floquet drive of a two-site impurity. We uncover a sharp transition in the entanglement dynamics as a function of the driving frequency. For large drive periods $T$, we observe a linear growth in entanglement entropy (EE), indicating a heating phase with volume law entanglement. Surprisingly, for driving periods below a critical value $T_\ast$, the EE grows subextensively with time, characteristic of a local quantum quench. In the non-interacting limit, we analytically trace the origin of this phenomenon to a transition in the single-particle Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We also find that for $T>T_*$, the so-called ``average energy" operator develops non-local, rainbow-like couplings that are responsible for the rapid entanglement growth in the heating phase, but remains local for $T<T_*$. Using extensive matrix-product-state simulations, we show that the non-heating phase and the subextensive entanglement growth persist in the presence of weak interactions for numerically accessible timescales. Our results establish that local Floquet engineering can generate emergent bulk phenomena, shedding new light on energy localization and thermalization in driven many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Zahariev, Mark S. Gordon</p>
            <p>The development of quantum computing for molecular simulations is constrained by the limited number of qubits available on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The present work introduces the Virtual Orbital Fragmentation (FVO) method, a systematic approach that reduces qubit requirements by 40--66\% while maintaining chemical accuracy. The method partitions the virtual orbital space into chemically intuitive fragments and employs many-body expansion techniques analogous to spatial fragmentation methods. Applications to six molecular systems demonstrate that the 2-body FVO expansion achieves errors below 3 kcal/mol, while the 3-body expansion provides sub-kcal/mol accuracy. When integrated with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and combined with the Effective Fragment Molecular Orbital (EFMO) method for multi-molecular systems, the hierarchical Q-EFMO-FVO approach achieves 96--100\% accuracy relative to full calculations. The method provides a practical pathway for quantum chemical calculations on current 50--100 qubit processors and establishes virtual orbital fragmentation as a complementary strategy to spatial fragmentation for managing quantum computational complexity.</p>

Here, we use a two-terminal quantum junction to derive a thermodynamically consistent global master equation. We demonstrate that the associated heat current, a key nonlocal observable in any quantum thermal machine, also approaches zero in this extreme coupling scenario, underscoring the role of virtual photons in the vacuum ground state. Our results indicate that the decoupling is a more general feature of the DSC regime, with implications for quantum thermotronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sameer Dambal, Akira Sone, Yu Zhang</p>
            <p>Simulating open quantum systems on quantum computers presents a fundamental challenge: open quantum dynamics are intrinsically nonunitary, whereas quantum computers operate through unitary evolution. Conventional approaches overcome this mismatch by encoding nonunitary processes into unitary circuits, but such methods incur substantial overhead in both qubits and gates. Here, we propose an alternative perspective. Quantum processors are themselves open systems, inherently subject to noise. Instead of correcting all errors and then encoding nonunitary dynamics with unitary logical qubits and gates, we show how noise can be harnessed as a computational resource. We develop a noise-assisted quantum algorithm that selectively preserves physical noise to emulate nonunitary channels, enabling efficient simulation of open quantum dynamics with minimal qubit requirements. Our approach applies both to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant architectures. By leveraging intrinsic noise, this method circumvents the need to encode nonunitary dynamics into unitary gates and relaxes fidelity requirements on physical qubits, thereby reducing the overhead of quantum error correction. This framework reframes noise from a limitation into a resource, opening new directions for practical quantum simulation of open systems</p>

            <p>Thermal noise is one of the physical obstacles that constrain the achievable detection sensitivities of various detectors. Indeed, as we showed in a recent paper (PRB 111, 024501 (2025)), the usual Josephson threshold detector (JTD) operated in an equilibrium state can be utilized to implement a weak microwave signal, just approaching (but not arriving at) its energy quantum limit, even though its physical parameters have been optimized. In this letter, we further demonstrate numerically that the phase dynamics of a current-biased Josephson junction (CBJJ) can be insensitive to the always-on thermal noise if the sweep rate of the biased current is significantly high. As a consequence, the JTD can be operated alternatively in a non-equilibrium state. Based on the statistical binary detection criterion, we demonstrate how such a non-equilibrium JTD (NEJTD) can be utilized to implement the weak microwave signal, arriving at its energy quantum limit level. The dynamic range and photon-number resolvability of the proposed NEJTD are also discussed when it serves as a broadband single microwave-photon detector.</p>

            <p>Post-selecting against quantum jumps into the ground state confines the evolution of the three-level system to the excited states manifold, effectively realizing a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian qubit. In this work, by introducing post-selection efficiencies for both decay channels, the second-excited to first-excited and the first-excited to ground-state transitions, we formulate a hybrid-Liouvillian framework that captures the unmonitored dynamics of the non-Hermitian qubit. We find that the decoherence effects arising from quantum jumps within the second-excited and first-excited manifold also manifest under inefficient post-selection of the second-excited to first-excited transitions, thereby modifying the spectral properties of the Liouvillian and leading to a splitting of the exceptional points. A comparative analysis shows that the trajectory-based approach, obtained by ensemble-averaging stochastic measurement trajectories generated via the Bayesian state update rule, and the Lindblad evolution remain consistent. Our results highlight the fundamental role of measurement inefficiency in realizing post-selection-based non-Hermitian qubits and in shaping the structure of Liouvillian exceptional points. These findings provide new insights into how inefficient measurement processes influence non-Hermitian behavior in open quantum systems.</p>

Second, building upon these foundations, we introduce the iQTransformer, a novel quantum transformer architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism within the iTransformer framework, enabling a quantum-native representation of inter-variable relationships. Third, we provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that quantum-based models may achieve competitive or superior forecasting accuracy with fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence than state-of-the-art classical and quantum baselines in some cases. These contributions highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced architectures as efficient and scalable tools for advancing multivariate time-series forecasting.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with complex eigenenergies are useful tools for describing the dynamics of open quantum systems. In particular, parity and time (\PT) symmetric Hamiltonians have generated interest due to the emergence of exceptional-point degeneracies, where both eigenenergies and eigenvectors coalesce as the energy spectrum transitions from real- to complex-valued. Because of the abrupt spectral response near exceptional points, such systems have been proposed as candidates for precision quantum sensing. In this work, we emulate a passive \PT~dimer using a two-mode, non-Hermitian system of superconducting qubits comprising one high-coherence qubit coupled to an intentionally lossy qubit via a tunable coupler. The loss is introduced by strongly coupling the qubit to a continuum of photonic modes in an open waveguide environment. Using both pulsed and continuous-wave measurements, we characterize the system dynamics near the exceptional point. We observe a behavior broadly consistent with an ideal passive \PT~dimer with some corrections due to the tunable coupler element. We extract the complex eigenenergies associated with the two modes and calculate the sensitivity as a function of the coupling strength. Confirming theoretical predictions, we observe no sensitivity enhancement near the quantum exceptional point.

Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time, revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling the BEC-droplet transition with Rayleigh superradiant scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mithilesh K. Parit, Mingchen Huang, Ziting Chen, Yifei He, Haoting Zhen, Gyu-Boong Jo</p>
            <p>Light scattering plays an essential role in uncovering the properties of quantum states through light-matter interactions. Here, we explore the transition from Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to droplets in a dipolar $^{166}$Er gas by employing superradiant light scattering as both a probing and controlling tool. We observe that the efficiency of superradiant scattering exhibits a non-monotonic behavior akin to the rate of sample expansion during the transition, signaling its sensitivity to the initial quantum state, and in turn, revealing the BEC-droplet transition. Through controlled atom depletion via superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio to identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian variational ansatz calculations. Finally, using these two approaches, we track how the BEC-droplet transition points shift under varying magnetic field orientations. Our work opens new avenues for studying quantum states through superradiance, advancing our understanding of both the BEC-droplet crossover and its coherence properties.</p>

            <p>Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation conditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and two-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\sim$95 %) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a shortened exciton decay time ($\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient exciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both excitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in a highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized exciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and biexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of biexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report that, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton state without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications.</p>

In multipartite quantum systems, there are two kinds of quantum entanglement: $k$-nonseparability and $k$-partite entanglement.

Examples are given to demonstrate the detection capability and advantages of these criteria.

            <p>Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Kanti Giri, Pochung Chen</p>
            <p>Flat-band systems offer a uniquely powerful tool for quantum control in dynamics due to their characteristic feature of having a dispersionless energy band. Simulating such highly sensitive systems on current digital quantum computers is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic limitations of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Here we present high-fidelity digital quantum simulations of flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (ABF) lattices, using an advanced tensor-network-based circuit compression method. With the compressed quantum circuits, we first explore single-particle dynamics and observe two distinct behaviours: strong localization in ABF lattices and delocalization in FB lattices. By integrating FB and ABF lattices into a one-dimensional hybrid structure, we achieve controllable quantum transport, where the ABF lattice acts as a quantum switch. Extending to two-particle dynamics, we show that transport remains controllable by tuning the hopping amplitude alone, even in the presence of interactions. These results establish flat-band engineered systems as a promising pathway for scalable control of quantum transport in emerging quantum technologies, with potential applications in qubit isolation, particle trapping, and state transfer.</p>

            <h2>Breaking of scale invariance in a strongly dipolar 2D Bose gas</h2>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70Â°, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computers. One requirement to create a quantum processor is nonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by sandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a Josephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that hinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum necessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead to dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for high-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations using a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator transition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit its thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link employing only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our weak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured anharmonicity of $\alpha/2\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is $\kappa/2\pi = 15 \mathrm{\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium nitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and the fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material interfaces and capacitances. The investigation of small patches of material near the SIT can shed new light on the nature of the transition, including the role of dissipation and finite-size effects.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the emergence of quantum nonlinearities in the optical response of lattices of two-level quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser. For subwavelength lattice periods, where the system behaves as a quantum metasurface, we find that a resonant incident plane wave can populate excitonic Bloch states with parallel wavevectors different from the incident field, including those lying outside the light cone. Closely related to resonance fluorescence, the far-field emission from the system in the strong-driving regime is dominated by a broadband background of photons spanning a wide range of frequencies and wavevectors. Moreover, we show that, for periods approaching the driving wavelength, the emitter lattice enters in a bistable regime due to the renormalization of the driving rate, in striking contrast with its classical (bosonic) analog. This bistable behavior enables the selective activation and deactivation of the optical quantum nonlinearities of the system.</p>

            <p>Open quantum systems host a wide range of intriguing phenomena, yet their simulation on well-controlled quantum devices is challenging, owing to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the inherently non-unitary nature of the dynamics. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a variational quantum algorithm capable of scalable simulation of non-unitary many-body dissipative dynamics. The algorithm builds on the framework of linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation, which converts non-unitary dynamics into a weighted sum of unitary evolutions. With the further introduction of a simplified quantum circuit for loss-function evaluation, our scheme is suitable for near-term quantum hardware, with the circuit depth independent of the simulation time. We illustrate our scheme by simulating the collective dynamics of a dissipative transverse Ising model, as well as an interacting Hatano-Nelson model, on the superconducting quantum processor Wukong. Our work underlines the capability of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices in simulating dissipative many-body dynamics and represents a step forward in exploiting their potential for solving outstanding physical problems.</p>

We characterize this modulation for sideband couplings, at both sweet and offsweet spots, achieving a broad range of coupling strengths as confirmed by both population dynamics and spectroscopy methods. This approach enables phase-controlled modulation of coupling strength, providing a promising candidate for parametrically driven quantum simulations and gate operations.</p>

            <p>Quantum illumination uses quantum entanglement as a resource to enable higher-resolution detection of low-reflectivity targets than is possible with classical techniques. This revolutionary technology could transform modern radar. However, it is widely believed that the decoherence induced by the ubiquitous quantum noise destroys the superiority of quantum illumination, severely constraining its performance and application in our present noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we propose a method to restore the quantum superiority of the quantum illumination in the presence of quantum noises. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov approximation, we discover that the resolution of noisy quantum illumination is highly sensitive to the energy spectrum of the composite system formed by each of the two light modes and its local quantum noise. When a bound state is present in the energy spectrum, the resolution asymptotically approaches its ideal form. Our result establishes a physical principle to preserve the quantum superiority and paves the way for the realization of high-resolution quantum illumination in noisy situations.</p>

            <p>Controlling atom-photon interactions in engineered environments is central to quantum optics and emerging quantum technologies. Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic baths, where dissipation fundamentally reshapes spectral and dynamical properties, provide versatile platforms for such control. Here we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a single two-level quantum emitter coupled to the edge of a semi-infinite dissipative bosonic lattice with uniform loss. Despite the simplicity of this bath, we uncover rich dynamical phase transitions, i.e. qualitative changes in spontaneous emission decay as system parameters are varied. In particular, we establish the existence of an optimal dissipative environment for accelerated spontaneous emission. The phase transitions are traced to spectral restructuring of the resolvent, in some cases governed by the coalescence of resonance states on the second Riemann sheet. We identify these coalescences as virtual exceptional points (EPs) of resonance origin, providing a conceptual bridge with EP physics while highlighting distinctive features of infinite-dimensional NH systems. More broadly, our results illustrate how the specific nature of dissipation -- whether uniform losses, staggered losses, or dephasing -- can profoundly impact emitter relaxation, pointing to dissipation engineering as a versatile tool for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model. We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy, providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>Cavity optomechanics, providing an inherently nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, have shown enomerous potential in generating macroscopic quantum entanglement. Here we propose to realize diverse bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics. By introducing magnons to standard cavity optomechanics, not only tunable optomechanical entanglement and magnon-magnon entanglement can be achieved, but also flexible tripartite entanglement including magnon-photon-phonon entanglement, magnon-magnon-photon and -phonon entanglement can be generated. Moreover, optimal bipartite and tripartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning parameters. We further show that all entanglement can be enhanced via engineering the magnon-photon coupling, and is proven to be robust against the bath temperature within the survival temperature. Besides, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be protected or restored by bad magnons with large decay rate, while other entanglement is severely reduced. The results indicate that our proposal provides a novel avenue to explore and control tunable macroscopic quantum effects in hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanics.</p>

            <p>The ability to establish entanglement between the nodes of future quantum networks is essential for enabling a wide range of new applications in science and technology. A promising approach involves the use of a powerful central node capable of deterministically preparing arbitrary multipartite entangled states of its matter-based qubits and efficiently distributing these states to surrounding end nodes via flying photons. This central node, referred to as a ``factory node", serves as a hub for the production and distribution of multipartite entanglement. In this work, we demonstrate key functionalities of a factory node using a cavity-integrated trapped-ion quantum processor. Specifically, we program the system to generate genuinely multipartite entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of three path-switchable photons and verify them using custom-designed entanglement witnesses. These photons can, in the future, be used to establish stored multipartite entanglement between remote matter-based nodes. Our results demonstrate that the well-established techniques for the deterministic preparation of entangled states of co-trapped ion qubits can be used to prepare the same states of traveling photons, paving the way for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum local area networks.</p>

Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities.

            <p>Intense light-matter interaction largely relies on the use of high-power light sources, creating fields comparable to, or even stronger than, the field keeping the electrons bound in atoms. Under such conditions, the interaction induces highly nonlinear processes such as high harmonic generation, in which the low-frequency photons of a driving laser field are upconverted into higher-frequency photons. These processes have enabled numerous groundbreaking advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and they form the foundation of attosecond science. Until recently, however, such processes were typically described using semi-classical approximations, since the quantum properties of the light field were not required to explain the observables. This has changed in the recent past. Ongoing theoretical and experimental advances show that fully quantized descriptions of intense light-matter interactions, which explicitly incorporate the quantum nature of the light field, open new avenues for both fundamental research and technological applications at the fully quantized level. These advances emerge from the convergence of quantum optics with strong-field physics and ultrafast science. Together, they have given rise to the field of quantum optics and quantum electrodynamics of strong-field processes.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters coupled to traveling photons in waveguides, known as waveguide quantum electrodynamics (WQED), offer a powerful platform for understanding light-matter interactions and underpinning emergent quantum technologies. While WQED has been extensively studied in one dimension, two-dimensional (2D) WQED remains largely unexplored, where novel photonic scattering phenomena unique to higher dimensions are expected. Here, we present a comprehensive scattering theory for 2D WQED based on the Green function method. We show that the mean displacement between emitted and injected photons serves as a quantum analogue of the Goos-HÃ¤nchen shift. When a photon is injected into a single off-centered port, the quantum Goos-HÃ¤nchen (QGH) shift can be enhanced in backward scattering under resonant conditions with subradiant states. When a photon is injected into the center port, there is no QGH shift due to the mirror symmetry of structure. However, for multiple-port injection with transverse momentum, the QGH shift is recovered and proportional to the derivative of phase with respect to transverse momentum. Unlike the classical Goos-HÃ¤nchen shift, these effects can be flexibly tuned by the injected photon's frequency. Our work provides a general framework for exploring and manipulating photonic scattering in complex WQED networks.</p>

            <p>Quantum correlations are interesting resources for modern quantum technologies such as quantum information processing, quantum communication, quantum teleportation, and quantum computation tasks. However, engineering these quantum states turns to be not an easy task. Here, we unveil a theoretical framework for generating and controlling quantum correlations within a double-cavity molecular optomechanical (McOM) system. Our approach leverages strong interactions between confined optical fields and collective molecular vibrations, creating a versatile environment for exploring robust quantum correlations. Our findings reveal that by judiciously optimizing the coupling strength between the cavity field and the molecular collective mode leads to significant enhancement of entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord. We demonstrate that cavity-cavity quantum correlations can be effectively mediated by the molecular collective mode, enabling a unique pathway for inter-cavity quantum connectivity. Moreover, the quantum entanglement generated in our McOM system exhibits robustness against thermal noise, persisting up to temperatures approaching $1000 K$. This strong resilience, qualifies molecular optomechanics as a compelling architecture for scalable, room-temperature quantum information processing and the practical realization of quantum networks. Additionally, the phase-dependent behaviour of quantum discord provides a fundamental basis for developing ultra-sensitive gas sensors, with potential applications in environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and industrial safety.</p>

            <h2>Disorder-Induced Anomalous Diffusion in a 3D Spin Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Stasiuk, Garrett Heller, Lance Berkey, Bo Xing, Paola Cappellaro</p>
            <p>Emergent hydrodynamics (EHD) bridges short-time unitarity with late-time thermodynamics, universal transport phenomena characterize the manner and speed of transport and thermalization. Typical non-integrable systems with few conserved local quantities are expected to be diffusive. In contrast, strongly disordered systems which admit phases such as many-body localization, are predicted to inhibit thermalization and thus slow dynamical transport. Disordered systems represent a uniquely poised platform to probe the quantum-to-classical transition and the emergence of irreversible thermodynamics from the underlying unitary structure. Here, we study a strongly disordered nuclear spin ensemble, using local measurements enabled by the disordered-state technique. We observe an apparent phase transition into a sub-diffusive regime, which we model as a random walk on the emergent fractal structure of a percolating network in the dipolar spin ensemble. Our novel theoretical model provides a framework for characterizing the emergence of thermalization in closed quantum systems, even in the presence of strong disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Giuseppe Catalano, Ceren DaÄ, Gianpaolo Torre, Salvatore Marco Giampaolo, Fabio Franchini</p>
            <p>$W$ states are quantum correlated states possessing both bipartite and multipartite entanglement, which makes them useful for several quantum algorithms. We propose a protocol to generate these states by exploiting {\it topological ring frustration}, and implement it on a programmable Rydberg atom array up to 11 qubits, successfully generating many-body $W$ states of Rubidium atoms. Numerical simulations show promising scaling of the algorithm to tens of qubits with near-term achievable updates on the quantum machines. To validate our state preparation protocol and probe quantum entanglement, we devise a fidelity estimator that requires only two sets of measurements. To implement it, we develop a novel and efficient Bayesian state-tomography approach that takes advantage of accurate classical numerical simulations to overcome limitations in the experimental setup. Hence, a lower bound fidelity of around $77\%$ is certified for the experimentally prepared state of 11 qubits. This work provides a state-of-the-art procedure to generate high-quality quantum entangled $W$ states, demonstrating once more how principles of physics can overcome traditional barriers of computation, and be exploited for quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>While the last few decades have seen a proliferation of experimental demonstrations of entanglement sources, practicality of deployment has been a secondary concern. Recently, the ZALM source was introduced, as a well engineered functional device, easily integrated within a complete networking system. It addresses numerous concerns which make typical academic demonstrations less practical: reliable heralding signals, multiplexing across multiple dimensions, and efficient use of input power. We present a stack of tools for modeling mode by mode a ZALM source under realistic conditions, in isolation, or as a part of a complete network testbed. Our modeling formalism builds upon a hybrid Gaussian and non-Gaussian representation, providing a flexible tradeoff between performance and accuracy, while also greatly simplifying the exact calculation of otherwise expensive scalar figures of merit. This toolkit, implemented in the python package called genqo, is integrated within the QuantumSavory full stack simulator and the QuantumSymbolics computer algebra system. We use this software stack to demonstrate a number of complete networking protocols built upon the ZALM source.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Haidar, Hugo D. Nogueira, J.-Ph. Karr</p>
            <p>We present high-precision quantum computing simulations of three-body atoms (He, H$^-$) and molecules (H$_2^+$, HD$^+$), the latter being studied beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The Non-Iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled Cluster Variational Quantum Eigensolver (NI-DUCC-VQE) [M. Haidar et al., Quantum Sci. Technol. 10, 025031 (2025)] is used. By combining a first-quantized Hamiltonian with a Minimal Complete Pool (MCP) of Lie-algebraic excitations, we construct a compact ansatz with a gradient-independent construction, avoiding costly gradient evaluations and yielding efficient computational scaling with both basis size and electron number. It avoids barren plateaus and enables rapid convergence, achieving energy errors as low as 10$^{-11}$ a.u. with state fidelities only limited by arithmetic precision in only a few thousand function evaluations in all four systems. These results make three-body atoms and molecules excellent candidates for benchmarking and testing on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Further, our approach can be extended to more complex systems with larger basis sets, taking advantage of the efficient scaling of qubit requirements to study electronic correlations and non-adiabatic effects with high precision. We also demonstrate the applicability of NI-DUCC-VQE for simulating higher-order effects such as relativistic corrections and hyperfine interactions.</p>

            <h2>Chiral light from an emitter coupled to an achiral particle via the Purcell effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yining Xuan, Daito Miyazaki, Yuki Ishikawa, Mark Sadgrove</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that non-chiral nanoparticles can produce chiral light when point emitters are coupled to their surface plasmon modes (SPMs) under certain conditions. Chiral emission arises from asymmetrical plasmon mode propagation from the source combined with the spin-momentum locked nature of the SPMs. The Purcell regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) ensures that radiation from the coupled mode dominates over that from the emitter itself, giving rise to photons with a circularly polarized component -- i.e. chiral light. We experimentally demonstrate this effect using electron beam-induced cathode luminescence from a gold nanorod, coupling it evanescently to a nanofiber probe which also supports spin-momentum locked light. This converts the net spin of the emission into a net directionality of propagation in the fiber modes.</p>

            <p>Quantum repeaters are employed in quantum communication to overcome the long-distance transmission loss of quantum states. The quantum repeater is based on various key technologies, including quantum entanglement swapping, quantum memory, and entanglement purification. In particular, quantum purification can distil high-quality entanglement from the degraded entangled states which is propagating through noisy quantum communication channels. Although previous reports have demonstrated on-chip entanglement swapping and teleportation through the less-noisy channel, current entanglement purification experiments still rely on off-chip discrete devices, leading to limitations on scalability, stability, and controllability. In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrated chip-to-chip hyperentanglement distribution and quantum entanglement purification based on integrated silicon chips. Path-encoded high-dimensional entangled photon pairs are produced on the chip, converted to fibre-based polarization-spatial hyperentanglement by grating couplers, distributed to the receiver silicon chip, and finally purified by consuming the spatial degree of freedom. Our purification scheme by integrated photonics finished the last puzzle of on-chip quantum repeater, which will promote the realization of the quantum repeater based on integrated photonics.</p>

            <p>The classical and quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with Lie groups is hindered by the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of gauge degrees of freedom. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. X 15, 031065 (2025)], we introduced a new truncation scheme -- here renamed as Renormalized Dual Basis (RDB) -- based on the resolution of the single-plaquette problem, and demonstrated its performance for SU(2) LGTs. In this paper, we apply the RDB to compact quantum electrodynamics (cQED) in three spacetime dimensions (2+1D). We variationally determine the ground state of the theory for small lattices with periodic (for pure gauge) and open (in presence of fermionic matter) boundary conditions, achieving improved precision for the plaquette operator compared to previous approaches. By leveraging tensor networks, we extend the study to larger lattices and demonstrate the scalability of the method. Overall, we show that the RDB provides an efficient description across all coupling regimes.</p>

Among the various hardware platforms, neutral atom quantum processors based on Rydberg interactions are gaining increasing interest because of their scalability, qubit-connection flexibility, and intrinsic appropriateness for solving combinatorial optimization challenges. This paper provides an overview of the present capabilities, standards, and applications of neutral atom quantum computers. We first discuss recent hardware advancements and register mapping optimization techniques that enhance circuit fidelity and performance. We next review their uses as quantum simulators, in both classical and quantum hard problems, such as MIS and QUBO problems, quantum many-body models and molecules in chemistry and pharmacology.

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a simple yet rich model of strongly interacting electrons with complex dynamics and a variety of emerging quantum phases. These properties make it a compelling target for digital quantum simulation. Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but implementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error mitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping of the FHM to a Z2 LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a subspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection error mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design strategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of NISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In particular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate count of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of simulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on conserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques. Our work demonstrates the value of algorithm-hardware co-design to operate digital quantum simulators at the threshold of maximum circuit depths allowed by current hardware, and is broadly generalizable to strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and materials science.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues using heavy atoms exhibiting strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10' H-spiro\[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately 0.51 Hz/(V/m), comparable to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Magneto-optical trapping of molecules has thus far been restricted to molecules with $^2\Sigma$ electronic ground states. These species are chemically reactive and only support a simple laser cooling scheme from their first excited rotational level. Here, we demonstrate a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of aluminum monofluoride (AlF), a deeply bound and intrinsically stable diatomic molecule with a $^1\Sigma^+$ electronic ground state. The MOT operates on the strong A$^1\Pi\leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition near 227.5~nm, whose Q$(J)$ lines are all rotationally closed. We demonstrate a MOT of about $6\times 10^4$ molecules for the $J=1$ level of AlF, more than $10^4$ molecules for $J=2$ and $3$, and with no fundamental limit in going to higher rotational levels. Laser cooling and trapping of AlF is conceptually similar to the introduction of alkaline-earth atoms into cold atom physics, and is key to leveraging its spin-forbidden a$^3\Pi \leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition for precision spectroscopy and narrow-line cooling.</p>

            <p>The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</p>

            <p>We present two scalable and entanglement-free methods for estimating the collective state of an n-qubit quantum computer. The first method consists of a fixed set of five quantum circuits-regardless of the number of qubits-that avoid the use of entanglement as a measurement resource, relying instead on classical communication between selected pairs of qubits. The second method requires only 2n+1 circuits, each of which applies a single local gate to one of the n qubits during the measurement stage. Unlike traditional estimation methods, our approaches do not require any costly post-processing procedure to estimate a quantum state, enabling scalability to relatively large system sizes. We experimentally compare both methods on freely available IBM quantum processors, and observe how the state estimation varies with increasing number of qubits and shots. We further validated our results by estimating the 4-qubit entangled state of two remote ion-trap quantum processors, demonstrating that the optimized 2n+1 tomographic scheme achieves estimates consistent with standard methods while using exponentially fewer measurements.</p>

            <p>The preparation of data in quantum states is a critical component in the design of quantum algorithms. The cost of this step can significantly limit the realization of quantum advantage in domains such as machine learning, finance, and chemistry. One of the main approaches to achieve efficient state preparation is through the use of Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), a theoretical device for coherent data access with several proposed physical implementations. In this work, we present a framework that integrates the physical model of the Bucket Brigade QRAM (BBQRAM) with the classical data structure of the Segment Tree to achieve efficient state preparation. We introduce a memory layout that embeds a segment tree within BBQRAM memory cells by preserving the segment tree's hierarchy and supporting data retrieval in logarithmic time via specialized access primitives. We demonstrate that, under the proposed memory layout, our method encodes a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$ in a quantum register of $\Theta(\log_2(MN))$ qubits in $O(\log_2^2(MN))$ time using constant ancillary qubits under a fixed-precision assumption. We further illustrate the method through a numerical example. This framework provides theoretical support for quantum algorithms that assume negligible data loading overhead and establishes a foundation for designing classical-to-quantum encoding algorithms that are aware of the underlying physical QRAM architecture.</p>

To explain these results, we derive a non-perturbative master equation to describe the system's dynamics and experimentally confirm our findings in a discrete mesh photonic lattice implemented in a double-fibre ring setup. Surprisingly, our results show that a class of bulk states can be more robust to a certain type of noise than topological edge states.</p>

While such an effective interaction is fundamentally limited to the bosonic nature of photons and the restricted phase responses from commonly used unitary optical elements, loss-induced nonunitary operation provides an alternative degree of freedom to control the quantum interference. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a concise yet powerful tool to unravel fundamental features of quantum interference based on the phase change material vanadium dioxide. Since the insulator-metal transition in an elaborate vanadium dioxide thin film can create any desired particle exchange phase response, we show its tunability over the effective photon-photon interaction between paired photons that are entangled in the symmetric and anti-symmetric forms, which may introduce sophisticated nonunitary operations and functionalities into programmable optical platforms. These results provide an alternative approach to investigate the quantum light-matter interaction, and facilitate the use of quantum interference for various quantum information processing tasks such as quantum simulation and quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum thermometry plays a critical role in the development of low-temperature sensors and quantum information platforms. In this work, we propose and theoretically analyze a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture in which a superconducting qubit is dispersively coupled to two distinct bosonic modes: one initialized in a weak coherent state and the other coupled to a thermal environment. We show that the qubit serves as a sensitive readout of the probe mode, mapping the interference between thermal and coherent photon-number fluctuations onto measurable dephasing. This mechanism enables enhanced sensitivity to sub-millikelvin thermal energy fluctuations through Ramsey interferometry. We derive analytic expressions for the qubit coherence envelope, compute the quantum Fisher information for temperature estimation, and demonstrate numerically that the presence of a coherent reference amplifies the qubit's sensitivity to small changes in thermal photon occupancy. Our results establish a new paradigm for quantum-enhanced thermometry and provide a scalable platform for future calorimetric sensing in high-energy physics and quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regime. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how polariton/bipolariton interaction with the entangled photon pair modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We argue that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity steady state.</p>

            <p>In [Science 340, 1205, 7 June (2013)], via polytopes Michael Walter et al. proposed a sufficient condition detecting the genuinely entangled pure states. In this paper, assume that a state with six non-zero coefficients is not a trivially separable state. Then the state is separable if and only if its six basis states consist of the three partially complementary pairs and the corresponding coefficient matrix has proportional rows. The contrapositive of this result reads that the state is genuinely entangled if and only if its six basis states do not consist of the three partially complementary pairs or though the six basis states consist of the three partially complementary pairs, the corresponding coefficient matrix does not have proportional rows. We propose four corresponding coefficient 2 by 3 matrices and show that if the four coefficient matrices don't have proportional rows, then the state is genuinely entangled. It is trivial to know if two rows of a 2 by 3 coefficient matrix are proportional. The difference from the previous articles is that the structure of the basis states is used to detect entanglement in this paper. One can see that Osterloh and Siewert's states of five and six qubits are genuinely entangled because two rows for any one of the four corresponding coefficient 2 by 3 matrices are not proportional. These states were distinguished as the maximal entangled states by the complicated filters before. Keywords: entanglement, separability, entangled states, separable states, qubits.</p>

            <h2>Cavity QED beyond the Jaynes-Cummings model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abeer Al Ghamdi, Gin Jose, Almut Beige</p>
            <p>As atom-cavity systems are becoming more sophisticated, the limitations of the Jaynes-Cummings model are becoming more apparent. In this paper, we therefore take a more dynamical approach to the modelling of atom-cavity systems and do not reduce the electromagnetic field inside the resonator to a single mode. Our approach shows that the decay rate Gamma_cav of an emitter inside a subwavelength cavity with metallic mirrors can be much larger than its free space decay rate Gamma_free due to constructive interference effects of the emitted light. In general, however, we find that Gamma_cav = Gamma_free to a very good approximation which might explain why many atom-cavity experiments have not been able to operate in the so-called strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is essential for interfacing quantum systems operating at different wavelengths and for realizing scalable quantum networks. Despite extensive progress, achieving QFC with simultaneous high efficiency, low pump power, minimal added noise, broad bandwidth, and pump-wavelength flexibility remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient, low-noise, and bidirectional QFC between the telecom (1550-nm) and visible (780-nm) bands using unpoled indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) $\chi^{(2)}$ nanophotonic waveguides, eliminating the need for a long-wavelength pump. Leveraging the large nonlinear susceptibility of InGaP together with programmable modal-phase-matching control, we obtain record-low pump power (20 mW) -- an order of magnitude lower than that in previous demonstrations using integrated thin-film waveguides -- with record-high loss-inclusive normalized conversion efficiency among non-resonant QFC implementations. With added noise well below the single-photon level, our platform preserves the quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons. These results mark a significant advance in integrated nonlinear photonics for high-performance QFC, facilitating the development of versatile and scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Symmetric Reduction Techniques for Quantum Graph Colouring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lord Sen, Shyamapada Mukherjee</p>
            <p>This paper introduces an efficient quantum computing method for reducing special graphs in the context of the graph coloring problem. The special graphs considered include both symmetric and non-symmetric graphs where the axis passes through nodes only, edges only, and both together. The presented method reduces the number of coloring matrices, which is important for realization of the number of quantum states required, from $K^{N}$ to $K^{\frac{N+m}{2}}$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes, where $K$ is the number of colours required and \emph{N} being total number of nodes. Similarly for other types also, the number of quantum states is reduced. The complexity in the number of qubits has been reduced by $\delta C_q= \frac{9N^2}{8}-\frac{3m^2}{8}-\frac{3Nm}{4}-\frac{N}{4}+\frac{m}{4}$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs, symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes and other types as presented in the paper. Additionally, the number of gates and number of iterations are reduced massively compared to state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Like for a graph with 20 nodes and symmetric line passing through 2 nodes, the number of iterations decreased from 5157 to 67. Therefore, the procedure presented for solving the graph coloring problem now requires a significantly reduced number of qubits compared to before. The run time of the proposed algorithm for these special type of graphs are reduced from $O(1.9575^{N})$ to $O(1.9575^{(\frac{N+m}{2})})$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes and similarly for others cases.</p>

            <p>Quantum circuit synthesis and compilation are critical components in the quantum computing stack, both for contemporary quantum systems, where efficient use of limited resources is essential, as well as for large-scale fault-tolerant platforms, where computation time can be minimized.

We present a phase-gadget based method for compilation of quantum circuits using programmable multiqubit entangling gates, that are native, among others, to trapped-ions quantum computers. We use phase-gadgets in order to generically reduce circuit depths and efficiently implement them with few, high-fidelity, multiqubit gates. We test our methods on a large set of benchmark circuits and demonstrate generic circuit depth reduction and implementation error reduction.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid CramÃ©r-Rao bound for Quantum Bayes-Point Estimation with Nuisance Parameters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianchao Zhang, Jun Suzuki</p>
            <p>We develop a hybrid framework for quantum parameter estimation in the presence of nuisance parameters. In this Bayes-point scheme, the parameters of interest are treated as fixed non-random parameters while nuisance parameters are integrated out with respect to a prior (random parameters). Within this setting, we introduce the hybrid partial quantum Fisher information matrix (hpQFIM), defined by prior-averaging the nuisance block of the QFIM and taking a Schur complement, and derive a corresponding CramÃ©r-Rao-type lower bound on the hybrid risk. We establish structural properties of the hpQFIM, including inequalities that bracket it between computationally tractable surrogates, as well as limiting behaviors under extreme priors. Operationally, the hybrid approach improves over pure point estimation since the optimal measurement for the parameters of interest depends only on the prior distribution of the nuisance, rather than on its unknown value. We illustrate the framework with analytically solvable qubit models and numerical examples, clarifying how partial prior information on nuisance variables can be systematically exploited in quantum metrology.</p>

Exploiting the single-site and cluster mean-field approximations, we show the bistability of the absorbing and active phases in the system with strong interaction between neighboring sites, accompanied by the closing of the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover we find that, near the transition point, the system may evolve first to the long-lived metastable state before reaching the eventual steady state, suggesting us to prolong the time-evolution in the numerical simulation to find the true steady state. We also present the extrapolated transition point by systematically including the correlations in the system.</p>

Among the approaches to address these issues, efficient-BB84 has shown durable and reliable performances, while optical switching techniques enable flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient integration of QKD into existing infrastructures. In this work, we present an active QKD network in a production environment, employing efficient-BB84 and optical switching, orchestrated in a coordinated manner, emphasizing their potential to support robust, future-proof quantum-secure communication systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Jose Lozano Palacio, Hasan Nayfeh, Matthew Ware, David C. McKay</p>
            <p>With the continued scaling of quantum processors, holistic benchmarks are essential for extensively evaluating device performance. Layer fidelity is a benchmark well-suited to assessing processor performance at scale. Key advantages of this benchmark include its natural alignment with randomized benchmarking (RB) procedures, crosstalk awareness, fast measurements over large numbers of qubits, high signal-to-noise ratio, and fine-grained information. In this work, we extend the analysis of the original layer fidelity manuscript to optimize parameters of the benchmark and extract deeper insights of its application. We present a robust protocol for identifying optimal qubit chains of length N, demonstrating that our method yields error per layered gate (EPLG) values 40%-70% lower than randomly selected chains. We further establish layer fidelity as an effective performance monitoring tool, capturing both edge-localized and device-wide degradation by tracking optimal chains of length 50 and 100, and fixed chains of length 100. Additionally, we refine error analysis by proposing parameter bounds on the number of randomizations and Clifford lengths used in direct RB fits, minimizing fit uncertainties. Finally, we analyze the impact of varying gate durations on layer fidelity measurements, showing that prolonged gate times leading to idling times significantly increase layered two-qubit (2Q) errors on Eagle R3 processors. Notably, we observe a 95% EPLG increase on a fixed chain in an Eagle R3 processor when some gate durations are extended by 65%. These findings extend the applicability of the layer fidelity benchmark and provide practical guidelines for optimizing quantum processor evaluations.</p>

            <h2>Single-letter Chain Rule for Quantum Relative Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulio Gasbarri, Matt Hoogsteder-Riera</p>
            <p>Relative entropy is the standard measure of distinguishability in classical and quantum information theory. In the classical case, its loss under channels admits an exact chain rule, while in the quantum case only asymptotic, regularized chain rules are known. We establish new chain rules for quantum relative entropy that apply already in the single-copy regime. The first inequality is obtained via POVM decompositions, extending the point distributions in the classical chain rule to quantum ensemble partitions. The second gives a sufficient condition for the most natural extension of the classical result, which uses projectors as a analog for the classical point distributions. We additionally find a semiclassical chain rule where the point distributions are replaced with the projectors of the initial states, and, finally, we find a relation to previous works on strengthened data processing inequalities and recoverability. These results show that meaningful chain inequalities are possible already at the single-copy level, but they also highlight that tighter bounds remain to be found.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nhat A. Nghiem, Trung V. Phan</p>
            <p>We explore the physical quantum properties of atoms in fractal spaces, both as a theoretical generalization of normal integer-dimensional Euclidean spaces and as an experimentally realizable setting. We identify the threshold of fractality at which Ehrenfest atomic instability emerges, where the SchrÃ¶dinger equation describing the wave-function of a single electron orbiting around an atom becomes scale-free, and discuss the potential of observing this phenomena in laboratory settings. We then study the Rydberg states of stable atoms using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation, along with a proposed extension for the Langer modification, in general fractal dimensionalities. We show that fractal space atoms near instability explode in size even at low-number excited state, making them highly suitable to induce strong entanglements and foster long-range many-body interactions. We argue that atomic physics in fractal spaces -- ``fractatomic physics'' -- is a rich research avenue deserving of further theoretical and experimental investigations.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence is a key resource underpinning quantum technologies, yet it is highly susceptible to environmental decoherence, especially in thermal settings. While frequency modulation (FM) has shown promise in preserving coherence at zero temperature, its effectiveness in realistic, noisy thermal environments remains unclear. In this work, we investigate a single frequency-modulated qubit interacting with a thermal phase-covariant reservoir composed of dissipative and dephasing channels. We demonstrate that FM significantly preserves coherence in the presence of thermal dissipation while being ineffective under thermal pure-dephasing noise due to commutation between system and interaction Hamiltonians. When both noise channels are present, FM offers protection only for weak dephasing coupling. Our findings clarify the limitations and potential of FM-based coherence protection under thermal noise, supplying practical insights into designing robust quantum systems for quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Certifying nonclassical correlations typically requires access to all subsystems, presenting a major challenge in open quantum systems coupled to inaccessible environments. Recent works have shown that, in autonomous pure dephasing scenarios, quantum discord with the environment can be certified from system-only dynamics via the Hamiltonian ensemble formulation. However, this approach leaves open whether stronger correlations, such as entanglement, can be certified. Moreover, its reliance on Fourier analysis requires full-time dynamics, which is experimentally resource-intensive and provides limited information about when such correlations are established during evolution. In this work, we present a method that enables the certification of system-environment quantum entanglement solely from the reduced dynamics of the system. The method is based on the theory of mixed-unitary channels and applies to general non-autonomous pure dephasing scenarios. Crucially, it relaxes the need for full-time dynamics, offering a resource-efficient approach that also reveals the precise timing of entanglement generation. We experimentally validate this method on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum processor with a controlled-dephasing model. Finally, we highlight its potential as a tool for certifying gravitationally induced entanglement.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely used in the development of a number of sensors. The sensitivity of these devices is limited by both the number of centers used and their coherent properties. While the effects on the coherent properties of paramagnetic impurities such as carbon 13-isotopes and p1 centers are rather well understood, the mutual interaction of NV centers, which becomes especially important in relatively dense NV ensembles, is less well understood. Here, we provide a systematic study of NV-NV interaction using a dynamical double electron-electron resonance sequence, making it possible to directly observe the interaction of NV centers. Two types of dynamical DEER sequences were considered, consisting of 3 and 4 pulses. The nature of the phase jump in the 3-pulse sequence was attributed to the effect of non-commuting rotations within the sequence. Both the phase of the state vector rotation and its amplitude decay were studied, thus presenting a complete picture of decoherence due to NV-NV interaction. It was shown that the rate of the state vector decay differed significantly from predictions for a spin 1/2 system. However, the decay rate observed in the DEER sequence remained a reliable indicator of the concentration of bath spins and could be used to measure NV center concentration, provided that the magnetic transition of NV centers is saturated.</p>

Here we report the demonstration of a quantum-network node with a simple cavity-free cold atomic ensemble. This node gives an initial retrieval efficiency of approximately 50\% and memory lifetime of 160 $\mu$s for atomic qubits. With the aid of a high-efficiency and polarization-independent quantum frequency conversion (QFC) module, the generated entangled photon in the node at 780-nm wavelength is converted to telecom S band at 1522 nm, enabling atom-photon distribution over long distance. We observe an entanglement fidelity between the atoms and telecom photon exceeding 80\% after photon transmission over 20-km fiber, the remaining infidelity being dominated by atomic decoherence. The low-noise QFC with an external efficiency up to 48.5\% gives a signal-to-noise-ratio of 6.9 for transmitted photons with fiber length up to 100 km, laying the cornerstone for entanglement distribution at a hundred-km level.

            <p>The hybrid interferometer integrating an optical parametric amplifier and a beam splitter has the potential to outperform the SU(1,1) interferometer. However, photon loss remains a critical limitation for practical implementation. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum metrology scheme utilizing multi-photon subtraction at the output and replacing the conventional 50:50 beam splitter with a variable beam splitter to enhance robustness against photon loss. We employ a coherent state and a vacuum state as inputs and perform homodyne detection. Our results show that the selection of input modes significantly affects phase estimation, and optimizing the beam splitter's transmittance is crucial for maximizing phase sensitivity in lossy conditions. Furthermore, photon subtraction markedly improves phase sensitivity, quantum Fisher information, and robustness against noise. Our scheme achieves sensitivities beyond the Heisenberg limit even under 20% photon loss.</p>

We observed that asymmetry in the quadrature measurements of the shot noise-limited heterodyne detector affects the accuracy of the reference signal's phase estimation and thereby reduces the achievable transmission distance and key rate of the CV-QKD system. We quantify the effect and propose a method to counteract the effect of detection asymmetry. We also evaluate the effects of detection asymmetry using quantum optical tomography.</p>

            <p>Light-matter coupled Hamiltonians are central to cavity materials engineering and polaritonic chemistry, but are challenging to simulate with classical hardware due to the scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of quantum photon modes and matter complexity. Leveraging the fact that quantum computers naturally represent photonic modes efficiently, we present a novel approach to simulate quantum-electrodynamical (QED) systems on near-term quantum hardware. After developing the bosonic and mixed operators in the Qiskit Nature framework, we employ them to simulate a first-order Trotterized Hamiltonian for a spontaneous-emission problem of a two-level system in an optical cavity. We find that using a standing-waves photonic basis approach leads to fidelity issues due to hardware connectivity constraints and two-qubits gates errors. Hence, we propose using a localized photonic basis approach that enforces nearest-neighbor couplings, thanks to which we can map the Hamiltonian as a 1D qubit chain. We significantly reduce the noise and, by applying the zero-noise extrapolation error mitigation technique, we recover the accurate quantum dynamics. Finally, we also show that this approach is resilient when relaxing the 1D qubit chain approximation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.J.Luo</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an intrinsic or background-independent quantum framework based on entangled state rather than absolute quantum state, it describes a quantum relative state between the under-study quantum system and the quantum measuring apparatus as a quantum reference system, without relying on any external absolute parameter. The paper focuses on a simple example, in which a quantum object's one-dimensional position as an under-study quantum system, and a quantum clock as a quantum reference system or quantum measuring apparatus. The evolution equation of the state of the quantum object's position with respect to the state of the quantum clock is given, which is found to be a complex Gauss-Codazzi type equation of the total quantum state space coming from the Ricci-flat Kahler-Einstein equation. In a linear and non-relativistic approximation, the framework recovers the equation of the standard quantum mechanics, in which an intrinsic potential related to some "inertial force" is automatically incorporated in the covariant derivative. A physical relative probability interpretation and a geometric non-trivial fiber bundle interpretation of the entangled state in this intrinsic quantum framework are given. Furthermore, some non-inertial effects, such as the "inertial force", coming from the general covariance of the intrinsic quantum framework are also discussed. Compared with the functional integral approach which is more easily to generalize the quantum clock to the quantum spacetime reference frame and study quantum gravity, the relative state approach as a canonical description is more suitable for conceptually demonstrating the connections to the standard formalism and interpretation of the quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic quantum amplifiers maintain coherence even while strongly coupled to their surroundings, demonstrating that coherence can be preserved through architecture rather than isolation. Here we derive a finite structured-bath Hamiltonian in which dissipation and feedback originate from the same microscopic couplings. The resulting self-energy {\Sigma}({\omega}) exhibits coupled real and imaginary parts whose evolution reproduces the breathing dynamics observed in Josephson quantum amplifiers. This establishes quantum reciprocity: macroscopic coherence lives not in isolation, but in structured connection. We numerically validate this principle by engineering a six-qubit structured bath to demonstrate controllable transitions from dissipation to amplification. This architectural core serves as the foundation for a proposed multi-scale workflow to transform quantum noise into a design resource, preserving coherence not through isolation but through architectural reciprocity.</p>

            <p>Federated learning (FL) focuses on collaborative model training without the need to move the private data silos to a central server. Despite its several benefits, the classical FL is plagued with several limitations, such as high computational power required for model training(which is critical for low-resource clients), privacy risks, large update traffic, and non-IID heterogeneity. This chapter surveys a hybrid paradigm - Quantum Federated Learning (QFL), which introduces quantum computation, that addresses multiple challenges of classical FL and offers rapid computing capability while keeping the classical orchestration intact. Firstly, we motivate QFL with a concrete presentation on pain points of classical FL, followed by a discussion on a general architecture of QFL frameworks specifying the roles of client and server, communication primitives and the quantum model placement. We classify the existing QFL systems based on four criteria - quantum architecture (pure QFL, hybrid QFL), data processing method (quantum data encoding, quantum feature mapping, and quantum feature selection & dimensionality reduction), network topology (centralized, hierarchial, decentralized), and quantum security mechanisms (quantum key distribution, quantum homomorphic encryption, quantum differential privacy, blind quantum computing). We then describe applications of QFL in healthcare, vehicular networks, wireless networks, and network security, clearly highlighting where QFL improves communication efficiency, security, and performance compared to classical FL. We close with multiple challenges and future works in QFL, including extension of QFL beyond classification tasks, adversarial attacks, realistic hardware deployment, quantum communication protocols deployment, aggregation of different quantum models, and quantum split learning as an alternative to QFL.</p>

We formulate a mixed-integer optimization model that yields optimal solutions with relatively low execution time for small code distances, and propose a scalable heuristic that matches optimal results while maintaining linear computational complexity. We evaluate the synthesized architecture using architectural metrics, such as shuttling distance and cycle time, and full quantum simulations under realistic noise models, showing that the proposed design can sustain logical error rates as low as $2\cdot 10^{-10}$ per round at code distance 21, showcasing its feasibility for scalable quantum error correction in spin-based quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Fiber-to-chip couplers play a crucial role in interfacing on-chip photonic circuits with other optical systems or off-chip devices. Downsizing the couplers via topology optimization addresses the demand for high-density integration and improves the scalability of photonic integrated systems. However, these optimized couplers have yet to reach the performance level demonstrated by their conventional counterparts, leaving room for further improvement. In this work, we apply topology optimization to design single-polarization 1D and dual-polarization 2D grating couplers incorporating bottom reflectors and achieve sub-decibel coupling efficiency. Both types of couplers are fabricated on the silicon-on-insulator platform with dimensions of mere 14 $\mu$m $\times$ 14 $\mu$m and are compatible with standard single-mode fibers at normal incidence. From our experimental characterization, the measured peak coupling efficiency of the topology-optimized 1D and 2D couplers is -0.92(1) dB and -0.86(13) dB, respectively, within the telecom C-band.

            <h2>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for MIMO with Quantized b-bit Beamforming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikos A Mitsiou, Ioannis Krikidis, George K Karagiannidis</p>
            <p>Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for 6G communication, offering improved spectral efficiency and reliability. However, conventional fully digital designs face significant challenges due to high hardware complexity and power consumption. Low-bit MIMO architectures, such as those employing b-bit quantized phase shifters, provide a cost-effective alternative but introduce NP-hard combinatorial problems in the pre- and post-coding design. This paper explores the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and alternating optimization to address the problem of b-bit quantized phase shifters both at the transmitter and the receiver. We demonstrate that the structure of this quantized beamforming problem aligns naturally with hybrid-classical methods like QAOA, as the phase shifts used in beamforming can be directly mapped to rotation gates in a quantum circuit. Notably, this paper is the first to show that theoretical connection. Then, the Hamiltonian derivation analysis for the b-bit case is presented, which could have applications in different fields, such as integrated sensing and communication, and emerging quantum algorithms such as quantum machine learning. In addition, a warm-start QAOA approach is studied which improves computational efficiency. Numerical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving an improved quantized beamforming gain over their classical optimization benchmarks from the literature.</p>

            <h2>Unravelling inter-channel quantum interference in below-threshold nonsequential double ionization with statistical measures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Hashim, C. Figueira de Morisson Faria</p>
            <p>We present a systematic study of interchannel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) within the strong-field approximation. Focusing on the below-threshold intensity regime where the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) pathway dominates, we derive analytical phase conditions governing interference between distinct excitation channels for arbitrary driving fields. To quantify the interplay between channels resulting from a vast number of interfering processes, we introduce statistical metrics based on the Earth Mover's Distance, allowing us to assess the relative weight of each channel's contribution to the two-electron photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs). We identify key factors that determine whether interchannel interference is appreciable such as comparable channel intensities, strong spatial overlap between the excited-state wavefunctions and the energy difference between contributing channels. We demonstrate that for linearly polarized few-cycle pulses, the typical intrachannel interference features associated with exchange, temporal shifts and combined exchange-temporal interference are retained with interchannel interference. Our findings establish a hierarchy of interference mechanisms in RESI and may provide practical guidelines for enhancing or suppressing interference in different regions of the momentum plane.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mawgan A. Smith, Ryan D. McKenzie, Alban Joseph, Robert L. Stamps, Rair MacÃªdo</p>
            <p>Driven-dissipative systems provide a natural setting for the emergence of exceptional points -- i.e. non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenmodes coalesce. These points are important for applications such as sensing, where enhanced sensitivity is required, and exhibit interesting and useful phenomena that can be controlled with experimentally accessible parameters. In this regard a four-port, three-mode, cavity-magnonics platform is demonstrated in which two microwave excitations can be precisely phase shifted and/or attenuated relative to one another. Destructive interference between the hybridised cavity-magnon modes is shown to give rise to antimodes (antiresonances) in the transmission spectrum, enabling coherent perfect extinction of the outgoing signals at selected ports. This interference can be used to actively tune the position and properties of exceptional points, without the fine tuning conventionally required to obtain exceptional points. Such controllable, interference-based engineering of exceptional points provides a practical and flexible pathway toward next-generation, high-sensitivity sensing devices operating at microwave frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Emergent nonlocal interactions induced by quantized gauge fields in topological systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adel Ali, Alexey Belyanin</p>
            <p>We study fermionic and bosonic systems coupled to a real or synthetic static gauge field that is quantized, so the field itself is a quantum degree of freedom and can exist in coherent superposition. A natural example is electrons on a quantum ring encircling a quantized magnetic flux (QMF) generated by a superconducting current. We show that coupling to a common QMF gives rise to an emergent interaction between particles with no classical analog, as it is topological and nonlocal (independent of interparticle distance). Moreover, the interaction persists even when the particles lie in a nominally field-free region, with the vector potential mediating the interaction. We analyze several one- and two-dimensional model systems, encompassing both real and synthetic gauge fields. These systems exhibit unusual behavior, including strong nonlinearities, non-integer Chern numbers, and quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, synthetic gauge fields offer high tunability and can reach field strengths that are difficult to realize with real magnetic fields, enabling engineered nonlinearities and interaction profiles.</p>

            <h2>Marginal Influence of Anomalous Josephson Current on Odd-Frequency Spin-Triplet Pairing in Ferromagnetic Josephson Diodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhajit Pal, Colin Benjamin</p>
            <p>We examine how an anomalous Josephson current influences odd-frequency superconducting correlations in two distinct Josephson junction geometries. The first configuration consists of two ferromagnetic layers sandwiched between conventional s-wave superconductors, with the magnetization vectors of the ferromagnets misaligned. The second involves three ferromagnetic layers embedded between two s-wave superconductors, with their magnetizations oriented along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. In the first case, where the anomalous Josephson current is absent, odd-frequency spin-triplet correlations develop pronounced peaks at finite magnetization strengths in both the tunneling and transparent limits, while the equal-spin triplet component exhibits zeros at finite magnetizations in the transparent regime. In the second configuration, where an anomalous Josephson current is present, similar peaks in odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing appear at finite magnetizations under both transport regimes, and the spatial profile of these correlations remains largely unaffected by the current\rq{}s presence. The Josephson diode efficiency is finite and attains its maximum at magnetization values corresponding to the peaks of the anomalous current. Overall, our results demonstrate that the anomalous Josephson current has only a marginal effect on odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, suggesting that the emergence of odd-frequency correlations and the Josephson diode effect are largely independent phenomena, contrary to some earlier conjectures.</p>

            <h2>Correlation of divergency: c-delta. Being different in a similar way or not</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan F. Hoorn</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the correlation-of-divergency coefficient, c-delta, a custom statistical measure designed to quantify the similarity of internal divergence patterns between two groups of values. Unlike conventional correlation coefficients such as Pearson or Spearman, which assess the association between paired values, c-delta evaluates whether the way values differ within one group is mirrored in another. The method involves calculating, for each value, its divergence from all other values in its group, and then comparing these patterns across the two groups (e.g., human vs machine intelligence). The coefficient is normalised by the average root mean square divergence within each group, ensuring scale invariance. Potential applications of c-delta span quantum physics, where it can compare the spread of measurement outcomes between quantum systems, as well as fields such as genetics, ecology, psychometrics, manufacturing, machine learning, and social network analysis. The measure is particularly useful for benchmarking, clustering validation, and assessing the similarity of variability structures. While c-delta is not bounded between -1 and 1 and may be sensitive to outliers (but so is PMCC), it offers a new perspective for analysing internal variability and divergence. The article discusses the mathematical formulation, potential adaptations for complex data, and the interpretative considerations relevant to this alternative approach.</p>

We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories.

Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</p>

            <p>Theoretical research has been conducted to study how geometry affects charge and spin transport in $\beta\mathrm{12}$ borophene quantum dots, which are confined systems. The study examined two distinct central regions, which included a circular disc and a regular hexagonal area that connected to semi-infinite zigzag and armchair borophene nanoribbon leads. The system was described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration: armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts. Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and $\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based nanoscale spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>On the Capacity of Erasure-prone Quantum Storage with Erasure-prone Entanglement Assistance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Sun, Syed A. Jafar</p>
            <p>A quantum message is encoded into $N$ storage nodes (quantum systems $Q_1\dots Q_N$) with assistance from $N_B$ maximally entangled bi-partite quantum systems $A_1B_1, \dots, A_{N_B}B_{N_B}$, that are prepared in advance such that $B_1\dots B_{N_B}$ are stored separately as entanglement assistance (EA) nodes, while $A_1\dots A_{N_B}$ are made available to the encoder. Both the storage nodes and EA nodes are erasure-prone. The quantum message must be recoverable given any $K$ of the $N$ storage nodes along with any $K_B$ of the $N_B$ EA nodes. The capacity for this setting is the maximum size of the quantum message, given that the size of each EA node is $\lambda_B$. All node sizes are relative to the size of a storage node, which is normalized to unity. The exact capacity is characterized as a function of $N,K,N_B,K_B, \lambda_B$ in all cases, with one exception. The capacity remains open for an intermediate range of $\lambda_B$ values when a strict majority of the $N$ storage nodes, and a strict non-zero minority of the $N_B$ EA nodes, are erased. As a key stepping stone, an analogous classical storage (with shared-randomness assistance) problem is introduced. A set of constraints is identified for the classical problem, such that classical linear code constructions translate to quantum storage codes, and the converse bounds for the two settings utilize similar insights. In particular, the capacity characterizations for the classical and quantum settings are shown to be identical in all cases where the capacity is settled.</p>

            <p>Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was also adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL consists of a 2-step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit into the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum Circuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with $R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of $ZZ(\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of gates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a family of approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquid problems. These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly outperform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code and PXP Rydberg Hamiltonian models, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures.</p>

            <p>The performance of error correction in the surface code can be enhanced by leveraging the knowledge of the noise model for physical qubits. To provide accurate noise information to the decoder in parallel with quantum computation, an adaptive estimation of the noise model based on syndrome measurement statistics is an effective approach. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-established for Pauli noise, it remains unexplored for more complex and realistic scenarios such as amplitude damping which cannot be represented as a Pauli channel. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference methods for general noise models, integrating a tensor network simulator of surface code, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic scenario, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present numerical results of applying our proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and nonuniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.</p>

            <p>Quantum uncertainty relations impose fundamental limits on the joint knowledge that can be acquired from complementary observables: perfect knowledge of a quantum state in one basis implies maximal indetermination in all other mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Uncertainty relations derived from joint properties of the MUBs are generally assumed to be uniform, irrespective of the specific observables chosen within a set. In this work, we demonstrate instead that the uncertainty relations can depend on the choice of observables. Through both experimental observation and numerical methods, we show that selecting different sets of three MUBs in a 5-dimensional quantum system results in distinct uncertainty bounds, i.e. in varying degrees of complementarity, in terms of both entropy and variance.</p>

            <p>The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum--classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hai-Long Shi, Augusto Smerzi, Luca PezzÃ¨</p>
            <p>Multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for advancing quantum technologies, with considerable research efforts directed toward achieving its rapid and scalable generation. In this work, we derive an analytical expression for the time-averaged quantum Fisher information (QFI), enabling the detection of scalable multipartite entanglement dynamically generated by all quantum chaotic systems governed by Dyson's ensembles. Our approach integrates concepts of randomness and quantum chaos, demonstrating that the QFI is universally determined by the structure and dimension of the Krylov space that confines the chaotic dynamics. In particular, the QFI ranges from $N^2/3$ for $N$ qubits in the permutation-symmetric subspace (e.g. for chaotic kicked top models with long-range interactions), to $N$ when the dynamics extend over the full Hilbert space with or without bit reversal symmetry or parity symmetry (e.g. in chaotic models with short-range Ising-like interactions). In the former case, the QFI reveals multipartite entanglement among $N/3$ qubits and highlights the power of chaotic collective spin systems in generating scalable multipartite entanglement. Interestingly this result can be related to isotropic substructures in the Wigner distribution of chaotic states and demonstrates the efficacy of quantum chaos for Heisenberg-scaling quantum metrology. Finally, our general expression for the QFI agrees with that obtained for random states and, differently from out-of-time-order-correlators, it can also distinguish chaotic from integrable unstable spin dynamics.</p>

            <p>The most important characteristic of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol is its security against third-party attacks, and the potential countermeasures available. While new types of attacks are regularly developed in the literature, they rarely involve the use of weak continuous measurement and more specifically machine learning to infer the qubit states. In this paper, we design a new individual attack scheme called \textit{Deep-learning-based continuous attack} (DLCA) that exploits continuous measurement together with the powerful pattern recognition capacities of deep recurrent neural networks. As a minimal model, we present its performances when applied in the case of the BB84 protocol with intrinsic noise in the communication channel. Our results suggest that our attack's performances lie between the ones of standard intercept-and-resend attacks and of the optimal individual attack, namely the phase-covariant quantum cloner. Our attack scheme demonstrates deep-learning-enhanced quantum state tomography applied to QKD, and could be generalized in many different ways, notably in the cases of quantum hacking attacks targeting implementation vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of QKD protocols.</p>

            <p>Topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films exhibit unique electronic properties arising from their topologically protected surface states. In a theoretical model capturing the essential physics of Dirac electrons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. By using experimental Fermi velocities of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, our results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</p>

            <p>Error filtration is a hardware scheme that mitigates noise by exploiting auxiliary qubits and entangling gates. Although both signal and ancillas are subject to local noise, constructive interference(and in some cases post-selection) allows us to reduce the noise level in the signal qubit. Here we determine the optimal entangling unitary gates that make the qubits interfere most effectively,starting from a set of universal gates and proceeding by optimizing suitable functionals by gradient-descent or stochastic approximation. We examine how our optimized scheme behaves under imperfect implementation, where ancillary qubits may be noisy or subject to cross-talk. Even with these imperfections, we find that adding more ancillary qubits helps in protecting quantum this http URL benchmark our approach against figures of merit that correspond to different applications, including entanglement fidelity, quantum Fisher information (for applications in quantum sensing),and CHSH value (for cryptographic applications), with one, two, and three ancillary qubits. With one and two ancillas we also provide analytical explicit expressions from an ansatz for the optimal unitary. We also compare our method with the recently introduced Superposed Quantum Error Mitigation (SQEM) scheme based on superposition of causal orders, and show that, for a wide range of noise strengths, our approach may outperform SQEM in terms of effectiveness and robustness.</p>

            <p>Quantum control plays a crucial role in enhancing precision scaling for quantum sensing. However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with time domain imperfections, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chellasamy Jebarathinam, Huan-Yu Ku, Hao-Chung Cheng, Hsi-Sheng Goan</p>
            <p>This work addresses which aspect of \textit{bipartite coherence} in \textit{quantum discord} is essential for \textit{genuinely quantum correlation}. To this end, \textit{global coherence} of bipartite states is defined as a form of bipartite coherence that is not local coherence in either of the subsystems or in both subsystems alone, and we identify it as being indicated by a witness of discord. With \textit{global coherence} as \textit{a resource}, \textit{any local operations} of the form $\Phi_A \otimes \Phi_B$, which may create coherence locally, are \textit{free operations}. This implies that with global coherence as a resource for operational tasks, any local operations can be freely used, but require \textit{classical randomness not to be freely} available. Using this identification, we demonstrate that \textit{global coherence} is a \textit{necessary resource} for the task of \textit{semi-device-independent steerability} of quantum discord. On the other hand, for the task of \textit{remote state preparation} using \textit{quantum discord} in two-qubit states, a \textit{necessary and sufficient quantum resource} is identified by invoking a \textit{witness of global coherence}.</p>

            <h2>Microscale Sensing with Strongly Interacting NV Ensembles at High Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ainitze Biteri-Uribarren, Ana Martin, Jorge Casanova</p>
            <p>Advances in sensing devices that utilize nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles in diamond are driving progress in microscale nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Utilizing quantum sensing techniques in the high-field regime significantly boosts sensitivity by increasing thermal polarization and improves spectral quality via enhanced energy shifts. Compatible with the latter, a straightforward manner to further raise sensor sensitivity is to increase NV concentration, although this intensifies detrimental dipole-dipole interactions among NVs. In this Letter, we present a method for detecting NMR signals in high-field scenarios while effectively suppressing dipole-dipole couplings in the NV ensemble. Thus, this approach enhances sensitivity by combining highly doped diamond substrates and elevated magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>Quantum states that remain separable (i.e., not entangled) under any global unitary transformation are known as absolutely separable and form a convex set. Despite extensive efforts, the complete characterization of this set remains largely unknown. In this work, we employ linear maps and their inverses to derive new sufficient analytical conditions for absolute separability in arbitrary dimensions, providing extremal points of this set and improving its characterization. Additionally, we employ convex geometry optimization to refine the characterization of the set when multiple non-comparable criteria for absolute separability are available. We also address the closely related problem of characterizing the absolute PPT (positive partial transposition) set, which consists of quantum states that remain positive under partial transposition across all unitary transformations. Finally, we extend our results to multipartite states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan de Boer, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Erik Tonni</p>
            <p>In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</p>

            <h2>Using quantum nonlocality for device-independent confirmation of relativistic effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubhayan Sarkar</p>
            <p>Synchronizing clocks to measure time is a fundamental process underpinning every practical communication task from GPS to parallel computation. However, as the current protocols are based on classical communication between the sender and receiver, they are prone to simple attacks that could cause a slight delay in the signal which would then cause a massive error in further operations. In this work, we first explain a simple attack that in principle can cause an arbitrary delay in the signal between sender and receiver. We then propose a way to overcome this problem by using a recently contrived idea of device-independent certification which utilises quantum nonlocality. Consequently, clocks can be synchronized in a highly secure way without trusting any devices in the setup. We then extend this proposal to observe relativistic time dilation in a device-independent manner.</p>

            <p>We characterize the dynamical state of many-body bosonic and fermionic many-body models with inter-site Gaussian couplings, on-site non-Gaussian interactions and local dissipation comprising incoherent particle loss, particle gain, and dephasing. We first establish that, for fermionic systems, if the dephasing noise is larger than the non-Gaussian interactions, irrespective of the Gaussian coupling strength, the system state is a convex combination of Gaussian states at all times. Furthermore, for bosonic systems, we show that if the particle loss and particle gain rates are larger than the Gaussian inter-site couplings, the system remains in a separable state at all times. Building on this characterization, we establish that at noise rates above a threshold, there exists a classical algorithm that can efficiently sample from the system state of both the fermionic and bosonic models. Finally, we show that, unlike fermionic systems, bosonic systems can evolve into states that are not convex-Gaussian even when the dissipation is much higher than the on-site non-Gaussianity. Similarly, unlike bosonic systems, fermionic systems can generate entanglement even with noise rates much larger than the inter-site couplings.</p>

Unlike previous approaches, our formulation applies universally to both bosonic and fermionic setups, and remains valid even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, allowing for the exact computation of the system's reduced density matrix across all parameter regimes. Remarkably, the GME shares the same operatorial structure as the Redfield equation and depends on a single kernel - a dressed environment correlation function accounting for all virtual interactions between the system and the environment. This simple structure grants a clear physical interpretation and makes the GME easy to simulate numerically, as we show by applying it to an open system based on two fermions coupled via superconductive pairing.</p>

            <p>Long-range bipartite entanglement (LBE) and its distribution properties are studied in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions (ELRIs and PLRIs). LBE quantified by two-qubit concurrence decays exponentially along with two-site distance in the infinite chain with ELRIs in the thermodynamic limit, and the long-range behavior of two-spin entanglement can detect the quantum phase transition and identify different quantum phases away from the critical point. Moreover, a fine-grained LBE distribution relation is obtained for the infinite XXZ spin chain. On the other hand, in the finite XXZ spin chain with the conventional PLRIs, the long-range concurrence decays algebraically and the total one is no longer monotonic along with the chain length. The total LBE distribution property can exhibit a piecewise function, which has a close relationship with the decaying mode and strength of PLRIs. These LBE relations can be regarded as the generalization of Koashi-BuÅ¾ek-Imoto bound for the prototypical long-range XXZ model, having potential applications in quantum information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> AdriÃ  Labay-Mora, Alberto Mercurio, Vincenzo Savona, Gian Luca Giorgi, Fabrizio Minganti</p>
            <p>We introduce a SchrÃ¶dinger chiral cat qubit, a novel bosonic quantum code generalizing Kerr cat qubits that exploits higher-order nonlinearities. Compared to a standard Kerr cat, the chiral cat qubit allows additional correction of bit-flip errors within the Hilbert space of a single bosonic oscillator. Indeed, this code displays optical bistability, i.e., the simultaneous presence of multiple long-lived states. Two of them define the code space and two define an error space. Thanks to the chiral structure of the phase space of this system, the error space can be engineered to ``capture'' bit flip events in the code space (a bit-flip trap), without affecting the quantum information stored in the system. Therefore, it is possible to perform detection and correction of errors. We demonstrate how this topological effect can be particularly efficient in the presence of large dephasing. We provide concrete examples of the performance of the code and show the possibility of applying quantum operations rapidly and efficiently. Beyond the interest in this single technological application, our work demonstrates how the topology of phase space can enhance the performance of bosonic codes.</p>

            <p>Silicon spin qubits are promising candidates for building scalable quantum computers due to their nanometre scale features. However, delivering microwave control signals locally to each qubit poses a challenge and instead methods that utilise global control fields have been proposed. These require tuning the frequency of selected qubits into resonance with a global field while detuning the rest to avoid crosstalk. Common frequency tuning methods, such as electric-field-induced Stark shift, are insufficient to cover the frequency variability across large arrays of qubits. Here, we argue that electron motion, and especially the recently demonstrated high-fidelity shuttling, can be leveraged to enhance frequency tunability. Our conclusions are supported by numerical simulations proving its efficiency on concrete architectures such as a 2$\times$N array of qubits and the recently introduced looped pipeline architecture. Specifically, we show that the use of our schemes enables single-qubit fidelity improvements up to a factor of 100 compared to the state-of-the-art. Finally, we show that our scheme can naturally be extended to perform two-qubit gates globally.</p>

            <p>Symmetry inherent in quantum states has been widely used to reduce the effect of noise in quantum error correction and a quantum error mitigation technique known as symmetry verification. However, these symmetry-based techniques exploit symmetry in quantum states rather than quantum channels, limiting their application to cases where the entire circuit shares the same symmetry. In this work, we propose symmetric channel verification (SCV), a channel purification protocol that leverages the symmetry inherent in quantum channels. By introducing different phases to each symmetric subspace and employing a quantum phase estimation-like circuit, SCV can detect and correct symmetry-breaking noise in quantum channels. We further propose a hardware-efficient implementation of SCV at the virtual level, which requires only a single-qubit ancilla and is robust against the noise in the ancilla qubit. Our protocol is applied to various Hamiltonian simulation circuits and phase estimation circuits, resulting in a significant reduction of errors. Furthermore, in setups where only Clifford unitaries can be used for noise purification, which is relevant in the early fault-tolerant regime, we show that SCV under Pauli symmetry represents the optimal purification method.</p>

            <p>Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for harnessing the potential of near-term quantum devices to address complex challenges across quantum science and technology. Yet, the robust and scalable quantification of entanglement in many-body quantum systems remains a significant challenge, crucial for both advancing theoretical understanding and enabling practical applications. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm to evaluate the $M$-partite geometric entanglement across arbitrary partitions of an $N$-qubit system into $M$ parties. By constructing tailored variational ansatz circuits for both single- and multi-qubit parties, we optimize the overlap between a target quantum state and an $M$-partite variational separable state. This method provides a flexible and scalable approach for characterizing arbitrary $M$-partite entanglement in complex quantum systems of a given dimension. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed by reproducing known analytical results. We further demonstrate its capability to evaluate entanglement among $M$ parties for any given conventional or unconventional partitions of one- and two-dimensional spin systems, both near and at a quantum critical point. Our results establish the versatility of the variational approach in capturing different types of entanglement in various quantum systems, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. Our approach offers a powerful methodology for advancing research in quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and quantum field theory. Additionally, we discuss its advantages, highlighting its adaptability to diverse system architectures in the context of near-term quantum devices.</p>

We investigate in detail the generalized 4-body Hopfield model obtained through this procedure and show that it realizes a transition from a memory retrieval to a memory black-out regime, i.e. a spin-glass phase, as the amount of stored memory increases. The mapping enables novel routes to the realization and investigation of disordered and complex classical systems via efficient photonic quantum simulators, as well as the description of aspects of structured photonic systems in terms of classical spin Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>In this work, we observe a novel resonant mechanism, namely the modulation-induced Feshbach resonance. By applying a far-detuned laser to the cesium D2 transition with intensity modulation, we periodically shake the energy levels of atomic collisional states. This periodic shaking connects the free-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we observe significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling between these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of Feshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field domain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of molecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these bound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum, which are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based on molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a magnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic interactions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new Feshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic resonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new opportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</p>

            <p>Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Developing sensors with large particle numbers $N$ that can resolve subtle physical effects is a central goal in precision measurement science. Entangled quantum sensors can surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), where the signal variance scales as $1/N$, and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL) with variance scaling as $1/N^2$. However, entangled states are typically more sensitive to noise, especially common-mode noise such as magnetic field fluctuations, control phase noise, or vibrations in atomic interferometers. We propose a two-node entanglement-enhanced quantum sensor network for differential signal estimation that intrinsically rejects common-mode noise while remaining robust against local, uncorrelated noise. This architecture enables sensitivities approaching the Heisenberg limit. We investigate two state preparation strategies: (i) unitary entanglement generation analogous to bosonic two-mode squeezing, yielding Heisenberg scaling; and (ii) dissipative preparation via collective emission into a shared cavity mode, offering a $\sqrt{N}$ improvement over the SQL. Numerical simulations confirm that both protocols remain effective under realistic conditions, supporting scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in the presence of dominant common-mode noise.</p>

            <p>Entanglement serves as a fundamental resource for various quantum information processing tasks. Fidelity of entanglement (which measures the proximity to a maximally entangled state) and various quantum entropies are key indicators for certifying entanglement in a quantum state. Quantum states with high fidelity are particularly useful for numerous information-theoretic applications. Similarly, states possessing negative conditional entropy provide significant advantages in several quantum information processing protocols. In this work, we examine the relationship between these two indicators of entanglement, both in state and channel regimes. First, we present a comprehensive analysis and characterization of channels that reduce fidelity of entanglement beyond a threshold limit of bipartite composite systems. In this context, we introduce the notion of fidelity annihilating channel and discuss its topological characterization, along with various information-theoretic properties. We then provide a comparison between channels that diminish the fidelity of entanglement and negative conditional entropies, using the depolarizing channel as an illustrative example. In particular, we determine the parameter regimes in which the depolarizing channel belongs to a given family and establish connections among these families of channels. Extending our analysis from channels to the state level, we further examine the relationship between the fidelity of entanglement and various quantum entropies for general two-qubit states. We derive the upper bound on RÃ©nyi 2-entropy, conditional RÃ©nyi 2-entropy, Tsallis 2-entropy, and conditional Tsallis 2-entropy, in terms of the fidelity of entanglement. Finally, we explore the relationship between relative entropy and the fidelity of entanglement of a two qudit quantum state.</p>

            <p>Quantum state tomography (QST), the process of reconstructing some unknown quantum state $\hat\rho$ from repeated measurements on copies of said state, is a foundationally important task in the context of quantum computation and simulation. For this reason, a detailed characterization of the error $\Delta\hat\rho = \hat\rho-\hat\rho^\prime$ in a QST reconstruction $\hat\rho^\prime$ is of clear importance to quantum theory and experiment. In this work, we develop a fully random matrix theory (RMT) treatment of state tomography in informationally-complete bases; and in doing so we reveal deep connections between QST errors $\Delta\hat\rho$ and the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). By exploiting this connection we prove that wide classes of functions of the spectrum of $\Delta\hat\rho$ can be evaluated by substituting samples of an appropriate GUE for realizations of $\Delta\hat\rho$. This powerful and flexible result enables simple analytic treatments of the mean value and variance of the error as quantified by the trace distance $\|\Delta\hat\rho\|_\mathrm{Tr}$ (which we validate numerically for common tomographic protocols), allows us to derive a bound on the QST sample complexity, and subsequently demonstrate that said bound doesn't change under the most widely-used rephysicalization procedure. These results collectively demonstrate the flexibility, strength, and broad applicability of our approach; and lays the foundation for broader studies of RMT treatments of QST in the future.</p>

We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity-induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Furthermore, our scheme allows for testing whether the observed gravity-induced entanglement is consistent with the quantum equivalence principle. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.</p>

            <h2>Memory effects in a dynamical decoupling process</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. C. Hou, X. Y. Zhang, Si-wen Li, X. X. Yi</p>
            <p>We establish a simple quantitative relationship between the environmental memory effects and the characteristics in a dynamical decoupling process. In contrast to previous works, our measures of non-Markovianity are tailored and extended to evaluate the strength of memory effects in dynamical decoupling. We find that if each kick commutes with the dynamical map of the uncontrolled system, then the change of the final dynamical map or the final state brought by the control (called the "effect of control") is upper (lower) bounded by the summation (difference) of the strengths of memory effects with and without control. We propose sufficient conditions for the commutation relation for parity kicks and illustrate our finding with a dissipative quantum Rabi model by numerical simulations where one or many cycles of parity kicks are implemented on the qubit. Besides, the results show that under certain conditions, the effect of control or the increase of performance by the control may be simply proportional to the strength of memory effects with or without control.</p>

            <h2>Rigorous Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuchibhotla Aditi, Stephen Becker</p>
            <p>Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi-Sheng Chen, Xinyu Zhang, Ya-Chuan Chen</p>
            <p>We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely, the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum reinforcement learning in real-world finance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolaos G. Paterakis, Petros Karamanakos, Corey O'Meara, Georgios Papafotiou</p>
            <p>Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as a promising technology for solving complex optimization problems that arise in various engineering fields. Therefore, it holds significant promise to transform the computational foundations of power electronics. Motivated by this potential, this paper adopts a visionary perspective to examine how quantum computing could influence the evolution of power electronics in areas such as converter design, control, modulation, simulation workflows, and beyond. Within this framework, the current status, limitations, and anticipated progress of quantum algorithms and hardware are discussed, together with their potential to enable efficient solutions to large-scale, multiobjective, mixed-integer optimization problems. To place these developments in context, the paper begins with a concise tutorial on fundamental concepts in quantum computing, serving as both an introduction to the field and a bridge to its potential applications in power electronics. As a first step in this direction, the use of quantum computing for solving offline mixed-integer optimization problems commonly encountered in power electronics is examined. To this end, a simplified power electronics design problem is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and executed on quantum hardware, despite current limitations such as low qubit counts and hardware noise. This demonstration marks a pioneering step towards leveraging quantum computing in power electronics and motivates the value of early adoption and exploration. Building on these insights, the paper outlines a forward-looking vision in which quantum computing becomes an integral part of the computational landscape of power electronics, guiding its transition from classical to quantum-enabled design and operation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Mahdian, Ali Babapour-Azar, Zahra Mousavi, Rashed Khanjani-Shiraz</p>
            <p>Quantum measurements are inherently noisy, hindering reliable entanglement detection and limiting the scalability of quantum technologies. While error mitigation and correction strategies exist, they often impose prohibitive resource overheads. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to achieve noise-resilient entanglement classification even with imperfect measurements. Using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on features extracted from Pauli measurements, we develop a robust optimal entanglement witness (ROEW) that remains effective under unknown measurement noise. By optimizing SVM parameters against worst-case errors, our protocol significantly outperforms conventional methods in classification accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ROEW achieves high-fidelity entanglement detection with minimal measurements, even when measurement errors exceed 10\%. This work bridges machine learning and quantum information science, offering a practical tool for noise-robust quantum characterization and advancing the feasibility of entanglement-based technologies in real-world settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghwa Ji, Junseo Lee, Myeongjin Shin, IlKwon Sohn, Kabgyun Jeong</p>
            <p>In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural architectures.</p>

This algorithm combines the advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.</p>

            <p>Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional scattering theory is recovered.</p>

            <p>The quantum form of the PoincarÃ© recurrence theorem stipulates that a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and discrete energy levels returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a finite time. Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of PoincarÃ© revivals. Our study of quantum recurrence provides new insight into how thermalization emerges in isolated quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Stationary potential scattering admits a formulation in terms of the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. We use this formulation to give a proof of the reciprocity theorem in two and three dimensions that does not rely on the properties of the scattering operator, Green's functions, or Green's identities. In particular, we identify reciprocity with an operator identity satisfied by an integral operator $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$, called the fundamental transfer matrix. This is a multi-dimensional generalization of the transfer matrix $\mathbf{M}$ of potential scattering in one dimension that stores the information about the scattering amplitude of the potential. We use the property of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ that is responsible for reciprocity to identify the analog of the relation, $\det{\mathbf{M}}=1$, in two and three dimensions, and establish a generic anti-pseudo-Hermiticity of the scattering operator. Our results apply for both real and complex potentials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mpemba effect in parity-time symmetric systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanchen Ma, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has been demonstrated in both closed and open Hermitian quantum systems. While some studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points--non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level--in open Hermitian quantum systems, it remains largely unexplored whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we demonstrate unequivocally the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Using established quantifiers for QMPE, we show numerically that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Interestingly, neither Hamiltonian nor Liouvillian exceptional points demarcate the boundaries of the QMPE regime. To complement numerical results, we develop an analytical description based on a long-time approximation of the relaxation dynamics of quantifiers. This approach allows us to decipher the number of intersections between two dynamical trajectories of quantifier starting from two initial conditions in the validity regime of the long-time approximation, thereby providing additional information that delineate the parameter regimes supporting the genuine QMPE. We further demonstrate the robustness of QMPE against increasing the number of qubits and dephasing effect. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also suggest its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points.</p>

            <p>Quantum information quantities, such as mutual information and entropies, are essential for characterizing quantum systems and protocols in quantum information science. In this contribution, we identify types of information measures based on generalized divergences and prove their invariance under local isometric or unitary transformations. Leveraging the reversal channel for local isometries together with the data processing inequality, we establish invariance for information quantities used in both asymptotic and one-shot regimes without relying on the specific functional form of the underlying divergence. These invariances can be applied to improve the computation of such information quantities or optimize protocols and their output states whose performance is determined by some invariant measure. Our results improve the capability to characterize and compute many operationally relevant information measures with application across the field of quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Complementarity constitutes a central aspect of quantum theory. It manifests itself, for example, in a two-way interferometer, where the simultaneous observation of an interference pattern and the acquisition of which-way information are limited by an inequality known as the duality relation. Here, we investigate which-way information in a double-slit interferometer and show that it can be correlated to the phase of the quantum object at the detection screen, leading to a phase-dependent which-way knowledge. In specific cases, this knowledge can locally exceed the limit set by the duality relation. Based on this observation, we propose a feed-forward protocol that aims at maximizing the which-way information locally for each phase after the particle has been recorded on the screen. This allows us to surpass the duality relation limit even globally. We present analytical results as a proof of principle of our protocol as well as numerical outcomes quantifying the amount of maximally achievable which-way knowledge.</p>

After the whole training procedure, we provide an efficiently computable lower bound on the fidelities for arbitrary states within the subspace, which guarantees the performance of the algorithm in the worst-case training scenario. We also show our cost function exhibits a barren-plateau-free region near the initial parameters at each iteration in the training landscape. The experimental demonstration of the algorithm is presented through the simulation of a 2-qubit Ising model on an IBMQ processor. As a demonstration for a larger system, a simulation of a 10-qubit Ising model is also provided.</p>

            <p>We pursue the identification of quantum resources carried by topological order, by evaluating quantum magic, quantified through the rank-$2$ Stabilizer RÃ©nyi entropy $\mathcal{M}_2$, in one-dimensional systems hosting symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTP). Focusing on models with an exact duality between an SPTP and a trivial one, namely the dimerized XX and the Cluster-Ising chains, we show that dual points exhibit identical amounts of magic, even thought they belong to distinct topological sectors. A subextensive asymmetry arises only under open boundary conditions, where edge effects break the duality, but this correction is non-topological and depends on microscopic parameters. These results stand in contrast to the case of topological frustration, where delocalized excitations enhance the magic logarithmically with system size. They also complement recent analyses in the literature, showing that the total magic is largely insensitive to the presence of topological order, hence suggesting that topological order is not necessarily a genuine computational resource.</p>

Yet the QFIM is costly to obtain directly, usually requiring more state preparation than its classical counterpart: the classical Fisher information matrix (CFIM).

Furthermore, we obtain the variance of CFIM ($O(N^{-1})$) and establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds ($\exp(-\Theta(N)t^2)$), demonstrating that using few random measurement bases is sufficient to approximate the QFIM accurately, especially in high-dimensional settings.

            <p>Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $Â°(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality: \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|. \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}. Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</p>

            <p>Quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structure, such as symmetry or encoding, in a fair manner constitutes a core challenge in the benchmarking of quantum technologies. This paper introduces the Reference-Contingent Complexity (RCC), an information-theoretic measure calibrated by the available quantum operations. The core idea is to leverage the quantum relative entropy to quantify the deviation of a quantum state from its "structured vacuum"-namely, the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace-thereby only pricing the process of creating non-trivial information. Our central result is a key theorem that rigorously proves the RCC serves as a lower bound for the complexity of any universal quantum circuit. This lower bound is comprised of a linear dominant term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction term that accounts for non-uniformity in the spectral distribution. Crucially, we establish a set of operational protocols, grounded in tasks like quantum hypothesis testing, which make this theoretical lower bound experimentally "auditable." This work provides a "ruler" for quantum technology that is structure-fair and enables cross-platform comparison, thereby establishing a strictly verifiable constraint between the computational cost of the process and the structured information of the final state.</p>

            <p>Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.</p>

            <p>When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maksim Maksimov, Nikita Borodin, Daria Kargina, Dmitry Naumov, Dmitry Karlovets</p>
            <p>We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</p>

            <h2>Emulation of Coherent Absorption of Quantum Light in a Programmable Linear Photonic Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Govind Krishna, Jun Gao, Sam O Brien, Rohan Yadgirkar, Venkatesh Deenadayalan, Stefan Preble, Val Zwiller, Ali W. Elshaari</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption. Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes. Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 1 for single-photon states and 3.4 for NOON states, the latter exceeding the shot-noise limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4 for two-photon states. The experiment integrates quantum state generation, programmable photonic circuitry, and photon-number-resolving detection, establishing ancilla-assisted circuits as powerful tools for programmable quantum state engineering, filtering, multiplexed sensing, and nonunitary quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Noise-induced decoherence-free zones for anyons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Bittner</p>
            <p>We develop a stochastic framework for anyonic systems in which the exchange phase is promoted from a fixed parameter to a fluctuating quantity. Starting from the Stratonovich stochastic Liouville equation, we perform the Stratonovich--ItÃ´ conversion to obtain a Lindblad master equation that ties the dissipator directly to the distorted anyon algebra. This construction produces a statistics--dependent dephasing channel, with rates determined by the eigenstructure of the real symmetric correlation matrix $D_{ab}$. The eigenvectors of $D$ select which collective exchange currents -- equivalently, which irreducible representations of the system -- are protected from stochastic dephasing, providing a natural mechanism for decoherence-free subspaces and noise-induced exceptional points. The key result of our analysis is the universality of the optimal statistical angle: in the minimal two-site model with balanced gain and loss, the protected mode always minimizes its dephasing at $\theta^\star = \pi/2$, independent of the specific form of $D$. This robustness highlights a simple design rule for optimizing coherence in noisy anyonic systems, with direct implications for ultracold atomic realizations and other emerging platforms for fractional statistics.</p>

            <h2>Communication-Optimal Blind Quantum Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Davies, Alastair Kay</p>
            <p>A user, Alice, wants to get server Bob to implement a quantum computation for her. However, she wants to leave him blind to what she's doing. What are the minimal communication resources Alice must use in order to achieve information-theoretic security? In this paper, we consider a single step of the protocol, where Alice conveys to Bob whether or not he should implement a specific gate. We use an entropy-bounding technique to quantify the minimum number of qubits that Alice must send so that Bob cannot learn anything about the gate being implemented. We provide a protocol that saturates this bound. In this optimal protocol, the states that Alice sends may be entangled. For Clifford gates, we prove that it is sufficient for Alice to send separable states.</p>

            <h2>Compiling Any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ into a (Succinct) Classical Interactive Argument</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Huang, Yael Tauman Kalai</p>
            <p>We present a generic compiler that converts any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ protocol into a succinct interactive argument where the communication and the verifier are classical, and where post-quantum soundness relies on the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of the Learning with Errors ($\mathsf{LWE}$) problem. Prior to this work, such a compiler for $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ was given by Kalai, Lombardi, Vaikuntanathan and Yang (STOC 2022), but the post-quantum soundness of this compiler is still under investigation. More generally, our compiler can be applied to any $\mathsf{QIP}$ protocol which is sound only against semi-malicious provers that follow the prescribed protocol, but with possibly malicious initial state. Our compiler consists of two steps. We first show that if a language $\mathcal{L}$ has a $\mathsf{QIP}$ with semi-malicious soundness, where the prover runs in time $T$, then $\mathcal{L} \in \mathsf{QMATIME}(T)$. Then we construct a succinct classical argument for any such language, where the communication complexity grows polylogarithmically with $T$, under the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of $\mathsf{LWE}$. Note: After this work was finished, an independent and concurrent work (Baroni et al. 2025) resolved the question of quantum soundness of the KLVY compiler.</p>

            <p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks or KANs have shown the ability to outperform classical Deep Neural Networks, while using far fewer trainable parameters for regression problems on scientific domains. Even more powerful has been their interpretability due to their structure being composed of univariate B-Spline functions. This enables us to derive closed-form equations from trained KANs for a wide range of problems. This paper introduces a quantum-inspired variant of the KAN based on Quantum Data Re-uploading (DR) models. The Quantum-Inspired Re-uploading KAN or QuIRK model replaces B-Splines with single-qubit DR models as the univariate function approximator, allowing them to match or outperform traditional KANs while using even fewer parameters. This is especially apparent in the case of periodic functions. Additionally, since the model utilizes only single-qubit circuits, it remains classically tractable to simulate with straightforward GPU acceleration. Finally, we also demonstrate that QuIRK retains the interpretability advantages and the ability to produce closed-form solutions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Squeezing-Induced Algebraic Non-Hermitian Skin Effects and Ultra Spectral Sensitivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing.</p>

            <p>A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is, correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</p>

            <p>Understanding the noise characteristics of quantum processors is crucial when achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, typical qubit designs are often studied under the Markovian approximation, which does not fully capture realistic dynamics. Factors such as qubit-qubit coupling and extended bath correlation times can introduce significant non-Markovian effects into the noise processes. In this study, we employ the Post-Markovian Master Equation (PMME) formalism to characterize memory effects in the noise dynamics. We further experimentally validate the PMME framework using superconducting qubits on an IBM Quantum device, demonstrating clear non-Markovian behavior during circuit execution. Additionally, we quantify the crosstalk effect using an information-theoretic approach and reveal that crosstalk can dominate the observed non-Markovian effects in current quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Constructing a quantum computer capable of broad and important applications is likely to require millions of addressable physical qubits, posing the challenge of large-scale integration of quantum systems with classical electronics. Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology has been used to develop a range of cryogenic electronic components for the control and readout of different qubit modalities interfaced on separate chips. However, recent measurements of quantum dots on this technology raise the tantalising prospect of realising control electronics and spin qubits on the same manufacturing platform, within a single integrated circuit (IC). Here, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout in addressable quantum dot devices within an IC fabricated using industry-standard 22 nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology. We achieve spin-to-charge conversion via a ramped energy-selective measurement, detected using a radio-frequency single-electron transistor and addressed by on-chip cryogenic electronics. The observation of consistent readout visibilities exceeding 90% and millisecond spin relaxation times in two nominally identical devices within the addressable array supports the reproducibility of the unit cell. The successful observation of spin readout using this CMOS process marks a key step towards realising highly scalable and integrated spin qubits.</p>

Although superseded by the Dirac equation and modern quantum electrodynamics, the semiclassical approach offers a historically and pedagogically valuable perspective. Using the Sommerfeld fine structure formula and computer algebra methods, we demonstrate the appearance of self-intersecting orbits in super strong Coulomb fields, beginning with Oganesson and hypothetical elements up to $Z\le137$. These orbits can be classified by their `winding' numbers, providing a simple topological description of Coulomb field strength in this framework.

            <p>Interaction between light and high-frequency sound is a key area in integrated photonics, quantum and nonlinear optics, and quantum science. However, the typical suspended optomechanical structures suffer from poor thermal anchoring, making them susceptible to thermal noise arising from optical absorption. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, release-free silicon optomechanical crystal cavity (OMC) operating cryogenically with improved resilience to laser light. Relative to a suspended nanobeam OMC, we observe an 18 dB suppression of the thermo-optic effect, and the device sustains near-unity phonon occupation at 35 dB higher intracavity optical energy. Time-resolved measurements further reveal rapid initial thermalization governed by the mechanical decay time. With further material and design improvements in sight, these results bolster release-free systems on a chip as a path for low-noise and high-power classical and quantum electro-optomechanics, such as for frequency converters between microwave and optical photons.</p>

            <p>Communication in quantum networks suffers notoriously from photon loss. Resulting errors can be mitigated with a suitable measurement herald at the receiving node. However, waiting for a herald and communicating the measurement result back to the sender in a repeat-until-success strategy makes the protocol slow and prone to errors from false heralds such as detector dark counts. Here we implement an entanglement herald at the sending node by employing a cascaded two-photon emission of a single atom into two optical fiber cavities: The polarization of one photon is entangled with the spin of the atom, and the second photon heralds entanglement generation. We show that heralding improves the atom-photon entanglement in-fiber efficiency and fidelity to 68(3)% and 87(2)%, respectively. We highlight the potential of our source for noise-limited long-distance quantum communication by extending the range for constant fidelity or, alternatively, increasing the fidelity for a given distance.</p>

            <p>This work systematically investigates the phase diagram of a parallel double-quantum-dot Andreev molecule, where the two quantum dots are coupled to a common superconducting lead. Using the numerical renormalization group method, we map out the evolution of the ground state across a wide parameter space of level detunings, size of the superconducting gap, lead couplings, and inter-dot coupling strength. The intricate phase diagrams feature singlet, doublet, and a relatively uncommon triplet ground states, with the latter being a distinct signature of strong lead-mediated interactions between the quantum dots. We benchmark the applicability of simplified effective models, including the atomic limit and zero-bandwidth approximations, in capturing the complex behavior of this parallel configuration. Our analysis reveals severe limitations of these models, underscoring the necessity for maximal caution when extrapolating beyond their tested validity. In particular, all effective models except for the extended version of the zero-bandwidth approximation failed in reproducing the triplet ground state and made several false predictions. These findings provide crucial insights for interpreting experimental observations and designing superconducting devices based on quantum-dot architectures.</p>

            <p>Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead, also known as the interacting resonant level model in quantum impurity physics. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.</p>

In this paper, we implement the information fusion and correction with Dempster-Shafer structure on quantum circuits, demonstrating that belief functions provide a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing this http URL, by leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel approaches for belief transfer.

For a mesoscopic sized ring under the effect of an artificial gauge field, we analyze the energy spectrum, the particle density and the current flowing through the impurity at varying interaction strengths, barrier heights, and number of components. We find that the physics of the system is governed by the competition between effective single-particle process and the formation of a high-stiffness spin-correlated state associated to the phenomenon of fractionalization of the flux quantum characterizing the $N$-component fermionic system. Our findings provide a route to probe the response of SU($N$) fermions to effective magnetic fields; at the same time, they hold significance for fundamental understanding of localized impurity problems.</p>

            <p>Understanding intricate magnetic structures in materials is essential for advancing materials science, spintronics, and geology. Recent developments of quantum-enabled magnetometers, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, have enabled direct imaging of magnetic field distributions across a wide range of magnetic profiles. However, reconstructing the magnetization from an experimentally measured magnetic field map is a complex inverse problem, further complicated by measurement noise, finite spatial resolution, and variations in sample-to-sensor distance. In this work, we present a novel and efficient GPU-accelerated method for reconstructing spatially varying magnetization density from measured magnetic fields with minimal prior assumptions. We validate our method by simulating diverse magnetic structures under realistic experimental conditions, including multi-domain ferromagnetism and magnetic spin textures such as skyrmion, anti-skyrmion, and meron. Experimentally, we reconstruct the magnetization of a micrometer-scale Apollo lunar mare basalt (sample 10003,184) and a nanometer-scale twisted double-trilayer CrI3. The basalt exhibits soft ferromagnetic domains consistent with previous paleomagnetic studies, whereas the CrI3 system reveals a well-defined hexagonal magnetic Moire superlattice. Our approach provides a versatile and universal tool for investigating complex magnetization profiles, paving the way for future quantum sensing experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flynn Linton, Shubhanshu Tiwari</p>
            <p>Understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity is a crucial step towards unifying these two fundamental ideas. Recent theoretical developments have explored how global properties of spacetime would cause a quantum spatial superposition to lose coherence. In particular, this loss of coherence is closely related to the memory effect, which is a prominent feature of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore how a burst of gravitational radiation from a far-away source would decohere a quantum superposition. We identify the individual contributions to the decoherence from the memory and oscillatory components of the gravitational wave source, corresponding to soft and hard graviton emissions, respectively. In general, the memory contributions dominate, while the oscillatory component of the decoherence is strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work demonstrates how quantum systems can lose coherence from interactions with a classical gravitational field. We also comment on the electromagnetic analogue of this effect and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.</p>

Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</p>

            <p>Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $\sim 80\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</p>

            <h2>Observing Spatial Charge and Spin Correlations in a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cyprien Daix, Maxime Dixmerias, Yuan-Yao He, Joris Verstraten, Tim de Jongh, Bruno Peaudecerf, Shiwei Zhang, Tarik Yefsah</p>
            <p>In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal nonlocal anticorrelations in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.</p>

            <p>Hyper-Ramsey protocols effectively reduce AC-Stark shifts in probing ultra-narrow optical clock transitions but they remain sensitive to laser intensity noise, decoherence, frequency drifts, and low-frequency perturbations. We address these limitations by incorporating dynamical decoupling, using sequences of rotary Hahn-echo pulses that toggle the probe frequency detuning and phase between opposite signs. Implementing time-optimized Eulerian cycling circuits of multiple refocusing pulses, we generate high-contrast hyper-Ramsey interferences that are completely free from AC-Stark shifts and robust against environmental noise and laser probe parameters imperfections. Fault- tolerant dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks are a significant step toward universal, noise-resilient quantum sensors, enabling fault-tolerant metrology for searches about new physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

            <h2>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber</p>
            <p>In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</p>

            <h2>Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng He, Arthur Hutsalyuk, Giuseppe Mussardo, Andrea Stampiggi</p>
            <p>Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongkun Chen, Daohong Xu, Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, Jeff D. Thompson, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</p>

            <h2>Stroboscopic Saturation of Multiparameter Quantum Limits in Distributed Quantum Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Berihu Teklu, Victor Montenegro</p>
            <p>High-precision sensors that exploit uniquely quantum phenomena have been shown to surpass the standard quantum limit of measurement precision. However, in the general scenario where multiple parameters are simultaneously encoded in a quantum probe, while surpassing the standard quantum limit is possible, its practical attainability is severely hindered. This difficulty arises due to the fundamental incompatibility among the optimal measurements required for estimating different parameters. A naturally multiparameter sensing scenario emerges when a network of quantum sensors is spatially distributed, with each individual sensor probing a distinct parameter of interest. The central goal in such a setting is twofold: first, to surpass the standard quantum limit in estimating global properties of the system -- thereby achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity for a given network size -- and second, to explicitly identify the optimal measurement strategies necessary to practically attain this quantum advantage. Here, we analytically demonstrate quantum-enhanced sensitivity for a broad class of distributed quantum probes, including cases where the precision scales quadratically or quartically with the sensing resources. We construct the corresponding optimal measurement strategies that achieve the ultimate precision limits -- namely, saturation of both the Holevo and quantum CramÃ©r-Rao bounds. We then apply our framework to two concrete scenarios: the simultaneous estimation of multiple gravitational accelerations (gravimetry) and coupling strengths across spatially separated locations. Feasibility analyses indicate that the proposed distributed quantum-enhanced sensing schemes are within reach of current experimental capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jai Lalita, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>The interplay of non-classical volume, von Neumann entropy, entropy production, and ergotropy is investigated in various open quantum systems. Two categories of open quantum system models are utilized: spin-spin and spin-boson interaction models. The spin-spin interaction models include the quantum collision and central spin models. On the other hand, the spin-boson interaction models consist of non-Markovian amplitude damping channel, Markovian generalized amplitude damping channel, and the Jaynes-Cummings model. Across these various open quantum systems, universal interrelations emerge, where the non-classical volume shows contrasting evolution with entropy, and entropy production contrasts with ergotropy. The initial state of the reservoir in these open quantum systems is shown to have an impact on these interrelations. These findings establish an interesting link between quantum information and the thermodynamics of open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Limits to Cat-Code Qubits from Chaos-Assisted Tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lionel E. MartÃ­nez, Ignacio GarcÃ­a-Mata, Diego A. Wisniacki</p>
            <p>We show that chaos-assisted tunneling (CAT) imposes an intrinsic limit to the protection of Kerr-cat qubits. In the static effective description, tunneling between the quasi-degenerate cat states can be exponentially suppressed, ensuring long lifetimes. However, our Floquet analysis reveals that when the nonlinearities increase, chaotic states mediate tunneling between the cat states, producing large quasi-energy splittings. We compute tunneling rates using both full quantum simulations and semiclassical WKB theory, finding quantitative agreement and confirming that the splittings are directly linked to chaos. These results provide the first evidence of CAT in the Kerr-cat qubit and demonstrate that chaos sets a fundamental bound on the coherence of dynamically protected superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Utilizing tantalum (Ta) in superconducting circuits has led to significant improvements, such as high qubit lifetimes and quality factors in both qubits and resonators, underscoring the importance of material optimization in quantum device performance. In this work, we explore superconducting gap engineering in Ta-based devices as a strategy to expand the range of viable host materials. By alloying 20 atomic percent hafnium (Hf) into Ta thin films, we achieve a superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 6.09~K, as measured by DC transport, reflecting an increased superconducting gap. We systematically vary deposition conditions to control film orientation and transport properties of the Ta-Hf alloy films. The enhancement in $T_c$ is further confirmed by microwave measurements at millikelvin temperatures. Despite the 40\% increase in $T_c$ relative to pure Ta, the loss contributions from two-level systems (TLS) and quasiparticles (QPs) remain unchanged in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the potential of material engineering to improve superconducting circuit performance and motivate further exploration of engineered alloys for quantum technologies.</p>

This principle can be applied to counting electrons in a beam without changing its quantum states. The elastic scattering operator forms an electron-counting dispersive Hamiltonian for electron-photon systems within electron microscope, and it could enable quantum- and sub-shot-noise sensing and imaging at the Ã-scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Canteri, James Bate, Ida Mishra, Nicolai Friis, Victor Krutyanskiy, Benjamin P. Lanyon</p>
            <p>The ability to establish entanglement between the nodes of future quantum networks is essential for enabling a wide range of new applications in science and technology. A promising approach involves the use of a powerful central node capable of deterministically preparing arbitrary multipartite entangled states of its matter-based qubits and efficiently distributing these states to surrounding end nodes via flying photons. This central node, referred to as a ``factory node", serves as a hub for the production and distribution of multipartite entanglement. In this work, we demonstrate key functionalities of a factory node using a cavity-integrated trapped-ion quantum processor. Specifically, we program the system to generate genuinely multipartite entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of three path-switchable photons and verify them using custom-designed entanglement witnesses. These photons can, in the future, be used to establish stored multipartite entanglement between remote matter-based nodes. Our results demonstrate that the well-established techniques for the deterministic preparation of entangled states of co-trapped ion qubits can be used to prepare the same states of traveling photons, paving the way for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum local area networks.</p>

            <p>Interaction between light and high-frequency sound is a key area in integrated photonics, quantum and nonlinear optics, and quantum science. However, the typical suspended optomechanical structures suffer from poor thermal anchoring, making them susceptible to thermal noise arising from optical absorption. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, release-free silicon optomechanical crystal cavity (OMC) operating cryogenically with improved resilience to laser light. Relative to a suspended nanobeam OMC, we observe an 18 dB suppression of the thermo-optic effect, and the device sustains near-unity phonon occupation at 35 dB higher intracavity optical energy. Time-resolved measurements further reveal rapid initial thermalization governed by the mechanical decay time. With further material and design improvements in sight, these results bolster release-free systems on a chip as a path for low-noise and high-power classical and quantum electro-optomechanics, such as for frequency converters between microwave and optical photons.</p>

            <p>High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has emerged as a versatile platform for exploring ultrafast and quantum-coherent phenomena in condensed matter. Recent advances reveal Berry-phase and topological effects in harmonic emission, strong-field control of excitons and lattice motion, the generation of nonclassical light states driven by quantum and squeezed fields, and the emergence of orbital-angular-momentum transfer in solid-state high-harmonic generation. Nanostructured and hybrid plasmonic-semiconductor platforms enable enhanced and spectrally tunable HHG, while interferometric and cryogenic setups allow attosecond-resolved phase measurements. On the theoretical side, multiband and topological models incorporating dephasing, propagation, and electron-hole coherence effects have deepened our understanding of the interplay between interband and intraband dynamics. These developments establish solid-state HHG as a bridge between ultrafast spectroscopy, quantum optics, and material science, paving the way toward quantum-engineered attosecond sources and coherent control of light-matter interactions in solids.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XY model and XXZ model with the staggered imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization, respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably, the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime of the XXZ model.</p>

            <p>We investigate how non-stabilizer resources enable the emergence of quantum state designs within the projected ensemble. Starting from initial states with finite magic and applying resource-free Clifford circuits to scramble them, we analyze the ensemble generated by performing projective Pauli measurements on a subsystem of the final state. Using both analytical arguments and large-scale numerics, we show that the projected ensemble converges towards a state $k$-design with an error that decays exponentially with the $k$-th Stabilizer Renyi Entropy of the pre-measurement state, via a Magic-Induced Design Ansatz (MIDA) that we introduce. We identify a universal scaling form, valid across different classes of magic initial states, and corroborate it through numerical simulations and analytical calculations of the frame potential. For finite-depth Clifford unitaries, we show that the timescales at which state designs emerge are controlled by the transport of magic. We identify a ``magic teleportation'' mechanism whereby non-Clifford resources injected locally spread through Clifford scrambling and measurements across distances beyond the lightcone. Our results demonstrate how a small and controlled amount of magic suffices to generate highly random states, providing a systematic route toward generating quantum state designs in early fault-tolerant devices.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interaction in the regime of strong quantum coupling is usually treated within the framework of the Hopfield model. However, the picture of coupling well-defined modes of light and matter is correct only as long as the shapes of these eigenmodes are not substantially modified by the interaction. Moreover, parameters of theoretical models are usually obtained by fitting to experimental data. To date, there has been no straightforward method to determine a quantum master equation corresponding to a system with specific dielectric structure, which may lead to incompatibility of theoretical descriptions and physical realizations. We present a recipe for obtaining a quantum model in the polariton eigenmode basis based on Bogoliubov transformation in the conservative case and third quantization technique in the dissipative case. We show how this method can be used for boosting interaction strength and engineering nonlocal many-body interactions in carefully designed nanostructures, resulting in strongly nonclassical correlations of emitted light.</p>

            <p>Entanglement generation in polariton systems is fundamentally constrained by high losses and decoherence, which typically outweigh polariton nonlinearities. Here, we propose a conceptually different approach that uses optomechanical interactions, rather than polariton-polariton interactions, to generate entangled polaritons. Our double-resonant scheme relies on strong exciton-phonon coupling, found in both inorganic and molecular semiconductors, enabling room-temperature generation of spectrally disparate photon pairs. The quantum coherent and delocalized nature of polariton states inside optical cavities ensures efficient single-mode outcoupling and allows for unconditional quantum state preparation - not relying on any post-selection or projective measurements. When conditioned on exciton-polariton emission, single phonon-polariton states can be prepared that subsequently yield bright, heralded single-photon emission in the mid-IR/THz. We introduce a double-resonant optomechanical platform that enables scalable, room-temperature quantum polaritonics without relying on conventional excitonic nonlinearities.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <h2>Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junming Wu, Shihao Zhou, Benedetta Flebus, Wei Zhang</p>
            <p>Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.</p>

            <h2>Tunable quantum Mpemba effect in long-range interacting systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Hallam, Matthew Yusuf, Aashish A. Clerk, Ivar Martin, Zlatko PapiÄ</p>
            <p>Symmetry plays a fundamental role in many-body systems, both in and out of equilibrium. The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems initially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in terms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically restored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ model with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field. In the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system develops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when interactions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between the external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We systematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on the effective temperature set by the initial state. Our results demonstrate the tunability of the QME via long-range interactions, which can be probed in experimental platforms of trapped ions, polar molecules, and NV centers.</p>

            <h2>Many-body post-processing of density functional calculations using the variational quantum eigensolver for Bader charge analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Schultheis, Alexander Rehn, Gabriel Breuil</p>
            <p>Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. Further, estimating properties of a material is crucial to evaluate its industrial applications. To investigate charge distributions of weakly and strongly correlated systems we calculate Bader charges for various periodic systems by solving many-body Hamiltonians using the variational quantum eigensolver. The Hamiltonians are computed from Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate the accuracy of our method on various doped MgH2 supercells. Further, we show that our approach, compared to standard DFT, significantly improves the Bader charge values for strongly correlated transition metal oxides, where we take DFT+U results as a reference. The computational framework behind our many-body calculations, called Dopyqo, is made openly available as a software package.</p>

            <p>A promising use of quantum networking is quantum key distribution (QKD), which can provide information-theoretic security unattainable by classical means. While optical fiber-based QKD networks suffer from exponential loss, satellite-assisted quantum communication offers a scalable solution for long-distance secure key exchange. In this work, we propose and evaluate a satellite-based QKD setup covering the Iberian Peninsula, linking Madrid with Barcelona, Bilbao, and Lisbon. Our proposed setup uses a Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) state-of-the-art satellite equipped with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source to distribute entangled photon pairs to ground stations. Considering vibrations in the satellite, we optimize the beam waist to enhance the transmission probability and improve the secret key rate (SKR). Our results show that key rates sufficient for real-world applications, such as secure communication between hospitals, using hybrid classical-quantum protocols are feasible with existing protocols. Our results highlight the viability of near-term satellite-based QKD networks for national-scale secure communications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai Xiang, Yue-Hui Lu, Jacquelyn Ho, Tsai-Chen Lee, Zhenjie Yan, Dan M. Stamper-Kurn</p>
            <p>Ladder-type two-photon excitation of an atom from a ground state $|g\rangle$, to an intermediate excited state $|e\rangle$, and, finally, to a Rydberg state $|r\rangle$, has a variety of uses from quantum information to sensing. A common scheme for detecting this transition optically is through electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, in inverted wavelength schemes, where the ground-to-excited transition wavelength is shorter than the excited-to-Rydberg transition wavelength, the strength of the EIT feature on the lower-leg beam is strongly reduced in a Doppler-broadened medium. Here, we report on an alternative two-photon spectroscopic feature, which we term the two-photon Autler-Townes resonance, observed on the upper-leg beam. Compared to the EIT signal, this feature's superior signal-to-noise ratio allows one to resolve Rydberg resonances with principal quantum number as high as $n=80$. We also show that such a feature can be utilized to generate an error signal for stabilizing the frequency of the upper-leg beam.</p>

            <h2>Homodyne Measurement of a Non-Hermitian Qubit Undergoing Fluorescence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roson Nongthombam, Amarendra K. Sarma</p>
            <p>Implementation of a two-level non-Hermitian qubit via postselection of a three-level system has been demonstrated. The postselection procedure, which discards quantum jump to the ground-state manifold while retaining excitations in the first and second excited-state manifolds, effectively generates a non-Hermitian qubit exhibiting PT symmetry. In this work, we perform continuous homodyne mea- surement of this non-Hermitian qubit and analyze the interplay between decay introduced by posts- election and measurement backaction. We compare the ensemble-averaged dynamics obtained from measurement trajectories with the the Liouvillian average. We formulate the no-jump stochastic differential equation describing the postselected non-Hermitian qubit and show that its ensemble- averaged dynamics agree with those of the jump-updated postselected evolution at drive strengths far from the Liouvillian exceptional point (EP). The degree of deviation near the EP depends sensitively on the nature of the drive. This discrepancy is attributed to the interplay between measurement backaction and the non-Hermitian decay introduced by postselection. Furthermore, we determine the optimal path of the non-Hermitian qubit by extremizing the action within the path-integral formulation of the quantum trajectory framework Our results provide insights into how measurement backaction and non-Hermitian dynamics together shape the transient behavior of open quantum systems and enable controlled manipulation of qubits near exceptional points.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermal diode with additional control by auxiliary atomic states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qin Zhang, Zi-chen Zhang, Yi-jia Yang, Zheng Liu, Chang-shui Yu</p>
            <p>A quantum thermal diode, similar to an electronic diode, allows for unidirectional heat transmission. In this paper, we study a quantum thermal diode composed of two two-level atoms coupled to auxiliary two-level atoms. We find that the excited auxiliary atoms can weaken heat current and enhance the rectification effect, but the ground-state auxiliary atoms can enhance heat current and weaken the rectification effect. The more auxiliary atoms are coupled, the stronger the enhancing or weakening impact is. If the auxiliary atom is in a superposition state, we find that only the fraction that projects onto the excited state plays a significant role. In particular, if we properly design the coupling of the auxiliary atoms, the rectification effect can be eliminated. This provides the potential to control the heat current and the rectification performance by the states of the auxiliary atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Volker Karle, Oriana K. Diessel, Vasil Rokaj, Ceren B. DaÄ</p>
            <p>Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels in next-generation quantum-optical devices.</p>

            <h2>High-efficiency and long-distance quantum memory-assisted device-independent quantum secret sharing with single photon sources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhang, Jia-Wei Ying, Shi-Pu Gu, Xing-Fu Wang, Ming-Ming Du, Wei Zhong, Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng</p>
            <p>Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a critical role in building the distributed quantum networks. Device-independent (DI) QSS provides the highest security level for QSS. However, the photon transmission loss and extremely low multipartite entanglement generation rate largely limit DI QSS's secure photon transmission distance (less than 1 km) and practical key generation efficiency. To address the above drawbacks, we propose the quantum memory-assisted (QMA) DI QSS protocol based on single photon sources (SPSs). The single photons from the SPSs are used to construct long-distance multipartite entanglement channels with the help of the heralded architecture. The heralded architecture enables our protocol to have an infinite secure photon transmission distance in theory. The QMA technology can not only increase the multi-photon synchronization efficiency, but also optimize the photon transmittance to maximize the construction efficiency of the multipartite entanglement channels. Our protocol achieves the practical key generation efficiency seven orders of magnitude higher than that of the existing DI QSS protocols based on cascaded spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and six orders of magnitude higher than that of the DI QSS based on SPSs without QMA. Our protocol has modular characteristics and is feasible under the current experimental technical conditions. Combining with the advanced random key generation basis strategy, the requirement on experimental devices can be effectively reduced. Our protocol is expected to promote the development of long-distance and high-efficiency DI quantum network in the future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maksim Valialshchikov, Felix Karbstein, Daniel Seipt, Matt Zepf</p>
            <p>Quantum reflection is a fascinating signature of the quantum vacuum that emerges from inhomogeneities in the electromagnetic fields. In pursuit of the prospective real-world implementation of quantum reflection in the back-reflection channel, we provide the first numerical estimates for the light-by-light scattering with dipole pulses, which are known to provide the tightest focusing of light possible. For an all-optical setup with a dipole pump and Gaussian probe of the same frequency, we find that the dominant signal signature is related mainly to the back-reflection channel from 4-wave mixing. Focusing on this, we study the particular case of a multiple focusing pulses configuration (belt configuration) as an approximation to the idealized dipole pulse. Using Bayesian optimization methods, we determine optimal parameters that maximize the detectability of a discernible back-reflection signal. Our study indicates that the optimization favors a three-beam collision setup, which we further investigate both numerically and analytically.</p>

This engine operates using a single cold reservoir via cycles of collective pumping followed by decay. Using an effective mean-field Hamiltonian to describe the many-body dynamics, we design optimized drive pulses that preserve adiabaticity and achieve an average power output scaling quadratically with the system size, \(P \propto N^2\). An experimentally measurable figure of merit demonstrates that the efficiency of this superengine can approach unity. The resulting analytical model, which yields a representative Hamiltonian for the sample within the mean-field formalism, is validated by numerical simulations. Our results pave the way for scalable and highly efficient quantum heat engines based on collective effects.</p>

Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</p>

We demonstrate a quantum computing model that utilizes a qubit's motion to protect it from decoherence. We model a qubit interacting with a quantum field via the standard light-matter interaction model: an Unruh-DeWitt detector, i.e., the qubit, follows a prescribed classical trajectory while interacting with a scalar quantum field. We switch off the rotating-wave terms, i.e., the resonant transitions, using the technique of acceleration-induced transparency which eliminates the dominant decoherence channels by controlling the qubit's trajectory. We are able to perform one-qubit gates by stimulating the counter-rotating wave terms (i.e., the non-resonant transitions) and two-qubit gates by extracting the entanglement from the quantum field prepared in a squeezed state. Finally, we discuss the fundamental limits on quantum error protection: on the trade-off between isolating a quantum computer from decoherence, and the speed with which entangling gates may be applied, comparable to the Eastin-Knill theorem for quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable spin defects with great potential for nanoscale quantum sensing. A key application of NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among metals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and electrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies. However, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their quantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered diamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with different energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum properties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the NV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a result, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be efficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we observed a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum thin films. Our study describes the various processes affecting NV centers near platinum films and provides guidance for the integration of thin metal films with near-surface NV centers.</p>

            <p>Quantum communication in the microwave regime is set to play an important role in distributed quantum computing and hybrid quantum networks. However, typical superconducting quantum circuits require millikelvin temperatures for operation, which poses a significant challenge for largescale microwave quantum networks. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating the successful quantum teleportation of microwave coherent states between two spatially-separated dilution refrigerators over a thermal microwave channel in the temperature range up to $4$ K. We distribute two-mode squeezed states over this noisy channel and employ the resulting quantum entanglement for quantum teleportation of coherent states with fidelities of $72.3 \pm 0.5 ~\%$ at $1$ K and $59.9 \pm 2.5 \%$ at $4$ K, exceeding the no-cloning and classical communication thresholds, respectively. We successfully model the teleportation protocol using a Gaussian operator formalism that includes losses and noise. Our analysis shows that the teleportation infidelity mainly stems from a parasitic heating of the cold quantum nodes due to the hot network connection. These results demonstrate the experimental feasibility of distributed superconducting architectures and motivate further investigations of noisy quantum networks in various frequency regimes.</p>

Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local \textit{extra recoil} effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</p>

This SU($2$)-invariant measure quantifies the off-diagonal coherences of a quantum state in angular momentum bases, weighted by the classical distinguishability of the superposed states. It serves as a witness of nonclassicality and provides both upper and lower bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the set of classical (spin coherent) states. We demonstrate that many hallmark properties of the QCS carry over to the spin setting, including its links to noise susceptibility of a state and moments of quasiprobability distributions. The spin coherence scale has direct implications for quantum metrology in the guise of rotation sensing. We also generalize the framework to SU($n$) systems, identifying the unique SU($n$)-invariant depolarization channel and outlining a broad, Lie-algebraic approach to defining and characterizing the properties of coherence scale beyond harmonic oscillators.</p>

            <h2>Vari-Cool: a non-unitary quantum variational protocol for simulated cooling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey Z. Song, Gilad Kishony, Erez Berg, Mark S. Rudner</p>
            <p>We introduce a variational approach for preparing low energy states of arbitrary target Hamiltonians. The protocol is defined in terms of a repeated cycle consisting of p layers of unitary gates applied to the system and ancilla "bath" qubits, followed by reset of the bath qubits. The gate parameters within each cycle are optimized such that the steady state achieved after many cycles has a low energy expectation value with respect to the target Hamiltonian, and that the energy converges toward the steady state value in as few cycles as possible. We illustrate the protocol for the transverse field Ising model, and study its systematic behaviors with respect to system size, model parameters, and noise using tensor network based classical simulations. We then experimentally demonstrate its operation on IBM's ibm_kingston quantum processor for up to 28 system qubits coupled to 14 bath sites. Classical training on small system sizes and with few unitary layers per cycle gives robust results that transfer well to larger system sizes and to noisy hardware.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Emulation of Neutral Atom Quantum Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kemal Bidzhiev, Stefano Grava, Pablo le Henaff, Mauro Mendizabal, Elie Merhej, Anton Quelle</p>
            <p>Simulating the dynamics of neutral atom arrays is a challenging problem. To address this, we introduce two emulators, emu-sv and emu-mps, as computational backends for Pasqal's pulser package. Emu-sv is designed for high-precision state-vector simulations, giving the possibility to emulate systems of up to $\thicksim 27$ qubits on an A100 40GB GPU, making it perfect for cases where numerically exact results are needed. In contrast, emu-mps uses a Matrix Product State representation and other controlled approximations to efficiently simulate much larger arrays of atoms with manageable errors. We show through benchmark comparisons that both emulators provide significant speed-ups over generic solvers such as QuTiP. In addition, we provide practical guidance on choosing between the two emulators. These quantum software tools are designed to support researchers and developers aiming to simulate quantum systems either as a precursor to full hardware implementation or as a means of benchmarking hardware performance.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Action-Dependent Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Korenberg, Uzi Pereg</p>
            <p>We study the quantum action-dependent channel. The model can be viewed as a quantum analog of the classical action-dependent channel model. In this setting, the communication channel has two inputs: Alice's transmission and the input environment. The action-dependent mechanism enables the transmitter to influence the channel's environment through an action channel. Specifically, Alice encodes her message into a quantum action, which subsequently affects the environment state. For example, a quantum measurement at the encoder can induce a state collapse of the environment. In addition, Alice has access to side information. Unlike the classical model, she cannot have a copy of the environment state due to the no-cloning theorem. Instead, she shares entanglement with this environment. We establish an achievable communication rate for reliable message transmission via the quantum action-dependent channel, thereby extending the classical action-dependent framework to the quantum domain.</p>

            <h2>Observational entropy of quantum correlations and entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Rossetti, Stefano Mancini, Andreas Winter, Joseph Schindler</p>
            <p>The use of coarse graining to connect physical and information theoretic entropies has recently been given a precise formulation in terms of ``observational entropy'', describing entropy for observers with respect to a measurement. Here we consider observers with various locality restrictions, including local measurements (LO), measurements based on local operations with classical communication (LOCC), and separable measurements (SEP), with the idea that the ``entropy gap'' between the minimum locally measured observational entropy and the von Neumann entropy quantifies quantum correlations in a given state. After introducing entropy gaps for general classes of measurements and deriving their general properties, we specialize to LO, LOCC, SEP and other measurement classes related to the locality of subsystems. For those, we show that the entropy gap can be related to well-known measures of entanglement or non-classicality of the state (even though we point out that they are not entanglement monotones themselves). In particular, for bipartite pure states, all of the ``local'' entropy gaps reproduce the entanglement entropy, and for general multipartite states they are lower-bounded by the relative entropy of entanglement. The entropy gaps of the different measurement classes are ordered, and we show that in general (mixed and multipartite states) they are all different.</p>

            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor(SC-SM) nanowires remain one of the foremost platforms for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes(MZMs) towards fault-tolerant topological qubits, especially with the rapid development of artificial Kitaev chains. In contrast to the widely used aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of ~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance, identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap, thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially larger topological gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Zeming, Tan Naiming, Gao Chao, Yao Zhihai, Wang Xiaoqian</p>
            <p>The quantum Cheshire cat effect is an important phenomenon in quantum mechanics that reveals the separability of physical properties from their carriers. This effect transcends the classical framework whose attributes must be inherently attached to objects, providing new perspectives for quantum information and precision measurement. According to the quantum Cheshire cat effect, we prepare a pre-selected state of a spin1/2 atomic system composed of two particles through a pre-selection process. We conduct quantum weak measurements on the spins and positions of these two atoms and extract weak values by using the method of imaginary time evolution(ITE). Subsequently, we perform post-selection on these two atoms and design two distinct post-selected states. Initially, we calculate analytical solutions when both atoms encounter these two different post-selected states separately. We also compare the analytical and numerical solutions. Our research theoretically confirms the feasibility of fermionic systems within bipartite quantum Cheshire cat effects and illustrates how delayed-choice influences quantum Cheshire cat effects in spin-1/2 atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum synchronization (QS) in open many-body systems offers a promising route for controlling collective quantum dynamics, yet existing manipulation schemes often rely on dissipation engineering, which distorts limit cycles, lacks scalability, and is strongly system-dependent. Here, we propose a universal and scalable method for continuously tuning QS from maximal synchronization under isotropic interactions to complete synchronization blockade (QSB) under fully anisotropic coupling in spin oscillator networks. Our approach preserves intrinsic limit cycles and applies to both few-body and macroscopic systems. We analytically show that QS arises solely from spin flip-flop processes and their higher-order correlations, while anisotropic interactions induce non-synchronizing coherence. A geometric QS measure reveals a macroscopic QSB effect in the thermodynamic limit. The proposed mechanism is experimentally feasible using XYZ interactions and optical pumping, and provides a general framework for programmable synchronization control in complex quantum networks and dynamical phases of matter.</p>

Here we propose a theoretical scheme to investigate the monogamy of quantum steering and genuine tripartite entanglement in a hybrid qubit-cavity optomagnonic system with a coherent feedback loop. Using logarithmic negativity and Gaussian quantum steering, we quantify entanglement and steerability, respectively. We verify the CKW-type monogamy inequalities which leads to steering monogamous through adjustments of the reflective parameter among three tripartite modes versus temperature. Our results show that a coherent feedback loop can enhance entanglement and quantum steering under thermal effects.</p>

            <p>Quantum radar has emerged as a promising paradigm that utilizes entanglement and quantum correlations to overcome the limitations of classical detection in noisy and lossy environments. By exploiting microwave entanglement generated from superconducting devices such as Josephson parametric amplifiers, converters, and traveling-wave parametric amplifiers, quantum radar systems can achieve enhanced detection sensitivity, lower error probabilities, and greater robustness against thermal noise and jamming. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the field, beginning with the theoretical foundations of quantum illumination and extending to the generation of entanglement in the microwave regime. We then examine key quantum radar subsystems, including quantum transducers, amplification chains, and receiver architectures, which form the backbone of practical designs. Recent experimental systems are surveyed in the microwave domain, highlighting proof-of-principle demonstrations and their transition from conceptual frameworks to laboratory realizations. Collectively, the progress reviewed here demonstrates that quantum radar is evolving from a theoretical construct to a practical quantum technology capable of extending the performance boundaries of classical radar.</p>

In this work, we propose a scheme to investigate the nonreciprocity of bi- and tripartite entanglement and generate squeezed states in a magnomechanical system. This is achieved through the Barnett effect, which originates from the rotation of the first magnon mode. The system consists of two YIG spheres, each supporting a magnon mode that represents collective spin motion, positioned inside a microwave cavity (MC). We show that the Barnett effect enhances entanglement under thermal effects and generates squeezed states for the two magnon modes and the photon mode. Moreover, we show that magnon-magnon coupling enhances entanglement between different two modes.</p>

The second is based on the combination of three consecutive measurements and was originally developed to increase the measurement range of the quantum sensor beyond its linear range. After comparing their performances using synthetic data, we implement them on acceleration data collected in a recent airborne campaign and evaluate the bias and the scale factor error of the classical sensor. We then extend their scope to the dynamical evaluation of other key measurement parameters (e.g. alignment errors). We demonstrate an improvement in the correlation between the two accelerometers' measurements and a significant reduction of the error in the estimation of the bias of the classical sensor.</p>

            <p>We present an experimental implementation of the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) no-go theorem on IBM's 156-qubit Heron2 Marrakesh superconducting quantum processor. By preparing qubits in a set of non-orthogonal states and evolving them under carefully compiled unitary circuits, we test whether one can interpret the hidden variable model for quantum states as merely epistemic -- reflecting ignorance about some underlying physical reality. To account for realistic hardware imperfections, we derive noise-aware error tolerance based on decoherence models calibrated to the device's performance. Our results show that a significant majority of adjacent qubit pairs and adjacent five-qubit configurations yield outcome statistics that violate the epistemic bound, thus ruling out the epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we observe a clear trend: the probability of passing the PBR test decreases as the spatial separation within the quantum processor between qubits increases, highlighting the sensitivity of this protocol to connectivity and coherence in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. These results demonstrate the PBR test as a promising device-level benchmark for quantumness in the presence of realistic noise.</p>

            <p>Diamonds containing color centers have recently gathered significant attention for photonic quantum technologies, including quantum sensing, photonic quantum computers, and quantum networks. Among the various color centers, tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are particularly promising due to the high emission efficiency from the zero-phonon line and due to their long spin coherence times. However, the extraction of photons from diamond remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate high photon extraction from a single SnV center incorporated in a diamond nanopillar with tapered sidewalls and a multi-cone structure. A sharp emission peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $6\,$nm was observed at a wavelength of $619\,$nm. Furthermore, the second-order correlation function exhibited an antibunching dip well below $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.5$, indicating single-photon emission. Remarkably, the emitter achieved a high saturation count rate of approximately $9\,$Mcps. These results establish our nanopillar platform as a promising candidate for bright and stable quantum sources and sensors based on SnV centers in diamond.</p>

            <p>Strongly correlated photons play a crucial role in modern quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the probability of generating strongly correlated photons in a chain of N qubits coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide. We found that disorder in the transition frequencies can induce photon antibunching, and especially nearly perfect photon blockade events in the transmission and reflection outputs. As a comparison, in ordered chains, strongly correlated photons cannot be generated in the transmission output, and only weakly antibunched photons are found in the reflection output. The occurrence of nearly perfect photon blockade events stems from the disorder-induced near completely destructive interference of photon scattering paths. Our work highlights the impact of disorder on photon correlation generation and suggests that disorder can enhance the potential for achieving strongly correlated photon.</p>

            <p>Quantum memories are essential components of quantum networks, enabling synchronization, quantum repeaters, and long-distance entanglement distribution. Most ensemble-based realizations rely on dark-state polaritons (DSPs) in $\Lambda$-type systems that operate at near-infrared wavelengths, such as 795 nm in $^{87}$Rb, far from the telecom band where long fiber transmission is optimal. Here we identify a DSP in $^{87}$Rb that coherently couples two photonic modes at 795 nm and 1324 nm through a shared spin-wave coherence. We derive its field operator and group velocity, extending the Fleischhauer-Lukin model to a dual-wavelength regime, and formulate a memory protocol enabling bidirectional storage and retrieval between the two modes. Numerical simulations of the full six-level dynamics confirm two-way storage and retrieval for both same-mode and cross-mode operation between the two wavelengths. The results demonstrate a dual-wavelength memory that unifies node-band and telecom-band operation within a single ensemble, providing a potential route toward frequency-conversion-free quantum-network interfaces.</p>

            <p>Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces of nature. However, high-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is notoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation offers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly probed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and long-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a high-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the initial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to rapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to long distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be explained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma oscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the way to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate a lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma oscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of predictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework encompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of the plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics of a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum simulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of isolated quantum systems following a sudden quench plays a central role in many areas of material science, high-energy physics, and quantum chemistry. Featuring complex phenomena with implications for thermalization, non-equilibrium phase transitions, and Floquet phase engineering, such far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics is challenging to study numerically, in particular, in high-dimensional systems. Here, we use a programmable neutral atom quantum simulator to systematically explore quench dynamics in spin models with up to 180 qubits. By initializing the system in a product state and performing quenches across a broad parameter space, we discover several stable, qualitatively distinct dynamical regimes. We trace their robustness to Floquet-like prethermal steady states that are stabilized over long emergent timescales by strong dynamical constraints. In addition, we observe sharp peaks in the dynamical response that are quantitatively explained by the structured melting of prethermalization through resonances. In two dimensions, we uncover a sharp dynamical response change that converges with increased system size, that is linked to the proliferation of NÃ©el-order defects and indicative of a dynamical phase transition with no equilibrium analogs. Uncovering an intricate interplay between quantum prethermalization and emergent dynamical phases, our results demonstrate the use of quantum simulators for revealing complex non-equilibrium quantum many-body phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Neural PDE Solvers with Physics Constraints: A Comparative Study of PINNs, DRM, and WANs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiakang Chen</p>
            <p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks (WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the study to a laser-driven case of SchrÃ¶dinger's equation via the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation. Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs), forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning, network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case, indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks. We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible, scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.</p>

            <p>Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin qudits offer an attractive platform for quantum memory, combining long coherence times with rich multi-level spin structures. Terbium bis(phthalocyaninato) (TbPc$_2$) exemplifies such systems, with demonstrated quantum control and chemical reproducibility. In hybrid quantum architectures, TbPc$_2$ can act as the primary memory element, with semiconductor qubits providing scalable readout and coupling. Here we present a step toward such a hybrid system: using an industrially manufactured silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) spin qubit to detect electronic spin transitions of an ensemble of TbPc$_2$ molecules. The readout is based on a compact and robust protocol that applies a microwave pulse while all gate voltages defining the qubit are held at a fixed operating point. This protocol, which combines simultaneous Rapid adiabatic Passage and Spin- Selective tunneling (RPSS), enables high-contrast resonance detection and avoids repeated $\pi$-pulse recalibration common in decoupling schemes. By demonstrating ensemble detection, we establish a foundation for integrating molecular quantum memories with industrial qubit platforms and mark an important step toward single-molecule hybrid quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is emerging as a promising tool in nuclear physics. However, the cost of encoding fermionic operators hampers the application of algorithms in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we analyze an encoding scheme based on pairing nucleon modes. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of the encoding, while maintaining a high accuracy for the ground states of semimagic nuclei across the $sd$ and $pf$ shells and for tin isotopes. In addition, we also explore the encoding ability to describe open-shell nuclei within the above configuration spaces. When this scheme is applied to a trotterized quantum adiabatic evolution, our results demonstrate a computational advantage of up to three orders of magnitude in CNOT gate count compared to the standard Jordan-Wigner encoding. Our approach paves the way for efficient quantum simulations of nuclear structure using quantum annealing, with applications to both digital and hybrid quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <h2>Time-diffracting 2D wave vortices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boris A. Khanikati, Konstantin Y. Bliokh</p>
            <p>Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to phase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract in both space and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely in time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, as well as examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices.</p>

            <p>The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar A. M. Abdelraouf</p>
            <p>Integrated and tunable light sources are critical for advancing quantum nanophotonic chips in quantum computing, communications, and sensing. However, efficient and tunable emission amplification post-fabrication poses major challenges. Hybrid metasurfaces combining niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), copper indium sulfide (CIS) quantum dots or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) as a low-loss phase-change material offer a compelling solution for dynamic control and amplification of photoluminescence and quantum light emission. In this work, we report an active hybrid metasurface supporting tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances in the visible regime, achieving experimental Q-factors up to 206 and strong amplification of CIS QDs photoluminescence as well as quantum light emission of hBN single-photon emitters. The metasurface enables BIC resonance shifts of 33.5 nm in the visible spectrum via phase transition of Sb2S3, and 17 nm through dimensional parametric tuning. We experimentally demonstrate highly directional photoluminescence amplification up to 33-fold, alongside broad tunable amplified PL emission upon Sb2S3 phase modulation. Furthermore, we propose amplified, tunable, and on-demand strong coupling of hBN single-photon emitters with the tunable BIC metasurface for next-generation broadband quantum nanophotonic chips. This work sets a new benchmark in reconfigurable nanophotonic platforms for efficient quantum light sources in integrated photonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ines Safi</p>
            <p>We derive a novel fluctuation--dissipation theorem (FDT) valid for nonequilibrium initial states that imprint the braiding of anyons in the time domain. The derivation is carried out within the Unifying Nonequilibrium Perturbative Theory (UNEPT), which applies to both standard reservoir geometries and configurations with one or two quantum point contacts (QPCs) injecting dilute anyonic fluxes. Based on this FDT, we propose complementary methods to determine the time-domain braiding phase. The first method relates the DC backscattering noise to the integral of the current with respect to DC drives, while the second connects the AC current phase shift to the DC noise. The latter provides a particularly robust probe of the statistical angle $\theta$, offering an intrinsic calibration and cancelling certain nonuniversal renormalization effects. Specializing to a thermalized Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL), we further show that in the quantum regime the phase shift enables a direct determination of the scaling dimension $\delta$ when $\delta > 1/2$. These results define experimentally accessible schemes to extract either $\theta$ or $\delta$ in minimal single-QPC setups, without relying on interferometry or cross-correlation measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Sun, Syed A. Jafar</p>
            <p>A distributed quantum storage code maps a quantum message to N storage nodes, of arbitrary specified sizes, such that the stored message is robust to an arbitrary specified set of erasure patterns. The sizes of the storage nodes, and erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed quantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative to the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message and all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the decoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized for various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and intersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a classical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize non-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the corresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly non-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information inequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum entropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs.</p>

            <p>We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Partha Nandi, Partha Ghose, Francesco Petruccione</p>
            <p>Spin networks in loop quantum gravity provide a kinematical picture of quantum geometry but lack a natural mechanism for dynamical Dirac-type evolution, while the Wheeler--DeWitt equation typically enters only as an imposed constraint. We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.</p>

            <p>The observation of gravitational waves has opened a new window into the Universe through gravitational-wave astronomy. However, high-frequency gravitational waves remain undetected. In this work, we propose that spin systems can be employed to detect gravitational waves in this unexplored frequency regime.

We focus on nuclear spins and utilize nuclear magnetic resonance to enhance the gravitational response, leveraging the advantages of long coherence time, high polarization, and a small gyromagnetic ratio. The proposed experimental scheme is capable of probing gravitational waves in the kilohertz to gigahertz range, with projected sensitivities reaching $\sqrt{S_h}\approx10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mainak Dutta, Partha Nandi, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi</p>
            <p>A central challenge in probing the quantum nature of gravity is to distinguish effects that are genuinely quantum from those that can be explained classically. In this work, we study how quantized gravitational waves interact with thermal quantum systems, modeled as harmonic oscillators. We show that, unlike classical waves, quantized gravitons generate entanglement and leave behind a persistent ``graviton-induced quantum memory'' even after the wave has passed. This effect is further shaped by the presence of thermal noise, which does not simply wash out quantum correlations but can in fact amplify them in distinctive ways. Our analysis reveals clear signatures - such as nonlinear thermal corrections and a prethermal time-crystal-like phase-that cannot arise from any classical treatment. These results identify experimentally relevant markers of gravitons and provide a framework for exploring how finite-temperature environments may help uncover the quantum nature of gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matic Orel, Marko Robnik</p>
            <p>We investigate eigenstate localization in the phase space of the Bunimovich mushroom billiard, a paradigmatic mixed-phase-space system whose piecewise-$C^{1}$ boundary yields a single clean separatrix between one regular and one chaotic region. By varying the stem half-width $w$, we continuously change the strength and extent of bouncing-ball stickiness in the stem, which for narrow stems gives rise to phase space localization of chaotic eigenstates. Using the PoincarÃ©-Husimi (PH) representation of eigenstates we quantify localization via information entropies and inverse participation ratios of PH functions. For sufficiently wide stems the distribution of entropy localization measures converges to a two-parameter beta distribution, while entropy localization measures and inverse participation ratios across the chaotic ensemble exhibit an approximately linear relationship. Finally, the fraction of mixed (neither purely regular nor fully chaotic) eigenstates decays as a power-law in the effective semiclassical parameter, in precise agreement with the Principle of Uniform Semiclassical Condensation of Wigner functions (PUSC).</p>

The graph based structure is machine-friendly and supports powerful pattern matching based compilation techniques. Inspired by MLIR, HUGR's extensibility further allows compilation tooling to reason about programs at multiple levels of abstraction, lowering smoothly between them. Safety guarantees in the structure including strict, static typing and linear quantum types allow rapid development of compilation tooling without fear of program invalidation.

In this work, we introduce a universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space. Building on this lifting, we obtain a \emph{parity-graded representation} of fermionic wavefunctions, expressed in terms of symmetric feature variables that encode particle configuration and antisymmetric feature variables that encode exchange statistics. This representation is both exact and minimal: the number of required features scales as $D\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\sim N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network solvers for many-electron systems.</p>

            <p>A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra- and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 136 $\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.</p>

            <p>The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics to study strongly correlated effects. However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.</p>

            <p>We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.</p>

            <p>Communication over a quantum multiple-access channel (MAC) with cribbing encoders is considered, whereby Transmitter 2 performs a measurement on a system that is entangled with Transmitter 1. Based on the no-cloning theorem, perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios, Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2's cribbing may inflict a "state collapse" for Transmitter 1. Achievable regions are derived for each setting. Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the channel input. Building on the analogy between the noisy cribbing model and the relay channel, a partial decode-forward region is derived for a quantum MAC with non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum MAC with cribbing encoders, the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input, and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing. In the special case of a classical-quantum MAC with a deterministic cribbing channel, the inner and outer bounds coincide.</p>

It guarantees that a class of attacks on quantum protocols, based on eavesdropping and indiscriminate copying of quantum information, are impossible. Due to its fundamental importance, it is natural to ask whether it is an intrinsic quantum property or whether it also holds for a broader class of non-classical theories. To address this question, one could use the framework of correlation scenarios. Under this standpoint, Joshi, Grudka, and Horodecki$^{\otimes 4}$ conjectured that one cannot locally broadcast nonlocal behaviours. In this paper, we prove their conjecture based on the monotonicity of the relative entropy for behaviours. Additionally, following a similar reasoning, we obtain an analogous no-go theorem for steerable assemblages.</p>

All the local quantum state discrimination premises, considered so far, mimic a basic communication set-up, where the spatially separated decoding devices are independent of any additional input. Here, exploring a generalized communication scenario, we introduce a framework for input-dependent local quantum state discrimination, which we call local random authentication (LRA). We report that impossibility of LRA certifies the presence of entangled states in the ensemble, a feature absent from erstwhile nonlocality arguments based on local state discrimination. Additionally, we explore the salient features of this state discrimination prototype for arbitrary set of orthogonal quantum states and compare them with the traditional notion of local quantum state discrimination. Finally, our results reveal a fundamental information-theoretic implications in the local estimation of quantum change point problems.</p>

In this paper, we propose a new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results: 1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination. Here, the sample complexity is measured given sample access to the quantum state to be tested, while the query complexity is measured given query access to an oracle that block-encodes the quantum state. 2. A matching lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by GilyÃ©n, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal. 3. A new lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023). 4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015, Comm. Math. Phys. 2021). In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.</p>

This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</p>

            <h2>The discrete adiabatic quantum linear system solver has lower constant factors than the randomized adiabatic solver</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro C.S. Costa, Dong An, Ryan Babbush, Dominic Berry</p>
            <p>The solution of linear systems of equations is the basis of many other quantum algorithms, and recent results provided an algorithm with optimal scaling in both the condition number $\kappa$ and the allowable error $\epsilon$ [PRX Quantum \textbf{3}, 040303 (2022)]. That work was based on the discrete adiabatic theorem, and worked out an explicit constant factor for an upper bound on the complexity. Here we show via numerical testing on random matrices that the constant factor is in practice about 1,200 times smaller than the upper bound found numerically in the previous results. That means that this approach is far more efficient than might naively be expected from the upper bound. In particular, it is about an order of magnitude more efficient than using a randomised approach from [arXiv:2305.11352] that claimed to be more efficient.</p>

            <h2>Error Correction in Dynamical Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esther Xiaozhen Fu, Daniel Gottesman</p>
            <p>We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.</p>

            <h2>Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Yang</p>
            <p>Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.</p>

            <h2>Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Srivastav, Vivek Pandey, Brij Mohan, Arun Kumar Pati</p>
            <p>Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space are generally unattainable for a wide class of dynamics and it is difficult to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we present two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty relations for operators acting on Liouville space, and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. We also obtain the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal CPTP dynamics that connect the given initial and target states. To illustrate our findings, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. In another important application, we show that our results can help us understand the counter-intuitive phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics, as the minimal relaxation time scale obtained by speed limits is dictated by the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a novel authenticated Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol employing maximally entangled qubit pairs. In the absence of noise, we securely authenticate the well-known BB84 QKD scheme under two assumptions: first, adversaries cannot simultaneously access preshared and non-pre-shared secret classical information, and second, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre-shared secret classical information and quantum memories held by legitimate parties. The main strength of this noiseless result is that access to all secretly pre-shared classical information is insufficient for breaching our scheme. Additionally, our protocol desirably allows for pre-shared secrecy reusage, leading to secret key growing. In order to address noise, we simulate a photonic implementation of our scheme, together with a storage model that aims to replicate the performance of cavity-enhanced Atomic- Frequency Comb (AFC) memories. Two methods are used to distinguish authentic entities from forgery attempts: on the one hand, a statistical approach is used after calibration of its defining parameter $\mu$. Alternatively, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is designed and trained to learn the underlying different structure of that input data coming from adversaries in comparison to that one coming from legitimate parties. Both methods achieve a correct classification rate larger than 0.80 for memory storage time of 150 $\mu$s and a 1 km distance between parties.</p>

            <p>Tomographic locality is a principle commonly used in the program of finding axioms that pick out quantum theory within the landscape of possible theories. The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory -- which can be classical, quantum or post-quantum -- and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to the collective action of that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds. We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic nonlocality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks can enhance both security and privacy conditions for multi-user communication, delegated computation, and distributed sensing tasks. An example quantum protocol is private parameter estimation (PPE) where only the aggregate information is accessible while individual sensor data remain confidential. Specifically, the protocol enables the estimation of a global function of remote sensor parameters without revealing local parameters to any entity. We implement the PPE protocol by distributing a three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, among three sensors, which is verified using stabilizer measurements to establish privacy and precision bounds for the sensing task. We demonstrate Heisenberg-limited precision scaling of the global parameter while suppressing the metrological information of the local parameters by up to three orders of magnitude. This work, which integrates privacy in distributed quantum sensing, marks a crucial step towards developing advanced quantum-secure-and-private protocols in complex quantum networks.</p>

We first describe the principle of the algorithm from a theoretical point of view. We provide a detailed pseudo-code of the algorithm, on which we elaborate preliminary elements for a complexity analysis to highlight some of its scaling properties. We apply our algorithm to a set of examples, running on emulators and real hardware showcasing its applicability across diverse sets of differential equations.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> AndrÃ¡s Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo</p>
            <p>We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).</p>

            <h2>Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the lower bound on the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the lower bound on the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive fundamental precision limits, dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectations of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are set by quantities such as dimensions and energy bandwidth, which depend only on the initial configuration and are independent of the dynamics. Using a quantum battery model, the fundamental precision limits show that there is a trade-off between the amount of energy storage and the charging precision. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental limits, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can improve the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.</p>

            <p>TThe organization and structure of bipartite mixed-state quantum entanglement (QE) are more complex and less well understood compared to bipartite pure-state QE. Bipartite mixed-state QEs and their measures play a crucial role in both theory and practical applications. Some existing measures involve quantifying the minimum QE and reflect the inherently complex nature of their computation, while others are only applicable to highly limited-dimensional quantum systems. In this context, we propose a method termed Reduction-induced Variation of Partial Von Neumann Entropy to quantify QE in any bipartite states, particularly focusing on bipartite mixed states. Partial Von Neumann Entropy is merely a special case of this method,Its intuitive and clear physical representation, along with easy computation and wide applicability, facilitates exploring its potential applications. Furthermore, we present examples to demonstrate the superiorities of this method in identifying bipartite QE by comparing with other existing bipartite mixed-state QE measures through both their physical implications and mathematical structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qile Su, Rodrigo G. CortiÃ±as, Jayameenakshi Venkatraman, Shruti Puri</p>
            <p>The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily with the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator), whose energy barrier can be increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a step-like decrease termed the "staircase". The view challenged by the experiment demands a deep review of our understanding of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical formula for the switching rate that resolves a continuous transition between tunneling- and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat and the steep parts of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: dephasing and decay. This allows us to predict the critical drive amplitudes where steps occur. In addition, we show that in the regime of a few states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, however, the perturbation induced by the nonhermitian Hamiltonian becomes important and facilitates a new form of quantum heating. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</p>

            <p>A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d>4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0<\alpha<3d/2$. For $\alpha<d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d<\alpha<d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s>4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.</p>

In our scheme, not only the direction and types of the bipartite steering, but also different situations of multipartite steering, can be manipulated effectively, by adjusting the pump proportions with a spatial light modulator. In addition, stricter genuine pentapartite steering (only one site is trusted) can also be achieved by making the pump proportions as balanced as possible. Our scheme is versatile and experimentally feasible and offers new insights into the manipulation of steering, especially multipartite steering, which is valuable in many special quantum tasks.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum function secret sharing scheme in which the communication is exclusively classical. In this primitive, a classical dealer distributes a secret quantum circuit $C$ by providing shares to $p$ quantum parties. The parties on an input state $\ket{\psi}$ and a projection $\Pi$, compute values $y_i$ that they then classically communicate back to the dealer, who can then compute $\lVert \Pi C|\psi\rangle\rVert^2$ using only classical resources. Moreover, the shares do not leak much information about the secret circuit $C$. Our protocol for quantum secret sharing uses the {\em Cayley path}, a tool that has been extensively used to support quantum primacy claims. More concretely, the shares of $C$ correspond to randomized version of $C$ which are delegated to the quantum parties, and the reconstruction can be done by extrapolation. Our scheme has two limitations, which we prove to be inherent to our techniques: First, our scheme is only secure against single adversaries, and we show that if two parties collude, then they can break its security. Second, the evaluation done by the parties requires exponential time in the number of gates.</p>

This paper reviews the current status of the Measurement Problem, distinguishing between what is well understood and what remains unresolved. We examine key theoretical approaches, including decoherence, many-worlds interpretation, objective collapse theories, hidden-variable theories, dualistic approaches, deterministic models, and epistemic interpretations.

[Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)], replacing the use of classical shadows. While the original QC-AFQMC showed high accuracy for quantum chemistry calculations, it required exponentially costly post-processing. Subsequent work using Matchgate shadows [Commun. Math. Phys. 404, 629 (2023)] improved scalability, but still suffers from prohibitive computational requirements that limit practical applications. Our QC-CBT-AFQMC approach uses shallow Clifford circuits with a quadratic reduction of two-qubit gates over the original algorithm, significantly reducing computational requirements and enabling accurate calculations under limited measurement budgets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and nitrogen molecule, producing potential energy curves that closely match established benchmarks. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques.

            <p>Trapped-ion systems are a leading platform for quantum computing. The MÃ¸lmer-SÃ¸rensen (MS) gate is a widely used method for implementing controlled interactions in multipartite systems. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the environment, quantum states undergo non-unitary evolution, leading to significant deviations from ideal dynamics. Common techniques such as Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) and Bell State Tomography (BST) are typically employed to evaluate MS gate performance and to characterize noise in the system. In this letter, we propose leveraging the geometric phase as a tool for performance assessment and noise identification in the MS gate. Our findings indicate that the geometric phase is particularly sensitive to environmental noise occurring around twice the clock pulse time. Given that geometric phase measurements do not require full-state tomography, this approach offers a practical and experimentally feasible method to detect entanglement and classify the nature of noise affecting the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. B. Horoshko, V. S. Shchesnovich</p>
            <p>Optical downconversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a non-depleted and non-entangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation of the downconversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. The new model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of $r\approx 1.8$ and a coherent pump amplitude of $\alpha\approx 2\cdot10^6$, can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of $\alpha \approx 2\cdot10^6$, the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds $r\approx 4.5$, whereas the new approximation remains valid up to $r\approx 6$ with an acceptable error of 1%.</p>

            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme in a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, where a mechanical resonator couples to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through diagonalization of the full system's transition matrix in the Heisenberg picture. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the framework of open quantum system. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unsteady system states. Remarkably, the squeezing level can exceed the maximum achievable under system stability conditions. Furthermore, we show that our protocol is robust against systematic errors in both driving intensity and frequency, as well as against thermal Markovian noises. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <h2>QAMA: Scalable Quantum Annealing Multi-Head Attention Operator for Deep Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Du, Jinjing Shi, Wenxuan Wang, Yin Ma, Kai Wen, Xuelong Li</p>
            <p>Attention mechanisms underpin modern deep learning, while the quadratic time and space complexity limit scalability for long sequences. To address this, Quantum Annealing Multi-Head Attention (QAMA) is proposed, a novel drop-in operator that reformulates attention as an energy-based Hamiltonian optimization problem. In this framework, token interactions are encoded into binary quadratic terms, and quantum annealing is employed to search for low-energy configurations that correspond to effective attention patterns. Unlike classical sparse or approximate attention methods that rely on hand-crafted heuristics, QAMA allows sparsity structures to emerge naturally from the optimization process. Theoretically, computational complexity is analysed through single-spin flip dynamics, providing time to solution runtime bounds that depend on the spectral properties of the annealing Hamiltonian. Empirically, evaluation on both natural language and vision benchmarks shows that, across tasks, accuracy deviates by at most 2.7 points from standard multi-head attention, while requiring only linear qubits in sequence length. Visualizations further reveal that the Hamiltonian penalty terms induce meaningful and interpretable sparsity across heads. Finally, deployment on a coherent Ising machine validates the feasibility of running QAMA on real quantum hardware, showing tangible inference-time reductions compared with classical implementations. These results highlight QAMA as a pioneering and scalable step toward integrating quantum optimization devices into deep neural architectures, providing a seamlessly integrable and hardware-compatible alternative to conventional attention mechanisms.

            <h2>Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining an optimal characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric RÃ©nyi and Petz RÃ©nyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.</p>

            <p>The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [q-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning, Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Cornelissen, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang, QTML 2025]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We demonstrate that the worst case guarantees of these algorithms can significantly improve upon the bounds for algorithms in prior work. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcello Caleffi, Laura d'Avossa, Xu Han, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti</p>
            <p>The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. For communication at distances beyond a few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as a quantum transducer, capable of converting one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide the reader with a tutorial overview of the fundamental research challenges underlying quantum transduction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this tutorial is the first work addressing quantum transduction from a communications engineering perspective, highlighting its fundamental role within quantum network design and deployment. This analysis reveals that there exist different transduction modalities, including an unorthodox one allowing a transducer to act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in communication performance. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Teleportation in Non-equilibrium Environments and Fixed-point Fidelity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaokun Yan, Zhihai Wang, Kun Zhang, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation, a fundamental protocol in quantum information science, enables the transfer of quantum states through entangled particle pairs and classical communication channels. While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in non-equilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We apply the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics. In both bosonic and fermionic setups, the fidelity can be enhanced beyond the equilibrium values. Under specific non-equilibrium conditions, the fidelities of all input states are identical. We call it teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Notably, at the fixed-point, fidelity can also be enhanced by combining the two detuned qubits and non-equilibrium environments. These findings provide important guidance for implementing quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, while the fixed-point mechanism offers a promising pathway toward simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darya Martyniuk, Johannes Jung, Daniel Barta, Adrian Paschke</p>
            <p>The development of quantum algorithms and their practical applications currently relies heavily on the efficient design, compilation, and optimization of quantum circuits. In particular, parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), which serve as the basis for variational quantum algorithms~(VQAs), demand carefully engineered architectures that balance performance with hardware constraints. Despite recent progress, identifying structural features of PQCs that enhance trainability, noise resilience, and overall algorithmic performance remains an active area of research. Addressing these challenges, quantum architecture search (QAS) aims to automate the design of problem-specific PQCs by systematically exploring circuit architectures to optimize algorithmic performance, often with varying degrees of consideration for hardware constraints. However, comparing QAS methods is challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark evaluation pipeline, and the high resource demands. In this paper, we present SQuASH, the Surrogate Quantum Architecture Search Helper, a benchmark that leverages surrogate models to enable uniform comparison of QAS methods and considerably accelerate their evaluation. We present the methodology for creating a surrogate benchmark for QAS and demonstrate its capability to accelerate the execution and comparison of QAS methods. Additionally, we provide the code required to integrate SQuASH into custom QAS methods, enabling not only benchmarking but also the use of surrogate models for rapid prototyping. We further release the dataset used to train the surrogate models, facilitating reproducibility and further research.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Power Superbroadening of Spectral Line Profiles on IBM Quantum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov</p>
            <p>Power broadening refers to the widening of the spectral line profile in a two-state quantum transition as the strength of the driving field increases. This phenomenon commonly arises in continuous-wave driving when the radiation field's intensity exceeds the transition's saturation intensity and it has been extensively studied in spectroscopy. For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral response of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a rectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth shapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic for the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 020802 (2024)], in a dramatic paradigm shift, we have demonstrated experimentally that for Lorentzian-shaped pulses, the opposite effect - power narrowing - takes place: the width of the spectral profile decreases when the driving pulse amplitude increases, with a narrowing factor of as much as 10 observed. While in high-resolution spectroscopy the push is for eliminating or even inverting the power broadening, there are applications where it is used to an advantage for it facilitates off-resonance excitation. Here, we present a number of shaped pulses that exhibit power broadening much greater than that of the rectangular pulse of the same pulse area. They are grouped in two families of pulse shapes. In particular, in regard to the width of the second Rabi oscillation maximum, the quadratic pulse family shows an increase by a factor of 3.3 whereas the even-exponent pulse family exhibits an increase by a factor of more than 3.5.</p>

            <h2>The Quantum Paldus Transform: Efficient Circuits with Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JÄdrzej Burkat, Nathan Fitzpatrick</p>
            <p>We present the Quantum Paldus Transform: an efficient quantum algorithm for block-diagonalising fermionic, spin-free Hamiltonians in the second quantisation. Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin (GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \times SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities we provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods with full gate counts for the Paldus transform, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, where a transform on $50$ spatial orbitals would require a modest $5500$ Toffoli gates. This paves the way for significant advancements in quantum simulation on quantum computers enabled by the UGA paradigm.</p>

            <p>We explore covert entanglement generation over the lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, which is a quantum-mechanical model of many practical settings, including optical, microwave, and radio-frequency (RF) channels. Covert communication ensures that an adversary is unable to detect the presence of transmissions, which are concealed in channel noise. We show that a square root law (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical communication: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more practical for physical implementation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing Yao Mi, Yong-Chun Liu, Zhi Jiao Deng, Chun Wang Wu, Ping Xing Chen</p>
            <p>Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Furthermore, a concrete experimental proposal based on the trapped-ion setup is provided.</p>

            <p>Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.</p>

            <p>A microwave-optical transducer of sufficiently low noise and high signal transfer rate would allow entanglement to be distributed between superconducting quantum processors at a rate faster than the lifetimes of the quantum memories being linked. Here we present measurements of a membrane-based opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a quantum network with reasonable averaging times.</p>

            <p>Compiling quantum circuits to account for hardware restrictions is an essential part of the quantum computing stack. Circuit compilation allows us to adapt algorithm descriptions into a sequence of operations supported by real quantum hardware, and has the potential to significantly improve their performance when optimization techniques are added to the process. One such optimization technique is reducing the number of quantum gates that are needed to execute a circuit. For instance, methods for reducing the number of non-Clifford gates or CNOT gates from a circuit is an extensive research area that has gathered significant interest over the years. For certain hardware platforms such as ion trap quantum computers, we can leverage some of their special properties to further reduce the cost of executing a quantum circuit in them. In this work we use global interactions, such as the Global MÃ¸lmer-SÃ¸rensen gate present in ion trap hardware, to optimize and synthesize quantum circuits. We design and implement an algorithm that is able to compile an arbitrary quantum circuit into another circuit that uses global gates as the entangling operation, while optimizing the number of global interactions needed. The algorithm is based on the ZX-calculus and uses an specialized circuit extraction routine that groups entangling gates into Global MÃ¸lmer-SÃ¸rensen gates. We benchmark the algorithm in a variety of circuits, and show how it improves their performance under state-of-the-art hardware considerations in comparison to a naive algorithm and the Qiskit optimizer.</p>

            <p>Unitary randomness underpins both fundamental tasks in quantum information and the modern theory of quantum chaos. On one side, a central concept is that of approximate unitary designs: circuits that look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. In a distinct setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), intensely studied as a measure of information scrambling, have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the noncommutative generalization of statistical independence. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables, while traceless observables instead require exponential resources. Indeed, local observables are precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, adding to previous literature, we show how random matrix product unitaries constitute approximate designs: we exactly compute the frame potential of the ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value with polynomial deviations and so indicating that global observables are freely independent on-average. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage and shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip A. LeMaitre</p>
            <p>Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</p>

            <p>Quantum databases open an exciting new frontier in data management by offering privacy guarantees that classical systems cannot match. Traditional engines tackle user privacy, which hides the records being queried, or data privacy, which prevents a user from learning more than she has queried. We propose a quantum database that protects both by leveraging quantum mechanics: when the user measures her chosen basis, the superposition collapses and the unqueried rows become physically inaccessible. We encode relational tables as a sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single, destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple. This allows us to preserve data privacy and user privacy at once without trusted hardware or heavyweight cryptography. Moreover, we envision a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture ready for early deployment, which ensures compatibility with the limitations of today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.</p>

Most of these new algorithms are inspired from previous classical ones, but with different pros and cons. In this Letter, we focus on the generalization of the variational principle for many-body excited-states that led to the ensemble variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We compare the performance of two ensemble VQE approaches, the equi-ensemble and weighted-ensemble ones, and conclude that the equi-ensemble is the way to go.</p>

The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center magnetometry is a highly promising quantum sensing technology, with early prototypes demonstrating impressive sensitivity in compact sensing heads. Yet, most existing implementations remain tied to laboratory setups, lacking the portability and environmental robustness needed to unlock their full potential in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a fully portable, hand-held NV-based magnetometer that delivers a vector sensitivity of approximately 400 pT/sqrt(Hz), heading errors below 5 nT in Earth's field, and a wide signal bandwidth that supports on-field recalibration and operation on moving platforms. We further demonstrate the system's technological maturity through environmental qualification such as thermal, vibration, radiation and other operational stresses related to deployment in low Earth orbit, and through successful deployments in demanding scenarios, including northern Canadian weather conditions, drone-mounted surveys and high-altitude balloon flights. Together, these achievements establish this NV-based magnetometer as a robust, versatile tool ready to bring quantum sensing performance to a broad range of field and autonomous applications.</p>

            <h2>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lane P. Hughston, Levent A. MengÃ¼tÃ¼rk</p>
            <p>We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization. We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</p>

            <p>Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.</p>

            <p>Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2 times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The lack of self-correcting codes hiders the development of boson sampling to be large-scale and robust. Therefore, it is important to know the noise levels in order to cautiously demonstrate the quantum computational advantage or realize certain tasks. Based on those statistical benchmark methods such as the correlators and the clouds, which are initially proposed to discriminate boson sampling and other mockups, we quantificationally evaluate noises of photon partial distinguishability and photon loss compensated by dark counts. This is feasible owing to the fact that the output distribution unbalances are suppressed by noises, which are actually results of multi-photon interferences. This is why the evaluation performance is better when high order correlators or corresponding clouds are employed. Our results indicate that the statistical benchmark methods can also work in the task of evaluating noises of boson sampling.</p>

            <p>Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</p>

            <p>In a recent publication, Dalen, and SelstÃ¸, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 111}, 033116 (2025), it was demonstrated how converged photo electron spectra could be determined using a complex absorbing potential on a truncated numerical domain considerably smaller than the extension of the dynamical wave function. That approach required simulation until virtually all unbound parts of the wave function was absorbed, far beyond the duration of the interaction with the external field. In this work we formulate the method in a semi-analytical manner which allows us to extrapolate to infinite times after the interaction with the external field. In addition to obtaining photoelectron spectra for hydrogen differential in energy and ejection angle, we also demonstrate how -- and when -- the absorber may be seen as a detector, distorting the angular distributions when the detector is placed in the extreme vicinity of the atom.</p>

            <p>Quantum blockchains provide inherent resilience against quantum adversaries and represent a promising alternative to classical blockchain systems in the quantum era. However, existing quantum blockchain architectures largely depend on entanglement to maintain inter-block connections, facing challenges in stability, consensus efficiency, and system verification. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel quantum blockchain framework based on quantum walks, which reduces reliance on entanglement while improving stability and connection efficiency. We further propose a quantum consensus mechanism based on a weighted quantum voting protocol, which enables a fairer voting process while reflecting the weights of different nodes. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct circuit simulations to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of both the quantum walk-based block construction and the quantum voting consensus mechanism. Compared with existing entanglement-dependent approaches, our framework achieves stronger stability and enables simpler verification of block integrity, making it a practical candidate for quantum-era blockchain applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Lake</p>
            <p>We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <h2>Emergent continuous symmetry and ground-state factorization induced by long-range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Yu, Myung-Joong Hwang</p>
            <p>The spontaneous breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry typically gives rise to emergent excitations possessing the same symmetry with a renormalized mass. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we present a theory in which the low-lying excitation in the broken-symmetry phase acquires a continuous symmetry, even when the underlying symmetry of the system is discrete. In the presence of anisotropic long-range interactions, the order parameter renormalizes the relative strength of the particle-conserving and particle-nonconserving interactions. When one of the two renormalized interactions vanishes, a conservation law absent in the original Hamiltonian emerges, giving rise to a continuous symmetry. A striking consequence of the emergent continuous symmetry and conservation law is that it constrains quantum correlations in the ground-state to be zero, leading to the ground-state factorization in the presence of strong interactions. Our finding is a universal feature of quantum phase transitions in fully-connected systems and in their lattice generalizations; therefore, it can be observed in a wide range of physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k-Designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Laracuente</p>
            <p>A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1/logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1/nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.</p>

Furthermore, we show the Log-rank Conjecture holds for any non-trivial total permutation-invariant Boolean function. Moreover, we establish a relationship between the quantum/classical communication complexity and the approximate rank of permutation-invariant Boolean functions. This implies the correctness of the Log-approximate-rank Conjecture for permutation-invariant Boolean functions in both randomized and quantum settings (up to a logarithmic factor).</p>

            <p>We present a practical, ab initio time-dependent method using Hagedorn wavepackets to efficiently simulate single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra of polyatomic molecules from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. We apply the method to compute SVL spectra of anthracene by performing wavepacket dynamics on a 66-dimensional harmonic potential energy surface constructed from density functional theory calculations. The Hagedorn approach captures both mode distortion (frequency changes) and mode mixing (Duschinsky rotation) within the harmonic approximation. We not only reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^1$ and $\overline{11}^1$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments. Notably, all spectra were obtained from the same wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for the emission spectrum from the ground vibrational level of the electronically excited state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Cheng, Tao Han, Matthew Low</p>
            <p>A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</p>

            <p>Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics yields exact single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra in global harmonic models. To partially describe the effects of anharmonicity, important in the spectra of real molecules, we describe a combination of the Hagedorn wavepacket approach to SVL spectroscopy with the local harmonic approximation. In a proof-of-principle study [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010801 (2025)], we successfully demonstrated the utility of this method by computing the SVL spectra of difluorocarbene, a floppy molecule with moderately anharmonic potential. Here, we describe the theory in detail and analyse the method more thoroughly. To assess the accuracy of the method independently of electronic structure errors, we use a two-dimensional Morse-type potential for which exact quantum benchmarks are available, and show that the local harmonic approach yields more accurate results than global harmonic approximations, especially for the emission spectra from higher initial vibrational levels. Next, we compare the global and local harmonic SVL spectra of anthracene, where the more expensive local harmonic corrections turn out to be less important as long as the correct global harmonic model is used. We also present additional local harmonic results for difluorocarbene, where treating anharmonicity is essential for accurate evaluation of the spectra. Yet, we also show that the structure of the difluorocarbene spectra can be explained qualitatively (but not quantitatively) with a reduced-dimensional harmonic model, for which the spectral intensities can be evaluated analytically.</p>

We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation. Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by reexamining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</p>

            <p>Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansÃ¤tze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions are able to extract accurate information about quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p>The SchrÃ¶dingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of SchrÃ¶dinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a SchrÃ¶dinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, SchrÃ¶dingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the SchrÃ¶dingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</p>

            <p>Quantum correlations in the polarization degrees of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\Delta\hat\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample -- based on a total of $3 \times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\Delta\hat\Phi$.

The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> AneÅ¾ka DostÃ¡lovÃ¡, Dominik VaÅ¡inka, Robert StÃ¡rek, Miroslav JeÅ¾ek</p>
            <p>Molecular fluorescence microscopy is a leading approach to super-resolution and nanoscale imaging in life and material sciences. However, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is often bottlenecked by system-specific calibrations and long acquisitions of sparsely blinking molecules. We present a deep-learning approach that reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single diffraction-limited camera frame. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data encompassing a wide range of optical and sample parameters, enabling robust generalization across microscopes and experimental conditions. Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion. By delivering unprecedented details from a single short camera exposure without prior information and calibration, our approach enables plug-and-play super-resolution imaging of fast, dense, or light-sensitive samples on standard wide-field setups.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansÃ¤tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable photonics have rapidly become an invaluable tool for information processing. Light-based computing accelerators are promising for boosting neural network learning and inference and optical interconnects are foreseen as a solution to the information transfer bottleneck in high-performance computing. In this study, we demonstrate the successful programming of a transformation implemented using a reconfigurable photonic circuit with a non-conventional architecture. The core of most photonic processors is an MZI-based architecture that establishes an analytical connection between the controllable parameters and circuit transformation. However, several architectures that are substantially more difficult to program have improved robustness to fabrication defects. We use two algorithms that rely on different initial datasets to reconstruct the circuit model of a complex interferometer, and then program the required unitary transformation. Both methods performed accurate circuit programming with an average fidelity above 98%. Our results provide a strong foundation for the introduction of non-conventional interferometric architectures for photonic information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabiano Feleppa, Gaetano Lambiase, Sunny Vagnozzi</p>
            <p>We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</p>

            <p>Universality in physics describes how disparate systems can exhibit identical low-energy behavior. Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\epsilon(k) = \text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.</p>

            <p>Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has enabled physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented accessibility. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. An intriguing theoretical prediction of a characteristic phenomenon of BECs is anomalous tunneling, whereby low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy regime, and experimentally measure these frequencies using Oqtant. Our results reveal that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs, as well as highlight the potential of cloud-based experiments in quantum-body physics.</p>

            <p>We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian, one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Broadhurst, GergÅ Nemes</p>
            <p>In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sqrt{n}\,z^n$ for $|z|<1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty(2\pi{\rm i}n-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-{\rm e}^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion ${\rm e}^{-u}\sum_{k=0}^\infty P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. At large $k$, these polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x)R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants satisfying $R\exp({\rm i}\,C)=\sqrt{-1/(2+\pi{\rm i})}$.</p>

A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics.

            <h2>Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Pricing Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Xin</p>
            <p>Motivated by Heisenberg's observable-only stance, we replace latent "information" (filtrations, hidden diffusions, state variables) with observable transitions between price states. On a discrete price lattice with a Hilbert-space representation, shift operators and the spectral calculus of the price define observable frequency operators and a translation-invariant convolution generator. Combined with jump operators that encode transition intensities, this yields a completely positive, translation-covariant Lindblad semigroup. Under the risk-neutral condition the framework leads to a nonlocal pricing equation that is diagonal in Fourier space; in the small-mesh diffusive limit its generator converges to the classical Black-Scholes-Merton operator. We do not propose another parametric model. We propose a foundation for model construction that is observable, first-principles, and mathematically natural. Noncommutativity emerges from the observable shift algebra rather than being postulated. The jump-intensity ledger determines tail behavior and short-maturity smiles and implies testable links between extreme-event probabilities and implied-volatility wings. Future directions: (i) multi-asset systems on higher-dimensional lattices with vector shifts and block kernels; (ii) state- or flow-dependent kernels as "financial interactions" leading to nonlinear master equations while preserving linear risk-neutral pricing; (iii) empirical tests of the predicted scaling relations between jump intensities and market extremes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ouyang, Pratik Rath</p>
            <p>Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diyi Liu, Shuchen Zhu, Guang Hao Low, Lin Lin, Chao Yang</p>
            <p>Efficient block encoding of many-body Hamiltonians is a central requirement for quantum algorithms in scientific computing, particularly in the early fault-tolerant era. In this work, we introduce new explicit constructions for block encoding second-quantized Hamiltonians that substantially reduce Clifford+T gate complexity and ancilla overhead. By utilizing a data lookup strategy based on the SWAP architecture for the sparsity oracle $O_C$, and a direct sampling method for the amplitude oracle $O_A$ with SELECT-SWAP architecture, we achieve a T count that scales as $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{L})$ with respect to the number of interaction terms $L$ in general second-quantized Hamiltonians. We also achieve an improved constant factor in the Clifford gate count of our oracle. Furthermore, we design a block encoding that directly targets the $\eta$-particle subspace, thereby reducing the subnormalization factor from $\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$, and improving fault-tolerant efficiency when simulating systems with fixed particle numbers. Building on the block encoding framework developed for general many-body Hamiltonians, we extend our approach to electronic Hamiltonians whose coefficient tensors exhibit translation invariance or possess decaying structures. Our results provide a practical path toward early fault-tolerant quantum simulation of many-body systems, substantially lowering resource overheads compared to previous methods.</p>

The goal is to assess the stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency of commonly used gradient-based, gradient-free, and global optimization strategies within the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum regime. We systematically compare six representative optimizers, BFGS, SLSQP, Nelder-Mead, Powell, COBYLA, and iSOMA,under ideal, stochastic, and decoherence noise models, including phase damping, depolarizing, and thermal relaxation channels. Each optimizer was tested over multiple noise intensities and measurement settings to characterize convergence behavior and sensitivity to noise-induced landscape distortions. The results show that BFGS consistently achieves the most accurate energies with minimal evaluations, maintaining robustness even under moderate decoherence. COBYLA performs well for low-cost approximations, while SLSQP exhibits instability in noisy regimes. Global approaches such as iSOMA show potential but are computationally expensive. These findings provide practical guidance for selecting suitable optimizers in variational quantum simulations, highlighting the importance of noise-aware optimization strategies for reliable and efficient quantum chemistry computations on current hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Heinzel, RenÃ© Sondenheimer</p>
            <p>Gaussian states are an essential building block for various applications in quantum optics and quantum information science, yet the precise relation between their second- and third-order correlation functions remains not fully explored. We discuss connections between these correlation functions by constructing an explicit decomposition formula for arbitrary sixth-order moments of ladder operators for general Gaussian states and demonstrate how the derived relations enable state classification from correlation data alone. Whereas violating these relations certifies non-Gaussianity, satisfying them provides evidence for a Gaussian-state description and allows a direct distinction among non-displaced, non-squeezed, and displaced-squeezed sectors of the Gaussian state space. Further, we show that it is not possible to uniquely extract state parameters solely from correlation-function measurements without prior assumptions about the Gaussian state. Resolving this ambiguity requires additional loss-sensitive information, e.g., measuring the mean intensity or the vacuum overlap of each mode. In particular, we show under which circumstances these measurements can be used to reconstruct a generic Gaussian state.</p>

We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current.

            <p>The realization of strong nonlinear coupling between single photons has been a long-standing goal in quantum optics and quantum information science, promising wide impact applications, such as all-optical deterministic quantum logic and single-photon frequency conversion. Here, we report an experimental observation of the strong coupling between a single-photon and a two-photon Fock state in an ultrastrongly-coupled circuit-QED system. This strong nonlinear interaction is realized by introducing a detuned flux qubit working as an effective coupler between two modes of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The ultrastrong light--matter interaction breaks the excitation number conservation, and an external flux bias breaks the parity conservation. The combined effect of the two enables the strong one--two-photon coupling. Quantum Rabi-like avoided crossing is resolved when tuning the two-photon resonance frequency of the first mode across the single-photon resonance frequency of the second mode. Within this new photonic regime, we observe the thresholdless second harmonic generation for a mean photon number below one. Our results represent a key step towards a new regime of quantum nonlinear optics, where individual photons can deterministically and coherently interact with each other in the absence of any stimulating fields.</p>

            <p>A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigensolutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum are predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a {quantum-criticality-enhanced} effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.</p>

Full quantum state tomography, commonly used for this purpose, is a complicated procedure and yields inconclusive results for strongly mixed states. Certifying non-Gaussianity through directly measurable parameters is a simpler alternative, typically achieved by measuring photon-number probabilities - either directly, using photon-number resolving detectors, or through Hanbury Brown--Twiss type measurements with single-photon detectors. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that optical parametric amplification combined with conventional intensity detectors can effectively replace this approach without the need for photon-number resolution. In our method, we measure the mean photon number and the second-order correlation function for the amplified state. Using it, we successfully certify the non-Gaussianity of a heralded quasi-single-photon state. Since optical parametric amplification is a broadband and multimode process, our method provides a foundation for developing high-dimensional quantum technologies utilizing broadband multimode non-Gaussian states.</p>

            <h2>Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhilong Liu, Wentao Liu, Xiaofang Liu, Jieci Wang</p>
            <p>Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</p>
