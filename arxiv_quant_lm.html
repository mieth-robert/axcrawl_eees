            <h2>Robust Entanglement Dynamics in Driven Open Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aqsa Mushtaq, Chaimae Banouni, Mahboob Ul Haq, S. M. Zangi</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of key quantum correlations - Negativity (NG), Quantum Discord (QD), and Quantum-Memory-Assisted Entropic Uncertainty (QM-EUR) - in a bipartite two-qubit system under the influence of external pulses and various decoherence channels, including amplitude damping (gamma_amp), pure dephasing (gamma_deph), and pulse-induced dephasing (G), while different regimes of inter-qubit coupling (Jzz, Jxx), qubit energy splitting (epsilon), and pulse parameters (A_pulse, beta_pulse) are explored. Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement boosting: Low-volume logical Bell pair preparation for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinichi Sunami, Yutaka Hirano, Toshihide Hinokuma, Hayata Yamasaki</p>
            <p>Distributed architecture is a promising route to scaling fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) beyond the inherent limitations of single processors. For practical implementation of distributed FTQC, logical Bell pair preparation must be designed not only for efficient Bell pair consumption but also for the spacetime volume of the protocol; however, entanglement distillation protocols have primarily focused on minimizing the consumption of Bell pairs, often resulting in protocols that require a substantial number of local operations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations. Guided by this metric, we propose entanglement boosting protocol, which achieves efficient preparation of logical Bell pairs encoded in rotated surface code with LLV reduced by orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. In this protocol, paralleling recent advances in magic state cultivation, we employ soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress the logical error rates of Bell pairs to practical levels in the order of $10^{-10}$ from fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs while all local operations are implementable within a spatial region of a single surface code patch. We also present a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation using high-rate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling arbitrarily low logical error rates while also maintaining physically efficient implementations. These results pave the way for the practical implementation of distributed FTQC, reinforcing the benefits of fast interconnect technologies and serving as a guiding principle for the efficient design of protocols and devices.</p>

            <h2>Optimal propagation distance for maximal biphoton entanglement through the weakly turbulent atmosphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luchang Niu, Saleem Iqbal, Yang Xu, Robert W. Boyd</p>
            <p>Understanding the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of entangled biphoton states is essential for free-space quantum communication protocols. Using the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and the Kolmogorov turbulence model, we derive an analytical expression for the combined density operator of the signal and idler fields generated via SPDC, following propagation through separate turbulent channels. By expressing this density operator in the continuous position basis, we show how the spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, as they transition from being quantum to classical in nature. We further identify a finite range of propagation distances over which the angle-OAM entanglement is maximized, which provides valuable insights for designing free-space quantum communication links operating over several kilometers through the turbulent atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>A New Quantum Secure Time Transfer System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravi Singh Adhikari, Aman Gupta, Anju Rani, Xiaoyu Ai, Robert Malaney</p>
            <p>High-precision clock synchronization is essential for a wide range of network-distributed applications. In the quantum space, these applications include communication, sensing, and positioning. However, current synchronization techniques are vulnerable to attacks, such as intercept-resend attacks, spoofing, and delay attacks. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new quantum secure time transfer (QSTT) system, subsequently used for clock synchronization, that largely negates such attacks. Novel to our system is the optimal use of self-generated quantum keys within the QSTT to information-theoretically secure the maximum amount of timing data; as well as the introduction, within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, of an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption sequence of the remaining timing data. With these enhancements, we argue that our new system represents the most robust implementation of QSTT to date.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Macroscopic Quantum Synchronization in an Ensemble of Two-level Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-huan Yang, Dan-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>Spontaneous macroscopic quantum synchronization is an emergent phenomenon where an ensemble of quantum oscillators achieves global phase coherence through the interplay of interaction and dissipation. To illuminate this phenomenon, we study an ensemble of two-level systems (TLS) and establish its associated nonlinear quantum master equation, for which self-consistent analytical solutions of quantum synchronization can be obtained. The trajectories on the Bloch sphere vividly illustrate how dissipation and interaction drive the system toward a synchronized state. We present a phase diagram for macroscopic synchronization as a function of interaction strength and the gain-to-damping ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate full synchronization and partial synchronization between two groups of TLS with different natural frequencies. This work establishes ensemble of TLS as a remarkable system for understanding spontaneous quantum synchronization.</p>

            <h2>Maximizing the nondemolition nature of a quantum measurement via an adaptive readout protocol</h2>

Hudson, Kohei M. Itoh, Chih Hwan Yang, Andrew S. Dzurak, David N. Jamieson, Martin Nurizzo, Danielle Holmes, Arne Laucht, Andrea Morello</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.</p>

            <h2>Memory-Assisted Nonlocal Interferometer Towards Long-Baseline Telescopes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Wang, Xi-Yu Luo, Bo-Feng Gao, Jian-Long Liu, Chao-Yang Wang, Zi Yan, Qiao-Mu Ke, Da Teng, Ming-Yang Zheng, Yuan Cao, Jun Li, Cheng-Zhi Peng, Qiang Zhang, Xiao-Hui Bao, Jian-Wei Pan</p>
            <p>Quantum networks and remote quantum entanglement serve as vital future quantum communication resources with broad applicability. A key direction lies in extending the baseline of optical interferometers to enhance angular resolution in interferometric imaging. Here, by measuring a simulated thermal light field, we report the demonstration of a memory-assisted nonlocal interferometer achieving a fiber-link baseline up to 20 km while simultaneously showing its capability to compensate for a geometric delay equivalent to 1.5 km. This result demonstrates potential for enhancing the angular resolution of interferometric imaging in the optical band with delocalized single-photon entanglement, and paves the way for future application of quantum memories in astronomical observation.</p>

            <h2>The Riemann Hypothesis Emerges in Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ShiJie Wei, Yue Zhai, Quanfeng Lu, Wentao Yang, Pan Gao, Chao Wei, Junda Song, Franco Nori, Tao Xin, GuiLu Long</p>
            <p>The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast quantum gates with fully quantized free-electron quantum optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongcheng Ding</p>
            <p>Free-electron quantum optics provides a versatile platform for manipulating electrons at the quantum level with potential applications in quantum information technologies. We propose a grating-based architecture for fully quantized free-electron quantum optics, in which photon-electron interactions map onto Jaynes-Cummings and Tavis-Cummings models via Bloch-Floquet analysis. Within this framework, we design ultrafast single- and two-qubit gates with cavity-free flying electrons, enabling universal quantum computing in experimentally accessible setups. More broadly, this framework establishes a platform for probing free-electron quantum optics and advancing quantum technologies in simulation, sensing, and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Subradiant Decay in 2D and 3D Atomic Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicola Piovella, Romain Bachelard</p>
            <p>Subradiance is a phenomenon where coupled emitters radiate light at a slower rate than independent ones. While its observation was first reported in disordered cold atom clouds, ordered subwavelength arrays of emitters have emerged as promising platforms to design highly cooperative optical properties based on dipolar interactions. In this work we characterize the eigenmodes of 2D and 3D regular arrays, using a method which can be used for both infinite and very large systems. In particular, we show how finite-size effects impact the lifetimes of these large arrays. Our results may have interesting applications for quantum memories and topological effects in ordered atomic arrays.</p>

            <h2>Collective Enhancement of Photon Blockade via Two-Photon Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lijuan Dong, Aanal Jayesh Shah, Peter Kirton, Hadiseh Alaeian, Simone Felicetti</p>
            <p>Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.</p>

            <h2>Vector magnetometry using cavity-enhanced microwave readout in nitrogen-vacancy diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reginald Wilcox, David Phillips, Matthew Steinecker, Erik Eisenach, Corey Hawkins, Linh Pham, Jennifer Schloss, Dirk Englund, Danielle Braje</p>
            <p>We demonstrate $4\pi$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</p>

            <h2>Scattering theory of frequency-entangled biphoton states facilitated by cavity polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei Piryatinski, Nishaant Jacobus, Sameer Dambal, Eric R. Bittner, Yu Zhang, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada</p>
            <p>The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regimes. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how the interaction of the entangled photon pair with the polariton/bipolariton modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We suggest that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity state.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Frustration as a Protection Mechanism in Non-Topological Majorana Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Novais</p>
            <p>I analyze the decoherence of a $\pi$-junction qubit encoded by two co-located Majorana modes. Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum this http URL mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.</p>

            <h2>Cooling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using thermofield double states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Schuster, Bryce Kobrin, Vincent P. Su, Hugo Marrochio, Norman Y. Yao</p>
            <p>We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.</p>

            <h2>Temporal quantum interference in many-body programmable atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhumita Sarkar, Ben Zindorf, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Sougato Bose, Roopayan Ghosh</p>
            <p>Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, Stückelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.</p>

            <h2>A measurement-driven quantum algorithm for SAT: Performance guarantees via spectral gaps and measurement parallelization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Franz J. Schreiber, Maximilian J. Kramer, Alexander Nietner, Jens Eisert</p>
            <p>The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is of central importance in both theory and practice. Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Peng</p>
            <p>We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Two-Mode Janus States: non-Gaussian generalizations of thermofield double</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Azizi</p>
            <p>We introduce the Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS), a non-Gaussian quantum state defined as a coherent superposition of two distinct Two-Mode Squeezed States (TMSS). This construction serves as a direct, non-Gaussian generalization of the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, which is itself a single, Gaussian TMSS. We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of "squeezing polynomials" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external "Janus phase." This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect. The TMJS provides a versatile, interference-enhanced platform for engineering Unruh-DeWitt detector responses and probing non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings.</p>

            <p>Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, enabling detailed characterization of correlations, entanglement, and electronic structure in quantum systems. However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states. Numerical and hardware results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability, providing a robust foundation for physically consistent fermionic state reconstruction in realistic quantum simulations.</p>

            <h2>Provably Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Solving Nonlinear Differential Equations Using Multiple Bosonic Modes Coupled with Qubits</h2>

            <p>Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.</p>

            <h2>Improved coherence time of a non-Hermitian qubit in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duttatreya, Ipsika Mohanty, Sanjib Dey</p>
            <p>Quantum computing's potential for exponential speedup is fundamentally limited by decoherence, a phenomenon arising from environmental interactions. Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, particularly $PT$-symmetric systems, offers a novel framework for extending coherence times. This study examines a qubit's coherence under non-Hermitian $PT$-symmetric dynamics, highlighting significantly enhanced coherence times compared to Hermitian setups. The effect is especially pronounced when both the system and environment exhibit $PT$-symmetry. Interestingly, greater environmental non-Hermiticity correlates with extended coherence, contrary to traditional expectations. These findings point to promising strategies for managing decoherence, which could significantly advance approaches to quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We investigate enantiodetection for both a single cyclic three-level chiral molecule and finite ensembles of such molecules by monitoring the steady-state intracavity photon number in a cavity-QED platform. Our scheme exploits the intrinsic global $\pi$-phase difference between opposite enantiomers to engineer destructive and/or constructive interference pathways, enabling a direct readout of enantiomeric excess with an error below $5\%$. To capture mesoscopic many-molecule effects beyond mean field while avoiding brute-force master-equation simulations, we employ a generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation, which is well suited for systems with many yet finite molecules. These results pave the way for implementing enantiodetection in realistic quantum-optical settings.</p>

            <h2>Photon transport and blockade based on non-Markovian interactions between a microring resonator and waveguide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haijin Ding</p>
            <p>We investigate photon transport and blockade based on the architecture where a waveguide is coupled to a microring resonator at two distinct points. This two-point coupling configuration between the waveguide and resonator gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, which is induced by the photon transmission delay in the waveguide between the two coupled points. On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.</p>

            <p>Scaling superconducting quantum processors beyond single dilution refrigerators requires efficient optical interconnects, yet integrating microwave-to-optical (M2O) transducers poses challenges due to frequency mismatches and qubit decoherence. We propose a modular architecture using SNAIL-based parametric coupling to interface Brillouin M2O transducers with long-lived 3D cavities, while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility. Through numerical simulations incorporating realistic noises, including laser heating, propagation losses, and detection inefficiency, we demonstrate raw entangled bit fidelities of F~0.8 at kHz-level rates over 30 km using the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol. Implementing asymmetric entanglement pumping tailored to amplitude damping errors, we achieve purified fidelities F~0.94 at 0.2 kHz rates.

            <h2>Entanglement Phase Transition in Chaotic non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Tao Zhang, Feng Mei</p>
            <p>We have studied entanglement phase transition in a class of chaotic non-Hermitian spin chain in which its spin-spin coupling term commutes with the non-Hermitian term. Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels. Our work reveals a novel entanglement transition in chaotic non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Structure of Nonlocal Field Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reza Pirmoradian, M. Hossein Bek-Khoshnevis, Sadaf Ebadi, M. Reza Tanhayi</p>
            <p>Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.</p>

Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are shown to emerge from the span of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebra, suggesting that scattering in this context is fundamentally governed by the action of ``bit flips'' on the internal quantum numbers.

            <p>Finite-size general security proofs for quantum key distribution based on Rényi entropies have recently been introduced. These approaches are more flexible and provide tighter bounds on the secret key rate than traditional formulations based on the von Neumann entropy. However, deploying them requires minimizing the conditional Rényi entropy, a difficult optimization problem that has hitherto been tackled using ad-hoc techniques based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which are unstable and can only handle particular cases. In this work, we introduce a method based on non-symmetric conic optimization for solving this problem. Our technique is fast, reliable, and completely general. We illustrate its performance on several protocols, whose results represent an improvement over the state of the art.</p>

            <p>The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $\Lambda=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvia Cardenas-Lopez, Edgar Guardiola-Navarrete, Ana Asenjo-Garcia</p>
            <p>Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.</p>

            <p>The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.</p>

            <h2>Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brenden Bowen, Albert Farah, Spasen Chaykov, Nishant Agarwal</p>
            <p>Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaofeng Huang, Yu-Peng Wang, Jie Ren, Chen Fang</p>
            <p>Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-\gamma}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($\rho \sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($\sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^{\gamma -1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.</p>

Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.</p>

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</p>

Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD.

Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR.

            <p>SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pilsung Kang</p>
            <p>Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(\Delta_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism. We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.</p>

A principal fiber bundle over the manifold of density operators distinguishes the quantum state structure from thermodynamic labels: its fibers represent non-equilibrium configurations, and their unique intersections with the equilibrium submanifold enforce thermodynamic consistency. Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law. Non-equilibrium extensions, formulated through pseudo-Riemannian metrics and connections on the principal bundle, introduce curvature-induced holonomy that quantifies irreversibility in cyclic processes. In this framework, the thermodynamic laws in the quantum regime emerge naturally as geometric consequences.</p>

            <h2>Competing Localizations on Disordered Non-Hermitian Random Graph Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S Rahul, A Harshitha</p>
            <p>Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that render the underlying nature of random graph. By varying $p,$ $\Delta$ and the disorder, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show the competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations in the parameter regimes. Despite the presence of large disorder, the skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson driven localization.</p>

            <h2>Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Outongyi Lv, Yewei Yuan, Nana Liu</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding. We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL. We further investigate the $\Delta$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) unifies the Berry curvature (its imaginary part) and the quantum metric (its real part), yet Raman studies of chiral phonons have so far accessed only the former. We perform circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on the quantum magnet K2Co(SeO3)2, where the field-odd chiral splitting and the field-even center-frequency shift collapse onto a single curve across temperature and magnetic field, revealing a common microscopic origin for both observables. Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement.</p>

            <p>Harnessing a beam of slow free electrons in artificial photonic structures offers a powerful, tunable platform for generating nonclassical light without the need for heavy physical equipment. Here we present a theory of nonclassical lasing, demonstrating how incoherent electrons in photonic crystal cavities can coherently emit photons through collective dynamics. When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state). Notably, the frequency of the emitted photons can be readily tuned via the velocity of the injected electrons to match cavity modes. This approach supports photonic integration and offers a scalable, energy-efficient platform for room-temperature quantum light sources and advanced studies in quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>We study the interplay between crossing symmetry and entanglement in $2 \to 2$ scattering within local quantum field theories that possess an $SU(N)$ global symmetry. In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Mao, Eun-Ah Kim</p>
            <p>Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.</p>

            <p>In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.</p>

In this study, we demonstrate the influence of graph minor embedding on fair sampling of degenerate ground states. For two embedded models that introduce auxiliary variables, numerical simulations of Schrödinger evolution revealed that fairness varies significantly depending on the embedding, and the chain strength is related to ground-state fairness. Using perturbation theory, we found that chain strength determines the energy landscape around ground states, with flatter landscapes having higher probabilities of being obtained.</p>

            <p>To better understand quantum computation we can search for its limits or no-gos, especially if analogous limits do not appear in classical computation. Classical computation easily implements and extensively employs the addition of two bit strings, so here we study 'quantum addition': the superposition of two quantum states. We prove the impossibility of superposing two unknown states, no matter how many samples of each state are available. The proof uses topology; a quantum algorithm of any sample complexity corresponds to a continuous function, but the function required by the superposition task cannot be continuous by topological arguments. Our result for the first time quantifies the approximation error and the sample complexity $N$ of the superposition task, and it is tight. We present a trivial algorithm with a large approximation error and $N=1$, and the matching impossibility of any smaller approximation error for any $N$. Consequently, our results limit state tomography as a useful subroutine for the superposition. State tomography is useful only in a model that tolerates randomness in the superposed state. The optimal protocol in this random model remains open.</p>

These protocols rely on optical CNOT gates and we vary the probability with which they can be successfully performed. Encoding our entangled states in photon polarization, we analyse the effect of depolarizing noise on the photonic states as the carrier passes through the fibers. Building a robust model of photon loss and calculating the distillable entanglement of the noisy states, we find the entanglement distribution rate. We discover that methods involving a separable carrier can reach a higher rate than the standard entanglement distribution protocol, provided that the success probability of the optical CNOT gates is sufficiently high.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks aim to facilitate the fault-tolerant and secure transmission of quantum states across distant devices. The widely adopted quantum teleportation scheme requires multiple rounds of entanglement swapping and purification, leading to significant resource overhead and operational complexity. In this study, we propose a novel fault-tolerant and secure quantum communication scheme based on uncorrectable error injection. Our method exploits a quantum state encoding scheme based on quantum error correction codes, which strategically introduces uncorrectable errors to enhance security. It eliminates the need for entanglement distribution while reducing resource requirements. The injected errors protect against eavesdropping by preventing unauthorized parties from retrieving meaningful information. Security analysis shows that as the data length and encoded message size increase, information leakage becomes negligible relative to the size of the total message. Comparative performance analysis with existing approaches indicates that our method reduces transmission overhead while maintaining comparable fidelity in low-error regimes. These findings suggest that the proposed method offers a scalable and practical alternative for secure long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and future quantum internet applications.</p>

            <p>We develop a quantum field theory based on random nonHermitian actions, which upon quantization lead to stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger dynamics for the state vector. In this framework, Lorentz and spacetime translation symmetries are preserved only in a statistical sense: the probability distribution of the action remains invariant under these transformations. As a result, the theory describes ensembles of quantum-state trajectories whose probability distributions remain invariant under changes of reference frame. As a concrete example, we augment the Dirac action with a purely imaginary term coupling the fermion density operator to a universal colored noise. This noise is constructed by solving the d'Alembert equation with white noise as its source, using a generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3 dimensions. We demonstrate that the colored noise drives stochastic localization of wave packets and derive the localization length analytically. Remarkably, the localization length decreases as the size of the observable universe increases. Our model thus provides a potential framework for relativistic spontaneous wave-function collapse. While establishing consistency with Born's law remains an open challenge, the present work constitutes a step toward embedding collapse models into a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers, and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songbo Xie, Manas Sajjan, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>Quantum energy teleportation (QET) has been proposed to overcome the restrictions of strong local passivity (SLP) and to facilitate energy transfer in quantum systems. Traditionally, QET has only been considered under strict constraints, including the requirements that the initial state be the ground state of an interacting Hamiltonian, that Alice's measurement commute with the interaction terms, and that entanglement be present. These constraints have significantly limited the broader applicability of QET protocols. In this work, we demonstrate that SLP can arise beyond these conventional constraints, establishing the necessity of QET in a wider range of scenarios for local energy extraction. This leads to a more flexible and generalized framework for QET. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a ``local effective Hamiltonian,'' which eliminates the need for optimization techniques in determining Bob's optimal energy extraction in QET protocols. As an additional advantage, the amount of energy that can be extracted using our new protocol is amplified to be 7.2 times higher than that of the original protocol. These advancements enhance our understanding of QET and extend its broader applications to quantum technologies. To support our findings, we implement the protocol on quantum hardware, confirming its theoretical validity and experimental feasibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> En-Jui Chang</p>
            <p>Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 3]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,3]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.</p>

This enables us to learn the algorithm structure rather than a specific unitary implementation. We demonstrate our method by automatically designing three known quantum algorithms-the Quantum Fourier Transform, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Grover's search. Remarkably, we were able to learn the general implementation of each algorithm by considering examples of circuits containing at most 5-qubits. Our method proves robust, as it maintains performance across increasingly large search spaces.

            <h2>Superradiant Peak Emission Rate and Time in Quantum Emitter Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator. Generally, the dimension of the density operator grows exponentially ($\sim \! 2^N$) with the number of emitters, in the absence of any symmetries such as in Dicke superradiance with full or partial permutational symmetry. We present a detailed study of the superradiant peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, for one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays in free-space and emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs. For few emitters ($N\lesssim 14$) we utilize the full quantum master equation, and for mesoscopic emitter numbers ($N\lesssim 400$) we use a second- and third-order cumulant expansion of the operator averages to track the time evolution of the system.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi</p>
            <p>To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</p>

            <h2>Bounds in Sequential Unambiguous Discrimination of Multiple Pure Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordi Pérez-Guijarro, Alba Pagès-Zamora, Javier R. Fonollosa</p>
            <p>Sequential methods for quantum hypothesis testing offer significant advantages over fixed-length approaches, which rely on a predefined number of state copies. Despite their potential, these methods remain underexplored for unambiguous discrimination. In this work, we derive performance bounds for such methods when applied to the discrimination of a set of pure states. The performance is evaluated based on the expected number of copies required. We establish a lower bound applicable to any sequential method and an upper bound on the optimal sequential method. The upper bound is derived using a novel and simple non-adaptive method. Importantly, the gap between these bounds is minimal, scaling logarithmically with the number of distinct states.</p>

            <p>In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum-limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. If not taken into account, the error on the signal strength can be as large as a factor of about 2, which is unacceptable for quantitative experiments. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +- 20 % limited by sources of noise internal to the optomechanical element.</p>

            <p>Efficient quantum state preparation remains a central challenge in first-principles quantum simulations of dynamics in quantum field theories, where the Hilbert space is intrinsically infinite-dimensional. Here, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-assisted framework for quantum-circuit design that systematically scales state-preparation circuits to large lattice volumes. Applied to a 1+1d XY spin chain, the LLM autonomously discovers a compact 4-parameter circuit that captures boundary-induced symmetry breaking with sub-percent energy deviation, enabling successful validation on the \texttt{Zuchongzhi} quantum processor. Guided by this insight, we extend the framework to 2+1d quantum field theories, where scalable variational ansätze have remained elusive. For a scalar field theory, the search yields a symmetry-preserving, 3-parameter shallow-depth ansatz whose optimized parameters converge to size-independent constants for lattices $n \ge 4$, providing, to our knowledge, the first scalable ansatz for this class of 2+1d models. Our results establish a practical route toward AI-assisted, human-guided discovery in quantum simulation.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization in open many-body systems and KMS detailed balance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Scandi, Álvaro M. Alhambra</p>
            <p>Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point up to a small renormalization of the system Hamiltonian, but it also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit of a coarse-graining time much larger than the inverse of the smallest frequency difference. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Detector noise in continuous-variable quantum key distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihong Pan, Dimitri Monokandylos, Bing Qi</p>
            <p>In continuous-variable (CV) QKD with optical coherent detection, the widely adopted \textit{trusted detector noise} model improves both the secret key rate and the transmission distance. This model assumes that detector noise is inherently random and inaccessible to an adversary. While substantial research has focused on shielding the detector, it is far more difficult to justify the adversary's ignorance of the detector noise. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{calibrated detector noise} model for CV-QKD, which relies solely on the isolation of the detector from the adversary's intervention. Specifically, our model applies even when detector noise is predictable to the adversary. We analyze the electrical noise of a commercial balanced photoreceiver and perform numerical simulations to compare different noise models. Our results show that when the detector noise variance is an order of magnitude below the vacuum noise, the proposed model achieves a secret key rate comparable to that of the trusted detector noise model, while eliminating the questionable assumption of ``truly random'' detector noise.</p>

            <p>The transmon, a fabrication-friendly superconducting qubit, remains a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing. Recent advances in tunable couplers have accelerated progress toward high-performance quantum processors. However, extending coherent interactions beyond millimeter scales to enhance quantum connectivity presents a critical challenge. Here, we introduce a hybrid-mode coupler exploiting resonator-transmon hybridization to simultaneously engineer the two lowest-frequency mode, enabling high-contrast coupling between centimeter-scale transmons. For a 1-cm coupler, our framework predicts flux-tunable $XX$ and $ZZ$ coupling strengths reaching 23 MHz and 100 MHz, with modulation contrasts exceeding $10^2$ and $10^4$, respectively, demonstrating quantitative agreement with an effective two-channel model. This work provides an efficient pathway to mitigate the inherent connectivity constraints imposed by short-range interactions, enabling transmon-based architectures compatible with hardware-efficient quantum tasks.</p>

One experimental sample was exposed to 17-mW average power picosecond attacking pulses that temporarily reduced its isolation below the specified guaranteed minimum value. This indicates a potential security threat in these attacking laser regimes that need to be addressed by improving security analysis for various light-injection attacks.</p>

            <p>We present an adaptive variational quantum algorithm to estimate the Berry phase accumulated by a nondegenerate ground state under cyclic, adiabatic evolution of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. Our method leverages cyclic adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian and employs adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and evolution, optimizing circuit efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. We benchmark our approach on dimerized Fermi-Hubbard chains with four sites, demonstrating precise Berry phase simulations in both noninteracting and interacting regimes. Our results show that circuit depths reach up to 106 layers for noninteracting systems and increase to 279 layers for interacting systems due to added complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme across a wide range of parameters governing adiabatic evolution and variational algorithm. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive variational quantum algorithms for advancing quantum simulations of topological materials and computing geometric phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

This paper provides a comprehensive, self-contained derivation of this result, elucidating the underlying geometric and probabilistic structures. We achieve this by developing a framework centered on the computation of Hilbert-Schmidt volumes for key components: the quantum state space, relevant flag manifolds, and regular (co)adjoint orbits. Crucially, we establish and leverage the connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability probability. Our approach offers a transparent pathway to this fundamental constant, detailing the interplay between symplectic geometry, representation theory, and quantum probability.</p>

            <h2>Surrogate Quantum Circuit Design for the Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Monica Lăcătuş, Matthias Möller</p>
            <p>This study introduces a framework for learning a low-depth surrogate quantum circuit (SQC) that approximates the nonlinear, dissipative, and hence non-unitary Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator in the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the D2Q9 lattice. By appropriately selecting the quantum state encoding, circuit architecture, and measurement protocol, non-unitary dynamics emerge naturally within the physical population space. This approach removes the need for probabilistic algorithms relying on any ancilla qubits and post-selection to reproduce dissipation, or for multiple state copies to capture nonlinearity. The SQC is designed to preserve key physical properties of the BGK operator, including mass conservation, scale equivariance, and D8 equivariance, while momentum conservation is encouraged through penalization in the training loss. When compiled to the IBM Heron quantum processor's native gate set, assuming all-to-all qubit connectivity, the circuit requires only 724 native gates and operates locally on the velocity register, making it independent of the lattice size. The learned SQC is validated on two benchmark cases, the Taylor-Green vortex decay and the lid-driven cavity, showing accurate reproduction of vortex decay and flow recirculation. While integration of the SQC into a quantum LBM framework presently requires measurement and re-initialization at each timestep, the necessary steps towards a measurement-free formulation are outlined.</p>

            <p>Bosonic systems, particularly in quantum optics and atomic physics, are leading platforms for achieving quantum enhanced precision in parameter estimation. By exploiting properties such as mode and particle entanglement, it is possible to attain precisions that surpass the shot noise limit with respect to key resources like probe number or energy. Yet the mechanisms by which these bosonic resources enable quantum enhancement remain unclear. Consequently, the design of optimal probes and evolutions often relies on case by case analyses, where continuous and discrete variable regimes are treated separately and their connection is still unclear. We develop a comprehensive framework for quantum metrology that unifies all known precision enhancement mechanisms based on bosonic systems. Our approach employs a superselection rule compliant representation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly includes the phase reference, thereby enforcing total particle number conservation and bridging the discrete and continuous limits of quantum optics and symmetric massive systems. Within this unified formalism, of which established results emerge as special cases, we identify the distinct roles of mode and particle entanglement for quantum enhanced precision. The framework further provides general measurement optimization strategies for arbitrary multimode entangled probe states and naturally incorporates noise and non-unitary dynamics, ensuring applicability to realistic experimental conditions.</p>

            <p>The existence of electromagnetic radiation - radio-waves, microwaves, light, x-rays and so on - is one of the most important physical phenomena, and our ability to manipulate them is one of the most significant technological achievement of humankind. Underlying this ability is our understanding of how radiation is produced: whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates. Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here we prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple (once one knows what to do) but its reasons are deep: it relies on the fact that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act on them, via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here is just them tip of an iceberg - it implies the need to reconsider the basic understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.</p>

            <p>Non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving a quantum advantage in continuous-variable (CV) information processing. Among these, coherent superpositions of squeezed states are a foundational resource. While exact higher-order statistics are available in the undisplaced case, a complete and analytically tractable treatment with a common displacement has been missing. We introduce and solve the displaced Janus state-a coherent superposition of two squeezed coherent states that share the same displacement-and develop an analytical framework, based on a family of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials, that yields closed-form expressions for arbitrary-order factorial moments and coherence functions \(g^{(k)}(0)\), the full Wigner function, and the quantum Fisher information. The analysis shows how interference at a fixed mean, driven by a mismatch of the component covariances rather than by mean separation, can be precisely engineered to transform the extreme photon bunching of the constituents into strong sub-Poissonian and even perfect multiphoton suppression. We further provide a rigorous quantum Fisher information analysis, proving that parameters encoded by linear generators (for example, the number operator) are bounded by the standard quantum limit, whereas parameters encoded by quadratic generators (for example, squeezing transformations) achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, these results furnish a complete analytical toolkit for a versatile class of non-Gaussian states, establishing the displaced Janus state as a key primitive for hybrid quantum protocols, quantum metrology, and fault-tolerant continuous-variable computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential to revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in a distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore, designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time, epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilhem Doat, Augustin Vanrietvelde</p>
            <p>The study of quantum reference frames has received renewed interest over the last years, leading to the parallel development of non-equivalent frameworks by different communities. We clarify the differences between these frameworks. At the mathematical level, they mainly differ in the kind of symmetry (either weak or strong) employed to constrain the system. We show that this mathematical difference corresponds to a fundamental physical question: whether the global charge associated to the symmetry group is accessible to symmetry-constrained observers. In this context, we formulate a definition of a perspective in terms of operational capacities, or lack thereof. Turning to consequences of adopting either approach, we discuss how adopting the weak approach induces an ambiguity in the momenta included in each perspective and bars from defining reversible QRF transformations. We then review and analyze the existing arguments motivating each approach, and show how they bear upon the problem of charge accessibility. Finally, we introduce a simple operational scenario in which upholding two reasonable physical postulates leads to the conclusion that internal observers could measure the global charge by 1/ performing a relativized interference measurement and 2/ classically communicating.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele D'Avino, Gabriel Senno, Mir Alimuddin, Antonio Acín</p>
            <p>Quantum information tasks are often analyzed under varying trust assumptions about the devices involved. The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers a balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this work, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption in a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared quantum states. In contrast to previous studies that restricted the preparation and measurement devices to be classically correlated, we show that allowing entanglement strictly enlarges the set of achievable correlations. We identify two operational consequences of this result. The first concerns randomness certification, where we show that allowing the adversary to employ entangled strategies may significantly reduce the amount of certifiable randomness. This includes situations where the amount of randomness drops to zero in the presence of entanglement, while it remains positive when entanglement is excluded. Second, for the task of distinguishing an arbitrary quantum channel from the identity, we show that the known dimension-independent bound on the advantage conferred by entanglement is violated under an energy constraint.</p>

We define spatial incompatibility (SI) as the minimum distance between a PDM and valid density matrices. For trace-norm distance, we show that this reduces to the PDM's negativity, enabling the construction of experimentally accessible SI witnesses. We derive a tight bound on SI for quantum channels and analyze the respective roles of state and channel coherence in witnessing SI. Our approach, unlike the LG framework, exploits measurements that generate coherence through state disturbance. We further show that channels satisfying the LG inequality for incoherent states can still exhibit detectable SI, demonstrating that measurement disturbance enhances the certification of temporal correlations.</p>

            <p>We study quantum differential privacy (QDP) by defining a notion of the order of informativeness between two pairs of quantum states. In particular, we show that if the hypothesis testing divergence of the one pair dominates over that of the other pair, then this dominance holds for every $f$-divergence. This approach completely characterizes $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-QDP mechanisms by identifying the most informative $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP quantum state pairs. We apply this to analyze the stability of quantum differentially private learning algorithms, generalizing classical results to the case $\delta>0$. Additionally, we study precise limits for privatized hypothesis testing and privatized quantum parameter estimation, including tight upper-bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.</p>

            <h2>Contrasting GHZ and W-state Entanglement Dynamics due to Correlated Markov Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephen Brockerhoff, Brittany Corn-Agostini</p>
            <p>The ability to preserve multipartite entanglement in noisy environments is central to advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we develop a semiclassical theoretical model of three entangled qubits exposed to local Markov noise environments with tunable statistical correlations between noise sources. We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.</p>

We propose a five-stage framework for this process, spanning from theoretical explorations of quantum advantage to the practicalities of compilation and resource estimation. For each stage, we discuss key trends, milestones, and inherent scientific and sociological impediments. We argue that two central stages -- identifying concrete problem instances expected to exhibit quantum advantage, and connecting such problems to real-world use cases -- represent essential and currently under-resourced challenges. Throughout, we touch upon related topics, including the promise of generative artificial intelligence for aspects of this research, criteria for compelling demonstrations of quantum advantage, and the future of compilation as we enter the era of early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</p>

            <p>SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps,while the electron-phonon interaction time decreases, with the magnitude of change depending on temperature and sample this http URL reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>How gravitational waves change photon orbital angular momentum quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haorong Wu, Xilong Fan, Lixiang Chen</p>
            <p>We explore the evolution of vortex light in the presence of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate that the quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM) states can make transitions to other states due to the GWs. The interaction is calculated based on the framework of the wave propagation in linearized gravity theory and canonical quantization of the light field in curved spacetime. It is found that when a photon possessing OAM of $l$ interacts with GWs, the OAM modes of $l\pm1$ and $l\pm2$ may be excited with probabilities of $P_{l\pm1}\sim 10^{-17}$ and $P_{l\pm2}\sim 10^{-20}$, respectively. Higher probabilities of the transitions can be achieved when the photon radial wave vector or the propagation distance is increased, or when the photons encounter GWs with stronger amplitudes or smaller frequencies. Thus, a new GW detection technique is proposed, which may exhibit good performance in a wide range of GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is insensitive to seismic noise and is more advantageous for determining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer detectors.</p>

            <p>Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image and manifests itself in diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields in it remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover a universal mechanism of spin-selective chiral photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. This mechanism embodies a chiral molecular compass - a photoinduced magnetization vector that orients the photoelectron spin. It arises in photoexcited chiral molecules even under isotropic illumination, operates even in isotropic chiral media, and enables a phenomenon central to CISS: locking of the photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. It shows that chiral molecules can sustain time-odd correlations whereas achiral molecules cannot. Our findings have broad implications, from unambiguously identifying the origin of CISS effect in photoionization to harvesting correlations underlying this effect in other forms of CISS in various chiral materials.</p>

            <h2>Multi-agent Markov Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuze Chen, Tianyi Peng</p>
            <p>Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored. In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs. Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.</p>

            <h2>On the fate of spacetime singularities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Piazza</p>
            <p>I investigate spacetime singularities from the point of view of the wavefunction of the universe. In order to extend the classical notion of geodesic incompleteness one has to include the proper time of an observer as a degree of freedom in the Wheeler DeWitt equation. This leads to a Schrödinger equation along the observer worldline. Near the singularity, as in the classical BLK treatment, I ignore spatial gradients and effectively describe the spacetime around the worldline in the mini-superspace approximation. Then the problem proves identical to a spherically symmetric scattering of a quantum particle off a central potential and singularity avoidance is tantamount to unitary evolution for this system. Standard types of matter (dust, radiation) correspond to regular potentials and thus lead to a bounce. The most singular component, spatial anisotropy, is associated to a conserved charge and yields a negative inverse-square potential -- like standard angular momentum, but with opposite sign. This potential is critical, in that the unitarity of the evolution depends on the actual numerical factor in front of it, i.e., on the anisotropy charge.</p>

            <h2>Temperature and conditions for thermalization after canonical quenches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Dabelow</p>
            <p>We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable models.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for tunable chiral channels in next generation quantum optical solid-state devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan J. Thomas, Samuel Legge, John D. Close</p>
            <p>We propose a method for using a single-axis atom interferometric gravity gradiometer to measure off-diagonal elements of the gravity gradient tensor. By tilting the gradiometer, the measured gradient becomes a linear combination of different components of the gravity gradient tensor, and through multiple measurements at different tilts the separate tensor components can be inferred. We present a theoretical and numerical investigation of this technique, both for terrestrial surveys where the tilt is statically set by the user and for surveys where a strapdown sensor is dynamically tilted by the motion of the platform. We show that the gradiometer's sensitivity to the vertical gravity gradient is only slightly reduced by this method while allowing for more gradiometer information to be obtained. Major sources of error and loss of sensitivity on dynamic platforms are shown to be mitigated using an optical-gimbal technique employing commercially-available fibre-optic gyroscopes and tip-tilt mirrors.</p>

            <p>This essay offers an epistemological reinterpretation of the foundational divide between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics. Though formally equivalent, the two theories embody distinct modes of knowing: procedural construction and recognitional verification. These epistemic architectures anticipate, in philosophical form, the logical asymmetry expressed by the P versus NP problem in computational complexity. Here, the contrast between efficient generation and efficient recognition is treated not as a mathematical taxonomy but as a framework for understanding how knowledge is produced and validated across physics, computation, and cognition. The essay reconstructs the mathematical history of quantum mechanics through the original derivations of Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Ehrenfest, and Wolfgang Pauli, culminating in John von Neumann's unification of both approaches within the formalism of Hilbert space. By juxtaposing Heisenberg's algorithmic formalism with Schrödinger's representational one, it argues that their divergence reveals a structural feature of scientific reasoning itself-the enduring tension between what can be procedurally constructed and what can only be recognized.</p>

We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</p>

            <p>Solid-state molecular qubits with open-shell ground states have great potential for addressability, scalability, and tunability, but understanding the fundamental limits of quantum coherence in these systems is challenging due to the complexity of the qubit environment. To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $\delta B\sim 10\,\mu{\rm T}- 1\,{\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise. Our work demonstrates the potential of dynamical methods for modeling the open quantum system dynamics of molecular spin qubits.</p>

We apply this method to study the asymptotic heating of a reservoir in spin-boson models, characterizing the deviation from equilibrium conditions. Moreover, we show how a local driving of two qubits can be utilized to stabilize a transient entanglement buildup of the qubits originating from the interaction with a common environment.

            <p>We critically explore the applicability of a recently proposed framework to sample the quantum dynamics of a many-body quantum system interacting with light by stochastic trajectories, applying it to the closed and open Tavis-Cummings model (TCM). The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features.</p>

            <p>Massive quantum systems have emerged as compelling tabletop interface-systems for testing the quantum nature of gravity. However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.</p>

            <p>Photon loss is the biggest enemy in quantum communications. Direct transmission typically results in a small fraction of photons surviving over long distances, hindering advanced applications such as loophole-free Bell tests and device-independent quantum key distribution. Quantum teleportation offers a "disembodied" way of transferring particles through a virtual channel--quantum entanglement--which, in principle, could overcome the photon transmission loss. Experimentally, however, no previous quantum teleportation of single photons has shown a higher survival probability than using direct transmission. To overcome this challenge, here we first propose and demonstrate an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons. Through an effective 15-dB channel loss, we realize a heralding efficiency of 82% for event-ready entangled photons. Based on the prior distributed entanglement, we demonstrate that teleportation-based transmission efficiency offers a 2.95-fold enhancement, compared to using direct transmission through the same channel, therefore establishing an unconditional teleportational advantage.</p>

            <p>The generation of quantum entanglement is important for a wide range of quantum technology protocols. In nanophotonics, a promising platform for quantum technologies, entanglement generation via plasmon-mediated coupling in quantum dot qubits is often modeled within the dipole limit, where only dipolar plasmons of the mediating nanoparticle are considered, and the local response approximation, where nonlocal corrections are ignored. However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits. We find that multipolar modes and size-dependent damping lead to entanglement decay at small coupling distances and limit mediated entanglement with certain particle sizes. We discuss potential implications of multipolar modes in entanglement-based quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Simulating molecular systems on quantum computers requires efficient mappings from Fermionic operators to qubit operators. Traditional mappings such as Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev often produce high-weight Pauli terms, increasing circuit depth and measurement complexity. Although several local qubit mappings have been proposed to address this challenge, most are specialized for structured models like the Hubbard Hamiltonian and perform poorly for realistic chemical systems with dense two-body interactions. In this work, we utilize a suite of techniques to construct compact and noise-resilient Fermion-to-qubit mappings suitable for general molecular Hamiltonians. Building on the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) and other similar works, we demonstrate that it outperforms prior encodings in both accuracy and hardware efficiency for molecular simulations. Our improvements include path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, introduction of multi-edge graph structures for enhanced error detection without added circuit depth, and a stabilizer measurement framework that directly maps logical terms and stabilizers to the Z-basis using Clifford simulation. Applying these methods to simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems yields significantly improved absolute and correlation energy estimates under realistic hardware noise, with further accuracy gains achieved by increasing code distance. We also propose a [[2N, N, 2]] variant of GSE compatible with square-lattice and (quasi-)linear hardware topologies, demonstrating a twofold reduction in RMSE for orbital rotations on IBM Kingston hardware. These results establish GSE as a very attractive mapping for molecular quantum simulations.</p>

            <h2>Boosting Gravity-Induced Entanglement through Parametric Resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuka Shiomatsu, Youka Kaku, Akira Matsumura, Tomohiro Fujita</p>
            <p>Establishing quantum gravity theory remains one of the major challenges in modern physics, as the lack of experimental evidence makes it difficult to explore. In response to this challenge, proposals to test quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravity in table-top experiments have attracted significant attention as a potentially feasible approach far below the Planck energy scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping. As a result, we find an exponential growth of gravity-induced entanglement between the oscillators, which reflects the dynamical instability of parametric resonant systems.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Generation of Multi-partite Entanglement between Non-local Superconducting Qubits using Classical Feedback</h2>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing, the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical field programmable gate array-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local, multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both protocols for implementing a quantum fan-out gate in constant depth among three non-local qubits (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT). Finally, we demonstrate deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on opposite sides of our quantum processor. Throughout this work, we find that the fidelity of our teleportation-based protocols is limited by measurement-induced dephasing on idling spectator qubits. Therefore, our work serves as a useful study of the current benefits and limitations of teleportation-based protocols on contemporary superconducting quantum processors.</p>

Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing quantum violation for multipartite facet Bell inequalities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Fu Chen, Mengyao Hu, Jordi Tura</p>
            <p>Nonlocality shapes quantum correlations, revealed through the violation of Bell inequalities. The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope.</p>

            <h2>Measuring multipartite entanglement efficiently by testing symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Liu, Jordi Tura, Albert Rico</p>
            <p>Recently, a technique known as quantum symmetry test has gained increasing attention for detecting bipartite entanglement in pure quantum states. In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems. Using these results we identify tradeoffs between estimation complexity and sensitivity of the presented entanglement measures, oriented to practical implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Firoz Chogle, Berihu Teklu, Jorge Zubelli, Ernesto Damiani</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear properties of the double-Morse potential as a possible resource for single-mode quantum states because of its double-well structure and anharmonicity. We derive the ground state wave function and the associated energy spectrum analytically, using the asymmetry (width parameter) $\alpha$ as the primary control parameter. These results show a systematic and evident influence on $\alpha$. We assess the non-Gaussianity and non-classicality measures, quantifying their nonlinearity and quantum behavior. In particular, we discover that both metrics rise monotonically with $\alpha$. Furthermore, we examine the metrological performance for estimating $\alpha$. By calculating the pertinent Fisher information and building workable estimators, we show that optimal strategies can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound, with straightforward position measurements on shallow wells already producing high precision. These results collectively demonstrate that the double-Morse potential is a genuine, controllable source of non-Gaussianity, whose non-classicality and metrological applications increase with $\alpha$. We highlight the potential applications of this model in real-world quantum technologies and discuss the implications for continuous-variable quantum information processing and computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC), a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in quantum communication, exploits quantum states for unmediated information transmission. Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits. This breakthrough not only clears the path for large-scale QSDC deployment but also marks a pivotal milestone in quantum information science.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Remote Magnon-Magnon Entanglement with Quantum Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gong, Yan-Xue Cheng, Wei Xiong, Jiaojiao Chen</p>
            <p>Cavity magnonics, owing to its strong magnon-photon coupling and excellent tunability, has attracted significant interest in quantum information science. However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.</p>

            <p>We study the polaritonic states and dynamics of multiple Jahn-Teller (JT) active molecules coupled to the modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity. We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system. Our results uncover new pathways for vibronic angular momentum transfer unique to collective molecular polaritonics with potential implications for cavity-assisted photo-physics and photo-chemistry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Loris Di Cairano, Matteo Gori, Reza Karimpour, Alexandre Tkatchenko</p>
            <p>Interactions between objects can be classified as fundamental or emergent. Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales.</p>

            <h2>Exact-factorization framework for electron-nuclear dynamics in electromagnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir U. Nazarov, E. K. U. Gross</p>
            <p>The Exact Factorization (EF) theory aims at the separation of the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in the many-body (MB) quantum mechanical problem. Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property.</p>

            <p>We present a scalable method for electrically tuning multiple spatially separated quantum dots embedded in photonic crystal waveguides. Ion implantation into the top p-doped layer of a p-i-n diode creates high-resistivity tracks, providing electrical isolation between adjacent regions. Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model. Our results mark an important step towards scalable, multi-emitter architectures for chiral quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.</p>

            <p>Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when the light scattered out of the signal mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.</p>

            <p>Cavity optomechanical systems have recently been proposed as detectors for ultralight dark matter, leveraging their ability to cool and probe mechanical oscillators at the quantum limit. Here we present a resonant search for ultralight dark matter using a cavity optomechanical accelerometer. The detector consists of a cryogenic Si$_3$N$_4$-membrane cavity mounted to a 4 K copper plate, with photothermal tuning used to scan its 39 kHz mechanical resonance. Shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation-pressure feedback cooling yield an acceleration sensitivity of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over 30 Hz near resonance. The detector's material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter field. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched-filter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions.</p>

            <h2>From Quantum Relative Entropy to the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Dorau, Albert Much</p>
            <p>We provide arguments indicating that the semiclassical Einstein equations follow from quantum relative entropy and its proportionality to an area variation. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a central role in what is often seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>

            <p>We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</p>

            <p>Quantum Information Processing (QIP) tasks can be efficiently formulated in terms of quantum dynamical maps, whose formalism is able to provide the appropriate mathematical representation of the evolution of open quantum systems. A key QIP task is quantum state transfer (QST) aimed at sharing quantum information between distant nodes of a quantum network, enabling, e.g. quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. QST has primarily been addressed insofar by resetting the quantum channel after each use, thus giving rise to memoryless channels. Here we consider the case where the quantum channel is continuously used, without implementing time- and resource- consuming resetting operations. We derive a general, analytical expression for the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$-use average QST fidelity for $U(1)$-symmetric channels and apply our formalism to a perfect QST channel in the presence of imperfect readout timing. We show that even relatively small readout timing errors give rise to memory effects which have a highly detrimental impact on subsequent QST tasks.</p>

Using standard homodyne and displacement-based measurements, we show that simple optical setups can achieve dimension-witness violations that certify positive min-entropy, even in the presence of realistic losses and misaligned reference frames. These results demonstrate that practical and scalable quantum randomness generation is achievable with minimal experimental complexity on continuous-variable platforms.</p>

However, implementing scalable quantum nodes with high-fidelity optical readout of the electron spin state requires efficient photon emission and collection from the system. In this manuscript, we report a quantum photonic interface for SnV- centers based on one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities fabricated in diamond thin films. Furthermore, we develop a model describing the spontaneous emission dynamics of our system, allowing for rigorous determination of Purcell factors and the C/D branching ratio from cavity enhancement of the C and D transitions of the SnV- zero phonon line. We observe quality factors up to ~6000 across this sample, and measure up to a 12-fold lifetime reduction. By considering the lifetime reduction of both the C and D transitions independently, we determine the C/D branching ratio to be {\eta}BR=0.7815, in line with previous theoretical and experimental findings. Finally from our analysis, we extract a Purcell factor of up to Fc=26.21(0.01) for a single SnV- transition.</p>

Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.</p>

            <p>Biphoton states have shown promising applications in quantum information processing, including quantum communications, quantum metrology, and quantum imaging. The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction. Here we present a comprehensive method for regulating the topological properties of the system by combining the nonlinearity in waveguides, i.e., nonlinearity in the waveguide coupling materials, and the waveguide lattice structure. Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous "active" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations. Our method enables the reusability and versatility of SSH lattice chips and their application for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, promoting the industrialization process of quantum technology.</p>

            <p>Scalable implementation of quantum networks and photonic processors require integrated photonic memories with high efficiency, yet current integrated systems have been limited to storage efficiencies below 27.8%. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient integrated quantum memories based on rare-earth-iondoped crystals coupled with impedance-matched microcavities, realized in two novel architectures: 200-micrometer-thin membranes of Eu3+:Y2SiO5 integrated with fiber-based microcavities, and waveguide-based cavities fabricated using femtosecond lasers. Our approach achieves reliable integrated quantum storage with record efficiencies of 80.3(7)% for weak coherent pulses and 69.8(1.6)% for telecom-heralded single photons, alongside the storage of 20 temporal modes with an average efficiency of 51.3(2)%. Moreover, the thin-membrane Eu3+:Y2SiO5 architecture enables spectrally tunable efficient quantum storage via variable strain, providing a flexible interface for quantum networks. By combining high efficiency, large multimode capacity, and tunability, our devices establish a versatile hardware foundation for scalable quantum repeaters and chip-scale photonic processors.</p>

            <h2>Recovery of optical losses with the Petz recovery map</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinyan Chen, Minjeong Song, Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>Optical systems are a main platform for quantum information processing, while a hidden challenge in these systems is information loss due to scattering into unmonitored modes, typically modeled as state-independent beam-splitter interactions. While such losses simply erase information encoded across modes, they directly degrade information encoded in the quantum state of a mode. Perfect correction of these Gaussian lossy channels with Gaussian operations alone is known to be impossible. In this work, we investigate the Petz recovery map as an approximate recovery. We construct the Petz recovery of single mode losses and its implementations. In particular, we show that the recovery performance of Petz recovery map is better than the recovery protocol that replaces the noisy state with the belief state. Also, when the reference state is far from the true state, it is better not to use the Petz recovery map but to leave the noisy state instead. We discuss the physical intuition of Petz recovery map and finally shows that it is near-optimal among the considered recovery protocols.</p>

            <p>Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work. We here report the experimental realization of a fully quantum engine that converts quantum coherence into work. A single solid-state spin in diamond is fueled by a coherent bath and cyclically stores energy in a spin quantum battery. We establish quantum-enhanced performance by showing that almost 200$\%$ more work is produced after a few cycle compared to the corresponding classical engine. We obtain concrete criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and highlight the importance of a coherent motor-battery interaction. This device harnesses nonclassical features during all stages of its cycle, and demonstrates the functionality of a nanomachine whose parts are all quantum coherent.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nir Gutman, Eliya Blumenthal, Shay Hacohen-Gourgy, Ariel Orda, Ido Kaminer</p>
            <p>We introduce a family of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes built as a rotation-symmetric superposition of squeezed vacuum states, which promise protection against both loss and dephasing noise channels. The robustness of these "squeezed-vacuum codes" arises from being arranged at evenly spaced angles in phase-space, and simultaneously in evenly spaced photon-number support $n \equiv {2k} \! \pmod {2m}$. We present simple preparation circuits: a two-legged code using a Hadamard-conditional-squeezing-Hadamard sequence on an ancilla qubit, and for general "$m$-legged" codewords using sequences of conditional rotations. The performance of these codes is evaluated against loss and dephasing noises using the Knill-Laflamme violation function and benchmarked against cat codes. As the number $m$ of squeezed-vacuum states in a code increases, the code exhibits improved loss tolerance at the cost of higher dephasing sensitivity. We outline implementations in circuit QED and trapped-ion platforms, where high-fidelity Gaussian operations and conditional controls are available or under active development. These results help establish squeezed-vacuum codes as practical, hardware-ready, members of the bosonic codes class.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanzhou Zhu, Tianyu Wang, Peter L. McMahon, Daniel Soh</p>
            <p>Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been developed to enhance processing speed and energy efficiency in machine learning by leveraging optical devices for nonlinear activation and establishing connections among neurons. In this work, we propose a quantum optical neural network (QONN) that utilizes atom-cavity neurons with controllable photon absorption and emission. These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional QONN to facilitate a real-world satellite image classification (SAT-6) task. Due to its compact hardware and low power consumption, the QONN offers a promising solution for real-time satellite sensing, reducing communication bandwidth with ground stations and thereby enhancing data security.</p>

            <p>Single-photon emitters are fundamental building blocks for quantum information processing, communication and sensing. However, unwanted interactions with bulk phonons in their host environment strongly limit their coherence and controllability. We report single color centers in nanodiamonds that are strongly and comprehensively decoupled from the bulk phononic environment. The color centers feature record-narrow linewidths down to 0.3 nm at room temperature and stable, bright emission, exceeding 10 Mcps in saturation. Notably, the bulk phonon sideband is almost entirely suppressed, revealing the presence of a single localized vibrational mode outside the diamond phonon band. Our observations and simulations point towards a unique mechanism for phonon decoupling in common wide-gap materials, based on a strongly radiative orbital transition coupled to a localized vibrational mode. The new color center enables qualitatively higher performance for applications in quantum networks and nanoscale sensing, and the exploration of new physical resources associated with vibrational states.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum coherence in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system incorporating a squeezed-magnon drive. By analyzing the Gaussian quantum coherence of the cavity, magnonic, and mechanical subsystems, as well as the total system coherence, we identify the critical roles of phase control, coupling strength, drive power, and thermal noise. We show that the squeezing amplitude and phase precisely modulate the effective magnon frequency and damping, enabling phase-dependent enhancement and nonreciprocal transfer of coherence. Our systematic parameter analysis indicates that increasing driving power and photon-magnon coupling enhances quantum coherence, while thermal decoherence leads to its degradation. However, this effect is partially suppressed by the presence of magnon squeezing. The results show that squeezed magnons are a robust and tunable resource for controlling, stabilizing, and optimizing quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanical platforms, offering potential applications in hybrid magnonic systems and coherent quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>High-fidelity two-logical-qubit gates are essential for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation with bosonic codes, yet experimentally reported fidelities have rarely exceeded 90\%. Here, we propose a geometric phase engineering approach for implementing controlled-phase gates for binomially encoded logical qubits. This method leverages the structural simplicity of geometric drives to reduce the numerical optimization dimensionality while fully incorporating system nonlinearities, enabling fast and high-fidelity logical operations. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a process fidelity of 97.4$\pm$0.8\% for a controlled-Z gate between two binomial codes, surpassing all previously reported two-logical-qubit gates in bosonic codes. This work demonstrates that geometric phase engineering provides an effective and experimentally feasible route to fast, high-fidelity logical operations in bosonic quantum processors.</p>

            <p>The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.</p>

            <h2>Fault-Tolerant Encoding of Logical Qudits in Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumin Lim</p>
            <p>The universal quantum computer will enable the simulation of arbitrary quantum states governed by arbitrary Hamiltonians. In this context, it is essential to equip future quantum processors with fault-tolerant logical qudits, since qudits naturally align with the simulation of multi-level physical systems. In this study, we present a general framework and working examples of fault-tolerant logical qudit encoding using spin systems, which are among the most coherent and robust finite multi-level physical platforms. The d-dimensional logical qudit encoding with distance-3 (or 5) codewords can be designed within a 12d (or 40d)-dimensional Hilbert space, and the design can be further generalized to 2t+1-distance codes and to encodings exploiting multiple physical qudits. A quantitative comparison shows that the logical qudit encoding proposed here offers an exponential resource advantage over multi-level mappings from logical qubits, and therefore we believe this strategy can pave the way for realizing logical qudit encodings in finite multi-level physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithm for one quasi-particle excitations in the thermodynamic limit via cluster-additive block-diagonalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.</p>

In the context of estimating multiple parameters of a quantum system, this manifests as a fundamental trade-off between the precisions with which different parameters can be estimated. Often, a parameter can be optimally measured, but at the cost of gaining no information about incompatible parameters. Here, we report that there are systems where one parameter's information can be maximised while not completely losing information about the other parameters. In doing so, we find attainable trade-off relations for quantum parameter estimation with a structure that is different to typical Heisenberg-type trade-offs. We demonstrate our findings by implementing an optimal entangling measurement on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum computer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Fujiu, Shota Nagayama, Shin Nishio, Hideaki Kawaguchi, Takahiko Satoh</p>
            <p>The surface code is one of the leading quantum error correction codes for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu Yang, Yue Li, Mingtao Xu, Wei Yi, Jin-Shi Xu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo</p>
            <p>Open systems feature a variety of phenomena that arise from non-Hermitian physics. Recent theoretical studies have offered much insights into these phenomena through the non-Bloch band theory, though many of the theory's key features are experimentally elusive. For instance, the correspondence between complex momenta and non-Hermitian bands, while central to non-Bloch band theory, has so far defied direct experimental observation. Here we experimentally study the non-Hermitian spectral deformation in complex-momentum space, by implementing a non-Hermitian lattice with long-range couplings in the synthetic orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) dimension of photons inside a degenerate cavity. Encoding the complex momenta in the phase and amplitude modulations of the OAM modes, and devising a complex-momentum-resolved projective detection, we reconstruct the spectral deformation in momentum space, where the eigenspectrum on the complex plane morphs through distinct geometries. This enables us to experimentally extract key information of the system under the non-Bloch band theory, including exceptional points in the complex-momentum space, the open-boundary spectra, and the generalized Brillouin zone. Our work demonstrates a versatile platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics and non-Bloch band theory, and opens the avenue for direct experimental investigation of non-Bloch features in the complex-momentum space.</p>

            <p>Quantum algorithms have demonstrated provable speedups over classical counterparts, yet establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework to understand the quantum advantage remains a core challenge. In this work, we decode the quantum search advantage by investigating the critical role of quantum state properties in random-walk-based algorithms. We propose three distinct variants of quantum random-walk search algorithms and derive exact analytical expressions for their success probabilities. These probabilities are fundamentally determined by specific initial state properties: the coherence fraction governs the first algorithm's performance, while entanglement and coherence dominate the outcomes of the second and third algorithms, respectively. We show that increased coherence fraction enhances success probability, but greater entanglement and coherence reduce it in the latter two cases. These findings reveal fundamental insights into harnessing quantum properties for advantage and guide algorithm design. Our searches achieve Grover-like speedups and show significant potential for quantum-enhanced machine learning.</p>

            <p>We study, classify, and explore the mathematical properties of finite-dimensional Lie algebras occurring in the quantum dynamics of single-mode and self-interacting bosonic systems. These Lie algebras are contained in the real skew-hermitian Weyl algebra $\hat{A}_1$, defined as the real subalgebra of the Weyl algebra $A_1$ consisting of all skew-hermitian polynomials. A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone? (ii)~What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ that contain the free Hamiltonian? (iii) What are the non-abelian and finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras that can be faithfully realized in $\hat{A}_1$? We answer the first question by providing all possible realizations of all finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebras that are generated by monomials alone. We answer the second question by proving that any non-abelian and finite-dimensional subalgebra of $\hat{A}_1$ that contains a free Hamiltonian term must be a subalgebra of the Schrödinger algebra. We partially answer the third question by classifying all nilpotent and non-solvable Lie algebras that can be realized in $\hat{A}_1$, and comment on the remaining cases. Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results for quantum control theory. Our work constitutes an important stepping stone to understanding quantum dynamics of bosonic systems in full generality.</p>

Central to realizing the potential of quantum computing are perfect entangling (PE) two-qubit gates, which serve as a critical building block for universal quantum computation. In the context of quantum optimal control, shaping electromagnetic pulses to drive quantum gates is crucial for pushing gate performance toward theoretical limits. In this work, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover near-optimal pulse shapes that yield PE gates. A collection of RL agents is trained within robust simulation environments, enabling the identification of effective control strategies even under noisy conditions. Selected agents are then validated on higher-fidelity simulations, illustrating how RL-based methods can reduce calibration overhead when compared to quantum optimal control techniques. Furthermore, the RL approach is hardware agnostic with the potential for broad applicability across various quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p>The pursuit of practical quantum utility on near-term quantum processors is critically challenged by their inherent noise. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation.</p>

Unlike dynamical phases, geometric phases exhibit intrinsic resilience to certain types of perturbation, making them particularly valuable for quantum information processing, where maintaining coherent quantum operations is essential.

We first review a unified theoretical framework that can encompass all existing nonadiabatic GQC approaches, then systematically examine the design principles of nonadiabatic geometric gates with a particular focus on how optimal control techniques can be leveraged to improve the accuracy and noise resistance. In addition, we conducted detailed numerical comparisons of various nonadiabatic GQC protocols, offering a quantitative assessment of their respective performance characteristics and practical limitations. Through this focused investigation, our aim is to provide researchers with both fundamental insights and practical guidance for advancing geometric approaches in quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries (QBs), acting as energy storage devices, have potential applications in future quantum science and technology. However, the QBs inevitably losses energy due to their interaction with environment. How to enhance the performance of the QBs in the open-system case remains an important challenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize the driven-dissipative QBs in atom-waveguide-QED systems and demonstrate significant improvements in both the stored energy and extractable work (ergotropy) of the QBs via feedback control. For a single-atom QB, we show that combining the measurement and coherent feedback controls enables nearly perfect stable charging under the weak coherent driving. For the QB array, the measurement-based feedback allows us to control different dynamical phases in the thermodynamic limit: (i) a continuous boundary time-crystal phase, where persistent periodic energy charge-discharge oscillations emerge despite the presence of the dissipation into the waveguide, and (ii) two stationary phases -- one reaches full charge while the other maintains only small energy storage. This work broadens the scope of driven-dissipative QBs and provides practical strategies for enhancing their performance.</p>

            <p>Relativistic time dilation implies that an accelerating excited atom would have its lifetime prolonged in the lab frame. In this paper, we demonstrate a complementary effect: Longer-lived excited atoms turn out to have been accelerated. We propose the following experiment. An excited atom is prepared in a superposition of momenta. Due to relativistic time dilation, in the lab frame, the decay rate of components with higher momentum is diminished. As time passes without the atom emitting a photon, higher-momentum components become more probable. This results in a time-dependent shift of the expectation value of momentum. Taking into account first-order relativistic corrections, we calculate the force and acceleration undergone by the atom due to the fact that it did not emit a photon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imogen Camp, Nick G. Jones</p>
            <p>Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.</p>

            <h2>Transport regimes of biphoton-state quantum walks in ordered and disordered arrays of nonlinear waveguides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jefferson Delgado-Quesada, Edgar A. Rojas-González</p>
            <p>It is well known that a quantum walk in an ordered medium exhibits ballistic propagation. A related process is the driven quantum walk, in which the number of walkers varies over time. In this work, we show that a driven quantum walk in an array of nonlinear waveguides does not propagate ballistically, but instead exhibits two distinct transport regimes: superballistic and superdiffusive. Moreover, we study the effects of off-diagonal and diagonal disorder. In addition to the observation of Anderson localization, both types of disorder lead to the disappearance of the superballistic regime.</p>

            <h2>Efficient certification of intractable quantum states with few Pauli measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sami Abdul Sater, Maxime Garnier, Thierry Martinez, Harold Ollivier, Ulysse Chabaud</p>
            <p>Verification of quantum computations is crucial as experiments advance toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. Yet, no efficient protocol exists for certifying states generated in the Magic-State Injection model -- the foundation of several fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Here, we introduce an efficient protocol for certifying Clifford-enhanced Product States, a large class of quantum states obtained by applying an arbitrary Clifford circuit to a product of single-qubit, possibly magic, states. Our protocol only requires single-qubit Pauli measurements together with efficient classical post-processing, and has efficient sample complexity in both the independent (i.i.d.) and adversarial (non-i.i.d.) settings. This fills a key gap between Pauli-based certification schemes for stabilizer or (hyper)graph states and general protocols demanding non-Pauli measurements or classically intractable information about the target state. Our work provides the first efficient, Pauli-only certification protocol for the Magic-State Injection model, leading to practical verification of universal quantum computation under minimal experimental assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Extending QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Quantum Optimization Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leanto Sunny, Abhinav Rijal, George Siopsis</p>
            <p>The recently proposed QAOA-GPT framework demonstrated that generative pre-trained transformers can learn mappings between problem graphs and optimized quantum circuits for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this work, we extend QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, focusing on spin-glass Hamiltonians that include cubic interaction terms. Using FEATHER graph embeddings to encode topological information, we train the model on graph-circuit pairs generated via ADAPT-QAOA and evaluate its performance on 8- and 16-qubit instances embedded on heavy-hex lattices. The generative model produces adaptive QAOA-like circuits and corresponding variational parameters in a single forward pass, bypassing the iterative classical optimization loop. The generated circuits achieve average approximation ratios exceeding 0.95, closely matching classically optimized ADAPT-QAOA results, while maintaining consistent parameter distributions across circuit depths. These results demonstrate that QAOA-GPT generalizes effectively to higher-order cost Hamiltonians and complex energy landscapes, establishing generative modeling as a scalable pathway toward autonomous variational circuit design and quantum algorithm discovery in the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary Perspectivism as a Framework of Scientific Inquiry in Quantum Mechanics and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vassilios Karakostas, Elias Zafiris</p>
            <p>Contemporary perspectivism is viewed as a framework of scientific inquiry concerning the origin, generation and systematization of scientific knowledge of nature by focusing on the conditions under which such knowledge may arise in perspectivist terms and investigating the essential ramifications of these conditions. To this end, we develop the conceptual, methodological and semantic framework of contemporary perspectivism according to the norms of the proposed endo-theoretic approach. Implementation of the preceding three-fold scheme in quantum mechanics implies that the global structure of a quantum algebra of events can be consistently comprehended through a multilevel structure of locally variable Boolean perspectives, interconnected in a category-theoretic environment, yielding jointly all the information encoded in the former. In this respect, the proposed approach validates the perspectivist/contextual nature of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level of discourse. Furthermore, due to its general character, it may acquire the form of a theoretical pattern of scientific inquiry in the natural sciences, especially when dealing with complex trans-perspectival phenomena, the analysis of which requires the use of information resulting from more than one perspective. Finally, in the appendix, we provide a concise comparative assessment between our perspectivist framework of quantum theory and Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Delay Time Characterization on FPGA: A Low Nonlinearity, Picosecond Resolution Time-to-Digital Converter on 16-nm FPGA using Bin Sequence Calibration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunwoo Park, Byungkwon Park, Eunsung Kim, Jiwon Yune, Seungho Han, Seunggo Nam</p>
            <p>We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico</p>
            <p>We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Tunable Spin Filtering and Valley Splitting Coexisting with Anomalous Hall Effect in 2D Half-Metallic VSe2/VN Heterostructure: Toward a Unified Spintronic-Valleytronic Platform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Chowdhury, Ahmed Zubair</p>
            <p>Rapid progress in valleytronics and spintronics is limited by the scarcity of two-dimensional materials that simultaneously provide robust valley splitting and strong spin selectivity. Here we showed that a van der Waals heterostructure (VSe2/VN) built from hexagonal VSe2 and hexagonal VN addressed this gap. Using first-principles density functional theory, phonon, ab initio molecular dynamics stability tests, Bader charge analysis, and Wannier-based Berry-curvature calculations, we demonstrated an energetically and dynamically stable heterostructure that exhibited interlayer charge transfer and a work function intermediate between the constituent monolayers. The electronic structure showed small indirect PBE gap (108.9 meV), with HSE06 indicating a half-metallic tendency; a sizable conduction-band valley splitting (\Delta CKK' = 22.9 meV for spin-up and \Delta CKK' = 61.3 meV for spin-down); and pronounced spin asymmetry, where the spin-down channel showed a wide semiconducting gap (0.64 eV) while the spin-up channel was nearly gapless. These features yielded a high zero-strain spin-filter efficiency P = 75.4%, tunable to 82.5% under +4% biaxial tensile strain. The heterostructure also supported non-zero, valley-contrasting Berry curvature, and a large anomalous Hall conductivity (peak sigmaxy = 568.33 S/cm). Importantly, mean-field estimation placed the ferromagnetic Curie temperature near room temperature at zero strain (Tc = 284.04 K), while Tc decreased to 183.9 K at +4% strain, the magnetic order remained robust to cryogenic temperatures, providing a beneficial tuning knob to balance spin-filter performance with thermal stability in device-relevant regimes. These results identified VSe2/VN as a practical, strain-tunable platform for integrated valleytronic, spintronic devices, and for exploring anomalous Hall and valley-dependent transport phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. A. Wadood, Shaurya Aarav, Kevin Liang, Jason W Fleischer</p>
            <p>Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2\pi/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.</p>

            <p>Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Er:YIG) holds the potential of combining the low magnetic damping of YIG with the telecom-band optical transitions of $\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions, making it a suitable material for hybrid optomagnonic devices and microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. We report the epitaxial growth of $\text{Er}_{x}\text{Y}_{3-x}\text{Fe}_{5}\text{O}_{12}$ films with $x=0.008-0.20$ on (111)-oriented gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction, reciprocal space mapping, and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm single-phase, fully coherent growth with atomically sharp interfaces across the entire substitution range. Magnetometry reveals a gradual decrease in saturation magnetization with increasing Er content, consistent with antiparallel coupling between Er$^{3+}$ spins and the net Fe$^{3+}$ moments, along with the emergence of an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The ferromagnetic resonance broadens with Er concentration due to increased Gilbert damping and inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. Films with low Er content ($x=0.008$), most relevant for optomagnonic applications, retain nearly isotropic magnetization and exhibit a damping parameter only slightly higher than that of undoped YIG. These results identify growth and substitution conditions that preserve YIG's low-loss magnetic properties while introducing optical functionality, establishing Er:YIG as a viable platform for hybrid quantum magnonics and microwave-to-optical transduction.</p>

            <h2>Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiguo Yin, A. M. Tsvelik</p>
            <p>The prohibition of finite-temperature phase transition in one-dimensional (1D) Ising models and 1D/2D quantum Heisenberg models with short-range interactions fundamentally constrains the application potentials of low-dimensional magnetic materials. Recently, ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), which can approach a transition at a desirable finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily closely, was discovered in 1D decorated Ising chains and ladders. Here we present a theoretical study of similarly decorated, yet much more challenging, quantum Heisenberg ferrimagnets in a magnetic field, which features ferromagnetic backbone exchange $J$, antiferromagnetic site-decoration coupling $J_{AF}$, and different magnetic moments for the backbone and decorating spins $\mu_aS_a<\mu_bS_b$. We exactly solved the model in the large $J$ limit -- as a central-macrospin model -- and found two finite-temperature second-order transitions; just above $T_{c2}$ a ``half-ice, half-fire'' regime appears. Finite-$J$ weak-field results follow from an effective-field mapping, suggesting the emergence of UNPC at finite $T_0$ in 2D square lattices thanks to its exponentially strong initial magnetic susceptibility $\chi_0\propto e^{4\pi S_a^2 J/T_0}$, though less likely in 1D chains where $\chi_0\propto J/T_0$. These results may shed light on new technological applications of low-dimensional quantum spin systems and attract experimental and computational tests.</p>

            <p>We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $\pi/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.</p>

            <p>One of the main residual limitations of inertial sensors based on atom interferometry stems from laser beam distortions, which cause parasitic phase shifts and non-homogeneous matter-light couplings. Here we present numerical simulations, accompanied by analytical calculations, which quantify the impact of these effects in a cold atom gradiometer. We demonstrate that the propagation of interferometric laser beam aberrations, combined with initial asymmetry and significant time-of-flight expansion of the the two atomic sources, limit the common-mode rejection of phase noise in a differential configuration. The resulting deviations in gravitational acceleration and its gradient are within reach of current experimental devices. Our study allows us to evaluate the surface quality requirements for retroreflective optics in cold-atom gradiometers of various baselines, and can be extended to other sensors based on different interferometer geometries.</p>

            <p>Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</p>

            <p>Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.</p>

            <h2>A Graphical Calculus for Quantum Computing with Multiple Qudits using Generalized Clifford Algebras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Lin</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a graphical calculus for multi-qudit computations with generalized Clifford algebras, building off the algebraic framework developed in our prior work. We build our graphical calculus out of a fixed set of graphical primitives defined by algebraic expressions constructed out of elements of a given generalized Clifford algebra, a graphical primitive corresponding to the ground state, and also graphical primitives corresponding to projections onto the ground state of each qudit. We establish many properties of the graphical calculus using purely algebraic methods, including a novel algebraic proof of a Yang-Baxter equation and a construction of a corresponding braid group representation. Our algebraic proof, which applies to arbitrary qudit dimension, also enables a resolution of an open problem of Cobanera and Ortiz on the construction of self-dual braid group representations for even qudit dimension. We also derive several new identities for the braid elements, which are key to our proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in many cases, the verification of involved vector identities can be reduced to the combinatorial application of two basic vector identities. Additionally, in terms of quantum computation, we demonstrate that it is feasible to envision implementing the braid operators for quantum computation, by showing that they are 2-local operators. In fact, these braid elements are almost Clifford gates, for they normalize the generalized Pauli group up to an extra factor $\zeta$, which is an appropriate square root of a primitive root of unity.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) are respectively the state-of-the-art quantum and classical computing methods for understanding many-body quantum systems. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that integrates these two methods, inheriting their distinct features in efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states and overcoming their limitations. We first introduce non-stoquasticity indicators (NSIs) and their upper bounds, which measure the sign problem, the most notable limitation of QMC. We show that our algorithm could greatly mitigate the sign problem, which decreases NSIs with the assistance of quantum computing. Meanwhile, the use of quantum Monte Carlo also increases the expressivity of shallow quantum circuits, allowing more accurate computation that is conventionally achievable only with much deeper circuits. We numerically test and verify the method for the N$_2$ molecule (12 qubits) and the Hubbard model (16 qubits). Our work paves the way to solving practical problems with intermediate-scale and early-fault tolerant quantum computers, with potential applications in chemistry, condensed matter physics, materials, high energy physics, etc.</p>

            <p>Random ensembles of pure states have proven to be extremely important in various aspects of quantum physics such as benchmarking the performance of quantum circuits, testing for quantum advantage, providing novel insights for many-body thermalization and studying the black hole information paradox. Although generating a fully random ensemble is experimentally challenging, approximations of it are just as useful and are known to emerge naturally in a variety of physical models, including Rydberg setups. These are referred to as approximate quantum state designs, and verifying their degree of randomness can be an expensive task, similar to performing full quantum state tomography on many-body systems. In this theoretical work, we efficiently validate the character of approximate quantum designs with respect to data size acquisition when compared to the conventional frequentist approach. This is achieved by translating the information residing in the complex many-body state into a succinct representation of classical data using a random projective measurement basis, which is then processed using methods of statistical inference such as maximum likelihood estimation and neural networks and benchmarked against the predictions of shadow tomography.

            <h2>Multipartite Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks using Subgraph Complementations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniruddha Sen, Kenneth Goodenough, Don Towsley</p>
            <p>Quantum networks are important for quantum communication, enabling tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and quantum error correction, often utilizing graph states, a specific class of multipartite entangled states that can be represented by graphs. We propose a novel approach for distributing graph states across a quantum network. We show that the distribution of graph states can be characterized by a system of subgraph complementations, which we also relate to the minimum rank of the underlying graph and the degree of entanglement quantified by the Schmidt-rank of the quantum state. We analyze resource usage for our algorithm and show that it improves on the number of qubits, bits for classical communication, and EPR pairs utilized, as compared to prior work. In fact, the number of local operations and resource consumption for our approach scales linearly in the number of vertices. This produces a quadratic improvement in completion time for several classes of graph states represented by dense graphs, which translates into an exponential improvement by allowing parallelization of gate operations. This leads to improved fidelities in the presence of noisy operations, as we show through simulation in the presence of noisy operations. We classify common classes of graph states, along with their optimal distribution time using subgraph complementations. We find a sequence of subgraph complementation operations to distribute an arbitrary graph state which we conjecture is close to the optimal sequence, and establish upper bounds on distribution time along with providing approximate greedy algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Zero-error communication under discrete-time Markovian dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satvik Singh, Mizanur Rahaman, Nilanjana Datta</p>
            <p>Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics 'scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Topologically protected negative entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Tan Xue, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from topologically protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems, especially for flat-band edge states. Departing from previous literature which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems. Gapless 2D flat-band edge states, however, exhibit novel $S_A\sim -\frac{1}{2}L_y^2\log L$ entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension $L_y$, independent of system parameters. This dramatically negative scaling can be traced to a new mechanism known as non-Hermitian critical skin compression (nHCSC), where topological and skin localization in one direction produces a hierarchy of extensively many probability non-conserving entanglement eigenstates across a cut in another direction. Our discovery sheds light on new avenues where topology interplays with criticality and non-Hermitian localization, unrelated to traditional notions of topological entanglement entropy. This topologically protected negative entanglement also manifests in the second Rényi entropy, which can be measured through SWAP operator expectation values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joy Ghosh, Shailendra K. Varshney, Kapil Debnath</p>
            <p>Destructive interference-based photon-phonon antibunching can lead to violations of classical inequalities in optomechanical cavity systems. In this paper, we explore the violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by examining second-order auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions, as well as Bell's nonlocality, to analyze the quantum correlations of single photon-phonon excitations when the system is driven by two weak probe fields. We propose that the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can serve as an indicator for the stronger nonclassical tests associated with Bell's theorem. Our system reveals strong quantum correlations of photon-phonon pairs with distinctive antidiagonal patterns of photon filtering. For numerical analysis, we consider a weak effective optomechanical coupling strength and various optical-to-mechanical field amplitude ratios that enable unconventional photon (phonon) blockades at resonance. The findings are significant for producing sub-Poissonian signals under optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for generating on-demand single photon-phonon pairs.</p>

            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.</p>

            <p>There are possible physical theories that give greater violations of Bell's inequalities than the corresponding Tsirelson bound, termed post-quantum non-locality. Such theories do not violate special relativity, but could give an advantage in certain information processing tasks. There is another way in which entangled quantum states exhibit non-classical phenomena, with one notable example being Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering; a violation of a bipartite Bell inequality implies EPR steering, but the converse is not necessarily true. The study of post-quantum EPR steering is more intricate, but it has been shown that it does not always imply post-quantum non-locality in a conventional Bell test. In this work we show how to distribute resources in a larger network that individually do not demonstrate post-quantum non-locality but violate a Tsirelson bound for the network. That is, we show how to activate post-quantum steering so that it can now be witnessed as post-quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. One element of our work that may be of independent interest is we show how to self-test a bipartite quantum assemblage in a network, even assuming post-quantum resources.</p>

            <p>While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</p>

            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing as few as five atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurement. The system is conveniently scalable, as newly added atoms naturally couple with existing ones via the shared cavity field. To achieve high computational expressivity with a minimal reservoir, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its internal quantum hardware, while polynomial regression nonlinearly enhances output resolution. We demonstrate significant QRC performance in memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsh Gupta, Mainak Bhattacharyya, Ritik Jain, Ankur Raina</p>
            <p>The reliability of quantum computation critically depends on the performance of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), which can be severely degraded by hook errors that reduce the effective code distance. In this work, we construct a family of $[[n,1,3]]$ non-CSS QECCs to achieve fault-tolerant (FT) syndrome measurement, where $ 6 \leq n \leq 10$. We employ the bare-ancilla method of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} to demonstrate fault tolerance in the presence of hook errors during syndrome extraction. We present a systematic protocol for generating these QECCs using graph codes. Using a custom lookup-table decoder, we simulate the code's performance under both anisotropic and circuit-level depolarizing noise. Our results reveal a trade-off in performance with respect to the code rate and identify optimized codes under these noise models. We benchmark our results against the infamous flag-qubit method of Chao \emph{et al.}. Notably, we introduce a code with improved code rate while maintaining the same distance as the work of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} Our approach facilitates the identification and construction of a family of distance three FT non-CSS QECCs.</p>

In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.</p>

Our approach maintains a constant distillation rate equal to the code rate while requiring no additional overhead beyond the physical qubits of the code. Full circuit-level analysis demonstrates fault-tolerance for input Bell pair infidelities below a threshold $\sim 10\%$, readily achievable with near-term capabilities. Unlike previous proposals, our scheme keeps the output Bell pairs encoded in qLDPC codes at each node, eliminating un-encoding overhead and enabling direct use in distributed quantum applications through recent advances in qLDPC computation. These results establish qLDPC-based distillation as a practical route toward resource-efficient quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of Lüders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</p>

            <p>We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system and are applicable to both near-term and large-scale quantum processors.</p>

Crucially, we show how to efficiently optimize multicopy witnesses to desired states, which is a current challenge. As an example of both theoretical and experimental interest, existing trace polynomial witnesses are significantly improved while preserving their symmetries and implementability with randomized measurements. Besides detecting entanglement, we also find new witnesses detecting $k$-copy distillability. A recipe for the single-copy case is shown to be effective for generic and Werner states.</p>

            <p>Seismic inversion-including post-stack, pre-stack, and full waveform inversion is compute and memory-intensive. Recently, several approaches, including physics-informed machine learning, have been developed to address some of these limitations. Motivated by the potential of quantum computing, we report on our attempt to map one such classical physics-informed algorithm to a quantum framework. The primary goal is to investigate the technical challenges of this mapping, given that quantum algorithms rely on computing principles fundamentally different from those in classical computing. Quantum computers operate using qubits, which exploit superposition and entanglement, offering the potential to solve classically intractable problems. While current quantum hardware is limited, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms-particularly in quantum machine learning (QML)-demonstrate potential for near-term applications and can be readily simulated. We apply QML to subsurface imaging through the development of a hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQ-PINN) for post-stack and pre-stack seismic inversion. The HQ-PINN architecture adopts an encoder-decoder structure: a hybrid quantum neural network encoder estimates P- and S-impedances from seismic data, while the decoder reconstructs seismic responses using geophysical relationships. Training is guided by minimizing the misfit between the input and reconstructed seismic traces. We systematically assess the impact of quantum layer design, differentiation strategies, and simulator backends on inversion performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through the inversion of both synthetic and the Sleipner field datasets. The HQ-PINN framework consistently yields accurate results, showcasing quantum computing's promise for geosciences and paving the way for future quantum-enhanced geophysical workflows.</p>

Additionally, we implement a QNN integrated with quantum communication and evaluate its performance to quantify the overhead introduced by noisy quantum channels, and the communication overhead was found to be modest.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj</p>
            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the primary methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work presents a detailed theoretical investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an emitter in a doubly resonant cavity. The system is modeled by the Lindblad master Equation, and an approximate analytical solution is derived to determine the experimentally achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. Additionally, the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits are also identified. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency is approximately 35%, which is significantly higher than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Mandel Q parameter, revealing highly bunched two-photon emission and super-Poissonian statistics. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and its spectrum consists of three prominent peaks corresponding to transitions between the dressed states of the system.</p>

            <p>Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</p>

Using a resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect significant shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously, which is a direct manifestation of physics beyond the hitherto explored regime of cavity-cold atom interaction with only single or few longitudinal modes at a time. For the cavity mode closest to the atomic resonance, we demonstrate a bistability in the transmission spectrum, arising due to a combined coupling of the cloud to an external pump laser and a cavity mode probed by the optical frequency comb. These results establish a platform for deeper exploration of multifrequency cavity quantum electrodynamics, where ultrashort pulsed sources can be used for optical manipulation, cooling and entanglement of cold atoms in a resonator.</p>

            <p>As quantum computing progresses towards the early fault-tolerant regime, quantum error correction will play a crucial role in protecting qubits and enabling logical Clifford operations. However, the number of logical qubits will initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks like magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient methods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle rotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these constraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an approach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error mitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded magic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. We identify evolution time regimes where MMD outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis techniques in the number of noisy encoded magic states required for square lattices up to size $8 \times 8$. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage that is quantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements for small-angle rotations over classical simulators. This work paves the way for early fault-tolerant demonstrations on devices supporting millions of quantum operations, the so-called MegaQuOp regime.</p>

            <p>These notes present a review of the status of quantum computing with arrays of neutral atom qubits, an approach which has demonstrated remarkable progress in the last few years. Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes. Extending Rydberg interactions to multiple atomic species has emerged as a promising route to achieving this latter requirement.</p>

            <p>The advent of hybrid computing platforms consisting of quantum processing units integrated with conventional high-performance computing brings new opportunities for algorithm design. By strategically offloading select portions of the workload to classical hardware where tractable, we may broaden the applicability of quantum computation in the near term. In this perspective, we review techniques that facilitate the study of subdomains of chemical systems with quantum computers and present a proof-of-concept demonstration of quantum-selected configuration interaction deployed within a multiscale/multiphysics simulation workflow leveraging classical molecular dynamics, projection-based embedding and qubit subspace tools. This allows the technology to be utilised for simulating systems of real scientific and industrial interest, which not only brings true quantum utility closer to realisation but is also relevant as we look forward to the fault-tolerant regime.</p>

            <h2>Fast and High Excitation Transport in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Tang Yu, I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana, Wei Chen, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of few subradiant right eigenstates that are spectrally isolated and spatially localized in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights into quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Bending Hyperplanes, Nonlinear Entanglement Witnesses via Envelopes of Linear Witnesses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> AmirHossein Tangestaninejad, Vahid Karimipour</p>
            <p>Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting entanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most of the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear entanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over continuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This procedure effectively "bends" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses into curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled states. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive semi-definiteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a hierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this construction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally to arbitrary Positive but not Completely Positive (PnCP) maps, leading to nonlinear analogues of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the required measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear criteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local operator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in detecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the construction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant enhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Testing Distinguishability and Determinism in Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark G. Raizen</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze experiments to test distinguishability and determinism in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if atoms are distinguishable from each other due to small differences in the nuclear magnetic moment. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for stable isotopes that are confined to ion traps, by accumulating statistics over time with different atoms. The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number of protons and neutrons. We then consider the possibility of performing the same tests on newly created stable isotopes. We also propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of thulium-170 is considered, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.</p>

Performing state measurements in a 3D cooling configuration enables repeated low loss measurements.

Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces. This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that leverages modern neural architectures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Sensing with Bright Two-Mode Squeezed Light in a Distributed Network of Gyroscopes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyanka M. Kannath, Girish S. Agarwal, Ashok Kumar</p>
            <p>Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>On the Design of Expressive and Trainable Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Xiao Tao, Xin Wang, Re-Bing Wu</p>
            <p>Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that avoids barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving trainability. We establish a necessary condition pertaining to the system's initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings provide a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that balance expressivity and trainability.</p>

            <h2>Mutually equi-biased bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Javad Akhtarshenas, Saman Karimi, Mahdi Salehi</p>
            <p>In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one basis gives \emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another basis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes to be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution $q=(q_0,\ldots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is preserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any preparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is chosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect to the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of this, we define the notion of \emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such that within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of the other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to each other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual equi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading for $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\le\mu \le 1/2$ where $\mu=\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements in MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective measurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty inequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated entanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed from MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same number of bases, for certain values of the index $\mu$, employing a larger set of MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic states of a $3\times 3$ system. Our results reveal that not all bases in a set of $L$ MEBs can have contribution for the entanglement detection. ...</p>

            <p>Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs) offer a physically grounded approach to secure authentication, extending the capabilities of classical PUFs. This review covers their theoretical foundations and key implementation challenges - such as quantum memories and Haar-randomness -, and distinguishes QPUFs from Quantum Readout PUFs (QR-PUFs), more experimentally accessible yet less robust against quantum-capable adversaries. A co-citation-based selection method is employed to trace the evolution of QPUF architectures, from early QR-PUFs to more recent Hybrid PUFs (HPUFs). This method further supports a discussion on the role of information-theoretic analysis in mitigating inconsistencies in QPUF responses, underscoring the deep connection between secret-key generation and authentication. Despite notable advances, achieving practical and robust QPUF-based authentication remains an open challenge.</p>

            <p>Operating superconducting qubits at elevated temperatures offers increased cooling power and thus system scalability, but requires suppression of thermal photons to preserve coherence and readout fidelity. This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20~GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</p>

            <h2>Error exponents of quantum state discrimination with composite correlated hypotheses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Fang, Masahito Hayashi</p>
            <p>We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and identically distributed case to encompass composite correlated hypotheses. In particular, we introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their equivalence or quantitative relations. In the error exponent regime, we generalize the quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum states, demonstrating that the optimal Type-I error exponent, under an exponential constraint on the Type-II error, is precisely characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong converse exponent regime, we provide a general lower bound on the exponent in terms of the regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence and a matching upper bound when the null hypothesis is a singleton. The generality of these results enables applications in various contexts, including (i) refining the generalized quantum Stein's lemma by [Fang, Fawzi & Fawzi, 2024]; (ii) exhibiting counterexamples to the continuity of the regularized Petz Rényi divergence and Hoeffding divergence; (iii) obtaining error exponents for adversarial channel discrimination and resource detection problems.</p>

Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangjing Dong, Fengning Ou, Penghui Yao</p>
            <p>Shallow quantum circuits have attracted increasing attention in recent years, due to the fact that current noisy quantum hardware can only perform faithful quantum computation for a short amount of time. The constant-depth quantum circuits $\mathbf{QAC}^0$, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits, are the polynomial-size and constant-depth quantum circuits composed of only single-qubit unitaries and polynomial-size generalized Toffoli gates. The computational power of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we are concerned with $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ circuits, which are linear-size $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{LC}^0$. * We show that depth-$d$ $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits working on $n$ input qubits and $a$ ancilla qubits have approximate degree at most $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-2^{-d}})$, improving the $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-3^{-d}})$ degree upper bound of previous works. Consequently, this directly implies that to compute the parity function, $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits need at least $\tilde{O}(n^{1+2^{-d}})$ circuit size. * We present the first agnostic learning algorithm for $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channels using subexponential running time and queries. Moreover, we also establish exponential lower bounds on the query complexity of learning $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ channels under both the spectral norm distance of the Choi matrix and the diamond norm distance. * We present a tolerant testing algorithm which determines whether an unknown quantum channel is a $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channel. This tolerant testing algorithm is based on our agnostic learning algorithm. Our approach leverages low-degree approximations of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits and Pauli analysis as key technical tools. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of agnostic learning for shallow quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</p>

            <p>One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently samplable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In this setting we can hope to construct efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verification of classical/quantum distributions with classical/quantum cryptography, showing the following results: (1). Classically efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable if and only if one-way functions do not exist. (2). Quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable by $\mathbf{P}^\mathbf{PP}$ with a polynomial number of samples. (3). Sampling-based quantum advantage can be verified quantumly (with a polynomial number of samples) if one-way puzzles do not exist. (4). If QEFID pairs exist, then some quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are not verifiable.</p>

The algorithm utilises the reconfigurability of the integrated photonic circuits to complete one iteration of phase stabilisation in just two measurement rounds for an arbitrary number of modes, and requires no additional hardware to the quantum measurements it enables. As a result, we are able to perform complete quantum state tomography across two chips using the minimum number of local projective measurements to verify the fidelity of the distributed entangled state to be 86% (compared to 8.1% without the phase stabilisation) with an entanglement entropy of 0.995+/-0.002.</p>

            <h2>On Encoding Matrices using Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liron Mor Yosef, Haim Avron</p>
            <p>Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations. Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b) low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli matrices.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Mollabashi, Mohammad-Javad Vasli</p>
            <p>We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung-Hsuan Teh, Takahiro Orito</p>
            <p>We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

            <h2>A No-Go Theorem for Shaping Quantum Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Alperin</p>
            <p>The ability to engineer non-Gaussian quantum resources underlies quantum technologies from communication and metrology to universal computation. However, while a number of canonical works have set no-go limits for attaining such resources from Gaussian operations, it is widely assumed that such resources can be tuned freely by non-Gaussian Hamiltonian dynamics. Here we prove a general no-go theorem for such resource shaping: no smooth Hamiltonian dynamics can modify higher-order statistical moments of a continuous-variable state without simultaneously changing its mean and covariance. This analytic constraint implies a rigidity theorem for Hamiltonian quantum control-only quadratic (symplectic) generators preserve the Gaussian moment hierarchy, while every non-quadratic term necessarily couples the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. The theorem identifies the symplectic algebra as the unique invariant subalgebra whose differential representations terminate at finite (second) order within the otherwise infinite Hamiltonian algebra. It thereby defines the analytic boundary between classically simulable Gaussian dynamics and the fully universal non-Gaussian regime-the continuous-variable analogue of the Gottesman-Knill frontier.</p>

            <h2>High-fidelity all-microwave CZ gate with partial erasure-error detection via a transmon coupler</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shotaro Shirai, Shinichi Inoue, Shuhei Tamate, Rui Li, Yasunobu Nakamura, Atsushi Noguchi</p>
            <p>Entangling gates between neighboring physical qubits are essential for quantum error correction. Implementing them in an all-microwave manner simplifies signal routing and control apparatus of superconducting quantum processors. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-microwave controlled-Z (CZ) gate that achieves high fidelity while suppressing residual ZZ interactions. Our approach utilizes a fixed-frequency transmon coupler and multi-path coupling, thereby sufficiently reducing the net transverse interaction between data transmons to suppress residual ZZ interactions. The controlled phase arises from the dispersive frequency shift of the $|gf\rangle$$\unicode{x2013}$$|eg\rangle$ transition between the coupler and one of the data transmons conditioned on the state of the other data transmon. Driving the transitions at the midpoint of two dispersively shifted resonance frequencies induces state-dependent geometric phases to achieve the CZ gate. Crucially, with this scheme, we can maintain a small net transverse interaction between two data transmons while increasing the coupling between the data and coupler transmons to accelerate the CZ-gate speed. Additionally, we measure the coupler state after the gate to detect a subset of decoherence-induced failures that occur during the gate operation. These events constitute erasure errors with known locations, enabling erasure-aware quantum error-correcting codes to improve future logical qubit performance.</p>

            <h2>Qubit Mapping and Routing tailored to Advanced Quantum ISAs: Not as Costly as You Think</h2>

            <p>Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-CX-unrolled SWAP insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported by physical devices. Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard CX-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as SQiSW and ZZ({\theta}) gates offer superior circuit synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However, systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are lacking. To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit canonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost for more intelligent SWAP insertion during the routing stage. We also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based optimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing overhead by 15%-35% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different ISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayang Niu, Yan Wang, Jie Li, Ke Deng, Azadeh Alavi, Mark Sanderson, Yongli Ren</p>
            <p>Designing expressive yet trainable quantum circuit architectures remains a major challenge for variational quantum algorithms, as manual or heuristic designs often yield suboptimal performance. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified framework that integrates discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within a hybrid action space. Unlike existing approaches that optimize circuit structure and parameters separately, HyRLQAS jointly learns both topology and initialization while dynamically refining previously placed gates through reinforcement learning. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) environment, the agent autonomously constructs circuits that minimize molecular ground-state energy. Experimental results demonstrate that HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower energy errors and more compact circuit structures compared with discrete-only and continuous-only baselines. Furthermore, the hybrid action space yields superior parameter initializations, producing post-optimization energy distributions with consistently lower minima. These findings suggest that hybrid-action reinforcement learning offers a principled pathway toward automated and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Mudholkar, Chiranjeevi Vanarasa, Indranil Chakrabarty, Srinathan Kannan</p>
            <p>The problem of revocation of quantum states after sharing is interesting and we ask: Is it possible for a dealer to revoke the state once shared, before the reconstruction process? Additional resources like bell states are used to help the dealer to get back the state. In a three-party scenario, we show an independent way to revoke, if, for any reason, the dealer is not sure about the intention of the/any reconstructor. In general, the classical outcomes of the dealer in sharing phase are needed, to be able to reconstruct the state perfectly. When both the shareholders are dishonest, and without the dealer's knowledge, collude to reconstruct, they always have some chance of succeeding. This is addressed by giving more control to the dealer by making him/her) to have a quantum share as well. We give a sharing and revocation protocol with a four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the dealer and one each with the shareholders). We further consider a class of four qubit pure entangled states as resource and explicitly find the range of parameters for which the protocol will be successful.</p>

We measure the absorption spectrum between the $^{3}H_{6}$ - $^{3}F_{4}$ and $^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds, the inhomogeneous broadening of the $^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ (excited-state) ZPL, and the lifetimes of the higher-lying and lower-lying excited states. We also investigate spectral hole-burning spectra with varying magnetic fields, which provides insight into hyperfine and superhyperfine interactions. Using again spectral holes but also optical free induction decays (FIDs), we assess optical coherence times, finding a maximum of 1.1 $\mu s$ when a 2T magnetic field is applied. Our results -- the first to demonstrate coherence of an excited-state transition in a rare-earth crystal -- suggest the possibility of exploiting such transitions for quantum technology.</p>

            <h2>On the success probability of the quantum algorithm for the short DLP</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Ekerå</p>
            <p>Ekerå and Håstad have introduced a variation of Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). Unlike Shor's original algorithm, Ekerå-Håstad's algorithm solves the short DLP in groups of unknown order. In this work, we prove a lower bound on the probability of Ekerå-Håstad's algorithm recovering the short logarithm $d$ in a single run. By our bound, the success probability can easily be pushed as high as $1 - 10^{-10}$ for any short $d$. A key to achieving such a high success probability is to efficiently perform a limited search in the classical post-processing by leveraging meet-in-the-middle techniques. Asymptotically, in the limit as the bit length $m$ of $d$ tends to infinity, the success probability tends to one if the limits on the search space are parameterized in $m$. Our results are directly applicable to Diffie-Hellman in safe-prime groups with short exponents, and to RSA via a reduction from the RSA integer factoring problem (IFP) to the short DLP.</p>

Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems.

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</p>

The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is encoded in a specific microscopic pattern of density waves and phase excitations that can be addressed within the experimental cold atoms capabilities. This work paves the way for tunable amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing. At the same time, our analysis provides the microscopic explanation of the general notion of parametric amplification occurring in nonlinear coherent devices.</p>

            <p>We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent $z$. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of Krylov complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values of the Lanczos coefficients dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems. We further find that increasing the Lifshitz exponent $z$ suppresses Krylov complexity, entropy, and Lanczos growth in both massless and massive cases, while enhancing K-variance. This trend reverses under a hard UV cutoff, where complexity and entropy increase with $z$. In lattice models, early-time complexity and $b_n$ decay shift with $z$, echoing the continuum behavior of massive and massless regimes.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance.</p>

Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches.

            <p>Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</p>

The H$_2^+$ ions are produced from residual gas and sympathetically cooled by a co-trapped, laser-cooled $^9$Be$^+$ ion. By tuning the wavelength of the REMPI laser, we observe the loading of single H$_2^+$ ions via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 0, 1, 2, 3$) rovibrational levels of the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ intermediate state. We measure the success probability for the production of H$_2^+$ in the ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 1$) state via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 1$) level to be 85(6)% by quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) of the hyperfine structure of this rovibrational state. Furthermore, we load an H$_2^+$ ion via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 2$) level and confirm its rovibrational state to be ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 2$) by QLS. We perform QLS probes on the ion over 19 h and observe no decay of the rotationally excited state.

The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</p>

            <h2>Bell-State Quantum Holography with Metasurfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinmiao Chen, Guangzhou Geng, Hong Liang, Wai Chun Wong, Tailin An, Randy Stefan Tanuwijaya, Junjie Li, Jensen Li</p>
            <p>Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.</p>

            <p>We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom R. Hepworth, Simon L. Cornish, Philip D. Gregory</p>
            <p>Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p>Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a trapped-ion protocol in which a nearby, dedicated "monitor" qubit tracks magnetic-field drifts in real time without interrupting data-qubit operations. Using two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ions and the optical--metastable--ground architecture, we encode the data qubit in the ground-state manifold and the monitor qubit in a metastable-state manifold to achieve spectral separation. The monitor qubit senses common magnetic fluctuations during data-qubit experiments, enabling feedforward corrections to the qubit-control drives. Under applied magnetic noise with a realistic spectrum ($1/f^{2}$), the protocol maintains coherence and, when compared with interleaved calibration, it extends usable data-qubit probe times by up to a factor of ${\sim}\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the experimental duty cycle. These results establish monitor qubits as a scalable tool for real-time recalibration in quantum information processors.</p>

            <h2>Ballistic bosonic noise suppression with hybrid qumode-qubit rotation gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurabh U. Shringarpure, Siheon Park, Sungjoo Cho, Yong Siah Teo, Hyukjoon Kwon, Srikrishna Omkar, Hyunseok Jeong</p>
            <p>Noise suppression is of paramount importance for reliable quantum information processing and computation. We show that for any single-mode bosonic code (qumode) corrupted by thermal~noise at rate~$\eta$ and mean \mbox{excitation}~$\bar{n}$, a hybrid continuous-discrete-variable~(CV-DV) interferometer using only a single qubit ancilla~(DV) and two controlled~Fourier~(CF) gates sandwiching the noise channel suppresses its effects to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$ \emph{without} any active error correction or destructive measurements of the encoded state and with high success probabilities~$>0.5$ if~$\eta(1+\bar{n})<0.5$. This suppression scheme works by conditionally monitoring the photon-number parities after the interferometer. Bosonic codes with two logical states of the same photon-number parity (like-parity codes) are \emph{completely resilient} to DV amplitude- and phase-damping ancilla noise. For such codes, the interferometer simplifies to the use of a qumode rotation gate and a \emph{single} CF~gate. This presents a clear advantage of our CF-gate-based error suppression scheme over previously-proposed ``bypass'' protocols, where qubit information transferred to the DV mode is readily corrupted by damping~noise. Finally, we present a simple extension to direct communication of qumode states between two parties over a noisy channel using a preshared DV entangled state, by implementing a CF gate in the first laboratory and its inverse in the other. Such a communication protocol achieves a similar fidelity performance at the same success rate as the single-party case, but with greater resilience to the ancilla noise than DV~teleportation. Resource-efficient multi-qubit codes that depend on a few essential long-range interactions can benefit from it.</p>

            <p>Scaling of quantum gates remains a central challenge in quantum information science. Ultrafast gates based on spin-dependent kicks provide a promising approach for trapped-ion systems. However, these gates require laser pulses with both high temporal tunability and stability, which are difficult to achieve with existing pulsed sources. Here, we propose a programmable pulsed source that allows flexible control of pulse intensity, waveform, and phase profiles. This enables precise manipulation of pulse sequences, thereby improving the fidelity of entangling gates. Furthermore, since the pulse parameters can be conveniently tuned, various coherent population-transfer schemes can be implemented adiabatic SDKs, thereby improving both the fidelity and robustness of fast quantum gate. Simulation results show that our programmable pulse system can achieve gate fidelities above 99.99% with strong robustness against variations in pulse intensity and single-photon detuning using stimulated Raman adiabatic rapid passage (STIRARP) protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Tong Yang, Song-Ming Chen, Hong-Gang Luo</p>
            <p>The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system. Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$ satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states. Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.</p>

            <p>In a system where two identical two-level atoms interact with their common one-mode cavity field, it is shown that entanglement can become abruptly frozen in time, remaining at a constant value for a period of time until it begins to thaw from this value from the entanglement sharing perspective [Ding et al., Phys. Rev. A 103, 032418 (2021)]. We generalize this exotic behavior of entanglement sharing dynamics to more general systems with arbitrary N qubits, instead of restricting to the atom-cavity mode interaction system. We also demonstrate methods to control the entanglement freezing time and freezing value, and we discover a nontrivial dynamics where entanglement is frozen permanently. In addition, we show that this phenomenon is not a coincidence but a universal feature in a variety of systems with a geometric explanation of the mechanisms.</p>

The double-click approach relaxes the phase stability requirement but is strongly affected by finite efficiencies. Choosing the optimal protocol thus depends on the access to the phase stabilization as well as the efficiency of interface of the ions and ensemble-based memories.</p>

In this paper, we focus on several classes of Gaussian channels associated with quantum steering: Gaussian steering-annihilating channels, Gaussian steering-breaking channels, Gaussian unsteerable channels, and maximal Gaussian unsteerable channels. We give the concepts of these channels, derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Gaussian channel to belong to each class, and explore the intrinsic relationships among them. Additionally, since quantifying the steering capability of Gaussian channels in continuous-variable systems requires an understanding of the structure of free superchannels, we also provide a detailed characterization of Gaussian unsteerable superchannels and maximal Gaussian unsteerable superchannels.</p>

            <p>Although multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terahertz (THz) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is theoretically secure, practical vulnerabilities may arise due to detector imperfections. This paper explores a CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD system operating at THz frequencies within a MIMO framework. In this system, measurement is delegated to an untrusted third party, Charlie, rather than the receiver, eliminating all detector attacks and significantly enhancing the system's practical security. Using transmit-receive beamforming techniques, the system transforms MIMO channels into multiple parallel lossy quantum channels, enabling robust key distribution between Alice and Bob. This study examines entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure protocols, deriving secret key rates for both asymptotic and finite code scenarios. Simulations reveal the critical role of multiple antenna configurations and efficient homodyne detection in mitigating free-space path loss and maximizing key rates. Results indicate that system performance is optimized at lower THz frequencies for long-range transmissions and higher frequencies for short-range applications. The proposed protocol offers a scalable solution for secure quantum communications in next-generation wireless networks, demonstrating potential for deployment in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p>

            <h2>Channel Superposition Mitigates Photon Loss Errors in Quantum Illumination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Li, Xiao-Wei Li, Oscar Dahlsten</p>
            <p>In quantum illumination, the probe photon is entangled with an ancilla photon, and both are jointly measured at the end. The entanglement between the probe and ancilla photons enhances the detection performance per unit average photon number in the probe mode, particularly in low-reflectivity and high-noise scenarios. However, photon loss severely limits the practical advantage of such protocols. To address this, we employ a channel superposition framework, which encompasses two kinds of channel superposition protocols: indefinite causal order (ICO) and path superposition with disjoint environment (PS-DE). Our analytical and numerical analysis based on the quantum Chernoff bound shows that both ICO and PS-DE can, in principle, achieve an advantage. The advantage persists as long as non-zero interference remains, reverting to the performance of standard quantum illumination once the interference is completely suppressed. Crucially, the ICO protocol is significantly more robust, maintaining a tighter upper bound on the error probability than standard quantum illumination and the PS-DE approach. This performance hierarchy is rooted in their fundamental structures: ICO exploits a shared environment to generate stronger quantum interference, while PS-DE, relying on disjoint environments, offers a more experimentally tractable albeit less potent alternative.</p>

            <h2>Robust Quantum Teleportation Against Noise Using Weak Measurement and Flip Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Dhanik, Shraddha Sharma, Pitamber Mahanandia</p>
            <p>This study presents an improved quantum teleportation protocol designed to enhance fidelity in noisy environments by combining weak measurements (WMs) with flip and reversal operations. In our scheme, Alice prepares a four-qubit entangled state and shares one of the entangled qubits with Bob, which serves as the quantum channel for teleporting an arbitrary single-qubit state. Since the communication channel is subject to noise, Alice performs a weak measurement on the shared qubit before transmission to reduce the impact of decoherence. Building upon existing WM-flip-reversal frameworks, we propose a modified weak measurement and reversal (WMR) protocol tailored for different noises in a four-qubit entangled system. The approach applies WM and flip operations prior to transmission to enhance resilience against noise, followed by corresponding reversal operations after transmission to recover the original quantum state. We systematically compare the performance of our proposed WMR protocol with the previously proposed WM-flip-reversal method under three common noise models: amplitude damping channel (ADC), phase flip channel (PFC), and bit flip channel (BFC). Our analysis reveals that the modified WMR scheme achieves significantly higher teleportation fidelity and improved robustness, particularly in bit flip noise environments. These findings highlight the potential of optimized weak measurement strategies for developing more reliable and noise-tolerant quantum communication protocols.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhrumil Bhatt, Vidushi Kumar</p>
            <p>The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an \textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($\rho = 10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with network size and remains robust for fading variances up to $\sigma_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global quantum constellations.</p>

To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation.

            <p>The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide a tutorial treatise on the fundamental research challenges of quantum transduction. The tutorial is structured around a communications engineering framework, thereby shedding light on its fundamental role in quantum network design and deployment- a perspective often overlooked in existing literature. This framework allows us to categorize different transduction modalities and to reveal an unorthodox one where the transducer itself can act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</p>

            <h2>Architecting Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Computers using Surface Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Jones, Prakash Murali (University of Cambridge)</p>
            <p>Trapped ion (TI) qubits are a leading quantum computing platform. Current TI systems have less than 60 qubits, but a modular architecture known as the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) is a promising path to scale up devices. There is a large gap between the error rates of near-term systems ($10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) and the requirements of practical applications (below $10^{-9}$). To bridge this gap, we require Quantum Error Correction (QEC) to build logical qubits that are composed of multiple physical qubits. While logical qubits have been demonstrated on TI qubits, these demonstrations are restricted to small codes and systems. There is no clarity on how QCCD systems should be designed to implement practical-scale QEC. This paper studies how surface codes, a standard QEC scheme, can be implemented efficiently on QCCD-based systems. To examine how architectural parameters of a QCCD system can be tuned for surface codes, we develop a near-optimal topology-aware compilation method that outperforms existing QCCD compilers by an average of 3.8X in terms of logical clock speed. We use this compiler to examine how hardware trap capacity, connectivity and electrode wiring choices can be optimised for surface code implementation. In particular, we demonstrate that small traps of two ions are surprisingly ideal from both a performance-optimal and hardware-efficiency standpoint. This result runs counter to prior intuition that larger traps (20-30 ions) would be preferable, and has the potential to inform design choices for upcoming systems.</p>

            <p>We have developed a new version of the high-performance Jülich universal quantum computer simulator (JUQCS-50) that leverages key features of the GH200 superchips as used in the JUPITER supercomputer, enabling simulations of a 50-qubit universal quantum computer for the first time. JUQCS-50 achieves this through three key innovations: (1) extending usable memory beyond GPU limits via high-bandwidth CPU-GPU interconnects and LPDDR5 memory; (2) adaptive data encoding to reduce memory footprint with acceptable trade-offs in precision and compute effort; and (3) an on-the-fly network traffic optimizer. These advances result in an 11.4-fold speedup over the previous 48-qubit record on the K computer.</p>

            <p>The principle that heat spontaneously flows from higher temperature to lower temperature is a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, often assumed to be independent of the sequence of interactions. While this holds true for macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.</p>

            <h2>Temporal entanglement transition in chaotic quantum many-body dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilya Vilkoviskiy, Michael Sonner, Qi Camm Huang, Wen Wei Ho, Alessio Lerose, Dmitry A. Abanin</p>
            <p>Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</p>

            <h2>Realistic GKP stabilizer states enable universal quantum computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fariba Hosseinynejad, Pavithran Iyer, Guillaume Dauphinais, David L. Feder</p>
            <p>Physical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are inherently noisy as ideal ones would require infinite energy. While this is typically considered as a deficiency to be actively corrected, this work demonstrates that imperfect GKP stabilizer states can be leveraged in order to apply non-Clifford gates using only linear optical elements. In particular, Gaussian operations on normalizable GKP states, combined with homodyne measurements, permit two key primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates in the normalizable GKP codespace, thereby implementing Clifford gates with high fidelity; and probabilistic projection of unmeasured modes onto non-Pauli eigenstates. These results demonstrate that normalizable GKP stabilizer states combined with Gaussian operations provide a practical framework for computational universality within the measurement-based model of quantum computation in a realistic continuous-variable setting.</p>

            <h2>Controlled growth of rare-earth-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films on III-V semiconductors for hybrid quantum photonic interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry C. Hammer, Caleb Whittier, Nathan A. Helvy, Christopher Rouleau, Nabil D. Bassim, Ravitej Uppu</p>
            <p>Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough, polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum photonic chips.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mauricio Gutiérrez, Chiranjib Mukhopadhyay, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>For single-parameter sensing, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) probes achieve optimal quantum-enhanced precision across the unknown parameter range, solely relying on parameter-independent separable measurement strategies for all values of the unknown parameter. However, in the multiparameter setting, a single GHZ probe not only fails to achieve quantum advantage but also the corresponding optimal measurement becomes complex and dependent on the unknown parameters. Here, we provide a recipe for multiparameter sensing with GHZ probes using quantum error correction techniques by treating all but one unknown parameters as noise, whose effects can be corrected. This strategy restores the core advantage of single parameter GHZ-based quantum sensing, namely reaching optimally quantum-enhanced precision for all unknown parameter values while keeping the measurements separable and fixed. Specifically, given one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, our protocol extracts optimal possible precision for any probe size. While this optimal precision is shot-noise limited for a single GHZ probe, we recover the Heisenberg scaling through use of multiple complementary GHZ probes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol with Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <p>Quantum state discrimination, alongside its other applications, has recently found use as a tool for witnessing generalised contextuality. In this article, we derive noncontextuality inequalities for both conclusive and inconclusive outcomes across various guessing strategies. For minimum- error discrimination, the advantage is in terms of the confidences of individual outcomes, while for unambiguous state discrimination, it is in terms of the average guessing probability. For maximum- confidence discrimination, we show that contextual advantages occur not only for the confidence but also their average, the guessing probability, as well as the inconclusive outcome rate. Our results unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and figures of merit. We envisage that various quantum information applications based on state discrimination may offer advantages over non-contextual theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke-Xiong Yan, Zhi-Cheng Shi, Ye-Hong Chen, Yan Xia</p>
            <p>Pure dephasing is the dominant leak mechanism in photonic cat qubits because its phase errors disrupt the parity protection, rendering the qubit vulnerable to energy relaxation. In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing mechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces \textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and odd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the dynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby transforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for probing non-Hermitian physics. Within this platform, we demonstrate the possibility to control the parity-time symmetry phase transition in a single cat qubit by adjusting its amplitude. Moreover, we couple two cat qubits to realize an entanglement phase transition induced by the exceptional point. Our work constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator, overturning the conventional paradigm that treats dephasing as harmful noise.</p>

            <p>We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Chip Co-Design for Fidelity and Entanglement Preservation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Salmanogli, Hesam Zandi</p>
            <p>This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <p>While geometric quantum gates are often theorized to possess intrinsic resilience to control errors by exploiting the global properties of evolution paths, this promise has not consistently translated into practical robustness. We present a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) that incorporates additional auxiliary constraints to suppress dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance. Within this framework, we also design NGQGs using noncyclic paths, offering enhanced design flexibility. Implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, our scheme realizes high-fidelity single-qubit gates that are robust against Rabi amplitude error $\epsilon$, with infidelity scaling as $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ behavior of conventional dynamical gates. We further analyze two-qubit NGQGs under parametric driving. Our results identify subtle limitations that compromise performance in two-qubit scenarios, underscoring the importance of phase compensation and waveform calibration. The demonstrated simplicity and generality of our super-robust NGQG scheme make it applicable across diverse quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehor Hudenko, Michal Kolář, Radim Filip, Artem Ryabov</p>
            <p>Local quantum coherence in a two-level system (TLS) is typically generated via time-dependent driving. However, it can also emerge autonomously from symmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment at a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting atoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating the autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this gap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS coupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the whole system being in thermal equilibrium. We show that the local coherence not only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures of the environment compared to the case of no inter-source interactions. The temperature dependence of the coherence bears signatures of a quantum phase transition, and our analytical results suggest strategies for its optimization. Our findings reveal generic properties of the autonomously generated quantum coherence and point to viable routes for observing the coherence at nonzero temperatures.</p>

            <p>We investigate the implementation of photonic cluster state generation protocols using quantum metasurfaces comprising sub-wavelength atomic arrays which enables quantum-controlled reflectivity. These cluster states are generated using fundamental quantum logic gates and enable wide-ranging applications in quantum computation and communication. In the past few years, certain protocols have been developed, but their physical realizations induces natural losses on the system mainly originated from coupling the photonic structures, setting a limit on the efficiency and maximal qubit number. In this paper, we examine a physical implementation of two specific protocols for generating distinct cluster states: a two-dimensional cluster state and a tree cluster state. Our approach leverages the unique properties of a quantum metasurface and its free space settings to implement two-qubit quantum-logic gates, namely CNOT, CZ, and E gates, with practical fidelities exceeding 0.9, and potential speed-up due to parallelism. In addition, we analyze these protocols fidelities for practical conditions of potential implementation experiments, such as thermal fluctuation of trapped atoms.</p>

            <p>Adiabatic geometric phase gates offer enhanced robustness against fluctuations compared to con- ventional Rydberg blockade-based phase gates that rely on dynamical phase accumulation. We theoretically demonstrate two- and multi-qubit phase gates in a neutral atom architecture, relying on a double stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence that imprints a controllable geometric phase on the qubit systems. The system is designed in such a way that every atom is individually addressable, and moreover, no extra laser is required to be applied on the target atom while scaling up the system from two- to multi-qubit quantum gates. The gate fidelity has been numerically analyzed by changing the gate operation time, and we find that 98% to 99% fidelity can be achieved for gate time $\simeq$ 0.6 $\mu$s. We perform a systematic error analysis, which re- veals that our proposed gates can exhibit strong resilience against fluctuations in Rabi frequencies, finite blockade strength, and atomic position variations. These results establish our approach as a physically feasible and scalable pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation with neutral atoms. We simulate Grover's search algorithm for two-, three-, and four-qubit systems with high success probability and thereby demonstrate the utility and scalability of our proposed gates for quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Different quantum systems possess different favorable qualities. On the one hand, ensemble-based quantum memories are suited for fast multiplexed long-range entanglement generation. On the other hand, single-atomic systems provide access to gates for processing of information. Both of those can provide advantages for high-rate entanglement generation within quantum networks. We develop a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of these properties by combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes comprised of spontaneous parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on rare-earth ion ensembles. To this end, we solve the central challenge of matching the different bandwidths of photons emitted by those systems in an initial entanglement-generation step. This enables the parallel execution of multiple probabilistic tasks in the initial stage. We show that our approach can lead to a significant speed-up for the fundamental task of creating ion-ion entanglement over hundreds of kilometers in a quantum network.</p>

            <p>We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.</p>

            <p>Commercially available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices now make small hybrid quantum-classical experiments practical, but many tools hide configuration or demand ad-hoc scripting. We introduce the Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF): A lightweight framework designed to support the systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum algorithms. Unlike many existing approaches, QEF emphasises iterative, exploratory analysis of evolving experimental strategies rather than exhaustive empirical evaluation of fixed algorithms using predefined quality metrics. The framework's design is informed by a comprehensive review of the literature, identifying principal parameters and measurement practices currently reported in the field. QEF captures all key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of variants for controlled large-scale parameter sweeps. This design enables rigorous and systematic evaluation, as well as precise reproducibility. Large sweeps are automatically partitioned into asynchronous jobs across simulators or cloud hardware, and ascertain full hyper-parameter traceability. QEF supports parameter reuse to improve overall experiment runtimes, and collects all metrics and metadata into a form that can be conveniently explored with standard statistical and visualisation software. By combining reproducibility and scalability while avoiding the complexities of full workflow engines, QEF seeks to lower the practical barriers to empirical research on quantum algorithms, whether these are designed for current NISQ devices or future error-corrected quantum systems.</p>

We present wideband homodyne detectors operating at near-infrared (NIR) and telecom wavelengths, with optimized performance at repetition rates up to 150 MHz.

            <p>We investigate into experimentally detectable effects such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching. These regimes can be characterized using the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ that enters the two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}=(1-D_S)/2$. In the case of HOM bunching (antibunching), $D_S$ is positive (negative). Though the symmetry degree can generally be expressed in terms of the difference between the contributions coming from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude (JSA), $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$, for a certain physically realizable class of the JSA, where $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ is proportional to the product of amplitudes $\varphi_1(\omega_1)\varphi_2(\omega_2)$ multiplied by a Gaussian shaped entangling factor, we find the sign of $D_S$ is primarily governed by the parity properties of the spectral function, $\varphi_{12}(\omega)=\varphi_1(\omega)\varphi_2^*(\omega)$. It is the even (odd) part of $\varphi_{12}=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}+\varphi_{12}^{(-)}$ that meets the parity condition $\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\omega-\Omega)=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\Omega-\omega)$ ($\varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\omega-\Omega)=- \varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\Omega-\omega)$) to yield the positive (negative) contribution, $D_S^{(+)}$ ($-D_S^{(-)}$), to the symmetry degree parameter: $D_S=D_S^{(+)}-D_S^{(-)}$. We have shown that switching between the bunching and antibunching regimes can be realized using the experimentally accessible family of modulated biphoton states produced using the spectral phase modulation fine-tuned via the sub-nanometer scale variation of the path length. For this class of modulated states, the Schmidt number has been computed as a function of the modulation parameter. This dependence reveals the structure of narrow resonance peaks strongly correlated with the corresponding narrow dips of the symmetry degree where the HOM antibunching occurs.</p>

A central challenge is to realize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain spatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential non-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in both qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by the AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared entanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum indistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent superpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we uncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum teleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements. Technically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical resource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they demonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and techniques in physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Search With Generalized Wildcards</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjan Cornelissen, Nikhil S. Mande, Subhasree Patro, Nithish Raja, Swagato Sanyal</p>
            <p>In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight $O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound. We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a subset $\cal{Q} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S = b$ for an arbitrary $S \in \cal{Q}$ and $b \in \{-1,1\}^S$ of its choice, at unit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\cal{Q}$ is any of the following collections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full set. All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using symmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of learning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization program, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd functions $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$ to the maximum (over $T \in \cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube whose free variables are exactly $T$.' To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal version of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program typically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds without explicitly resorting to SDP duality.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa</p>
            <p>In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Legal Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Godfrey, Ted Sichelman</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.</p>

            <h2>Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaochen Liu, Ken-Tye Yong</p>
            <p>Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4, with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K, respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K. The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and applications at ambient pressure.</p>

            <p>Quarks and gluon, as quantum particles, are subjects to various effects that go beyond the naive parton picture and are not captured by ordinary parton densities. In this work, we investigate the twist-three parton distribution functions, which encode quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states, and for the first time, determine them directly from experimental data. The analysis combines observables described by collinear and transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems within a unified global fit, incorporating a complete leading-order QCD evolution at the twist-three level. The extracted distributions reveal a clear flavor-dependent patterns and distinct from zero at a statistically significant level ($2-3\sigma$). These findings provide the first quantitative evidence for quark-gluon-quark correlations within the proton, revealing its genuinely quantum nature and opening a new direction for precision studies of partonic correlations.</p>

            <p>Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.</p>

            <p>We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental target.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as a Dynamical Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyu He, Hao Song</p>
            <p>We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$ are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular, this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior, resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a computational algebraic method using Gröbner bases over the ring of integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.</p>

In this work, we present the first machine learning algorithm with the ability to automatically locate the charge transitions of an ion-implanted donor in a silicon device, tune single-shot charge readout, and identify the gate voltage parameters where tunnelling rates in and out the donor site are the same. The entire tuning pipeline is completed on the order of minutes. Our results enable both automatic characterisation and tuning of a donor in silicon devices faster than human experts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Saharian, L. Sh. Grigoryan, V. Kh. Kotanjyan</p>
            <p>We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region. For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions $D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero. This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.</p>

            <h2>Path distributions for describing eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and other 1-dimensional problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Randall M. Feenstra</p>
            <p>The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of a harmonic oscillator, as well as other, simple 1-dimensional problems, is described. Using known, closed-form, path-based propagators for each problem, an integral expression is written that describes the wave function. This expression conventionally takes the form of an integral over initial locations of a particle, but it is re-expressed here in terms of a characteristic momentum associated with motion between the endpoints of a path. In this manner, the resulting expression can be analyzed using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, leading to distributions of paths that exactly describe each eigenstate. These distributions are valid for all travel times, but when evaluated for long times they turn out to be real, non-negative functions of the characteristic momentum. For the harmonic oscillator in particular, a somewhat broad distribution is found, peaked at value of momentum that corresponds to a classical energy which in turn equals the energy eigenvalue for the state being described.</p>

            <p>Ground state preparation is a central application for quantum computers but remains challenging in practice. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the performance and gate counts of double-bracket quantum algorithms (DBQAs) for ground state preparation. We propose a practical strategy in which DBQAs refine initial state preparation circuits, and we compile them for Heisenberg chains using controlled-Z and single-qubit gates. Warm-started DBQAs consistently improve both the energy and ground-state fidelity relative to the initial states provided by variational ansätze, indicating that DBQAs offer an effective unitary synthesis method. To demonstrate compatibility with near-term hardware, we executed a proof-of-concept example on IBM devices. With error mitigation, we observed a statistically significant improvement over the corresponding warm-start circuit. Furthermore, numerical emulations for the same system size indicate that executing DBQAs on Quantinuum's hardware could achieve similar cost-function gains without requiring error mitigation. These findings suggest that DBQAs are a promising approach for enhancing ground-state approximations on near-term quantum devices.</p>

However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states.

In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results.

            <p>Warehouses play a central role in industrial logistics, functioning as critical hubs for storing and organizing inventory to support efficient production. Optimizing item allocation within these facilities is essential for reducing operational costs and improving delivery times. In this work, we address the optimization of inventory allocation in warehouses equipped with gravity-flow racks, which are designed for First In, First Out (FIFO) logistics, a configuration that inherently requires item reinsertions during retrieval operations to maintain flow continuity. These reinsertions, however, are time-consuming and costly, so minimizing their occurrence is crucial for operational efficiency. We propose an optimization strategy that simultaneously allocates multiple items, determining their placement across available shelves in a single decision step, explicitly accounting for every item and every shelf in the warehouse. By jointly evaluating multiple items, our approach enables globally optimized placement decisions, minimizing conflicts that arise in sequential methods. The problem is formulated as a QUBO, allowing implementation on both classical metaheuristics and quantum-hybrid solvers. We assess performance by comparing three classical optimization approaches - two variants of Simulated Annealing and the commercial solver Gurobi - with D-Wave's hybrid solver, which uniquely combines quantum annealing with classical metaheuristics. Complementing these benchmarks, a factory-scale simulation based on real operational data shows that considering larger batches of items in the allocation step can significantly reduce reinsertions, highlighting the practical potential of the proposed approach for industrial logistics.</p>

            <p>We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schrödinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</p>

Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference measurements between mutually detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. At small mutual laser detunings (<=0.5GHz), the results are accurately described by the pure-state model [Nat. Commun. 16, 6453 (2025)], which treats all resonance-fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission. At larger detunings, we uncover an anomalous feature in the two-photon interference, where the normalised second-order correlation function under orthogonal polarisations yields g2_vert(0) < 0.5.</p>

Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.</p>

            <h2>All-to-all connectivity of Rydberg-atom-based quantum processors with messenger qubits</h2>

            <p>Rydberg atom arrays are a front-running platform for quantum processors. A major challenge threatening the scalability of this platform is the limited qubit connectivity due to the finite range of interatomic interactions. We explore an approach to realize dynamical all-to-all connectivity with the use of moving "messenger" atomic qubits that couple distant "computational" qubits held in a static tweezer array. We detail and compare four specific architectures based on this concept, each presenting distinct advantages and challenges tied to the efficacy of techniques used to couple, move and measure atomic qubits. We demonstrate that, though technologically demanding, the messenger-qubit paradigm opens a promising avenue to a truly scalable quantum processor based on Rydberg atoms.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous irreversibility and objective thermalization in stochastic modifications of quantum theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aritro Mukherjee</p>
            <p>The deterministic and time-reversal symmetric dynamics of isolated quantum systems is at odds with irreversible equilibration observed in generic thermodynamic systems. Standard approaches at a reconciliation employ subjective restrictions on the space of observables or states and do not explain how a single macroscopic quantum system achieves equilibrium dynamically. We instead argue that quantum theory is an effective theory and requires corrections to accurately describe systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. We construct a stochastic extension of quantum theory which is practically identical to quantum mechanics for microscopic systems, yet allows single, isolated macroscopic systems to objectively thermalize, generically. A fluctuation-dissipation relation guarantees physical consistency including norm preservation, energy conservation, no superluminal signalling and the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium. We further discuss the inclusion of objective collapse, thereby realizing a falsifiable theory of spontaneous universal irreversibility which describes the quantum-to-classical crossover dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems. The dynamics of the model describe spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum state reduction and objective quantum thermalization for individual systems while realizing an emergent hybrid statistics for ensembles which interpolates between Born's rules and microcanonical equilibrium.</p>

Suitable scaling of the Hamiltonian operator proves to be useful for the derivation of some general properties of the eigenvalues. The radial part of the Schrödinger equation is conditionally solvable and the exact polynomial solutions provide useful information. There are accidental degeneracies that take place at particular values of the box radius, some of which can be determined from the conditionally-solvable condition. Some of the roots stemming from the conditionally-solvable condition appear to converge towards the critical values of the model parameter. This analysis is facilitated by the Rayleigh-Ritz method that provides accurate eigenvalues.</p>

            <h2>Approximate Quadratization of High-Order Hamiltonians for Combinatorial Quantum Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabina Drăgoi, Alberto Baiardi, Daniel J. Egger</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems have wide-ranging applications in industry and academia. Quantum computers may help solve them by sampling from carefully prepared Ansatz quantum circuits. However, current quantum computers are limited by their qubit count, connectivity, and noise. This is particularly restrictive when considering optimization problems beyond the quadratic order. Here, we introduce Ansatze based on an approximate quadratization of high-order Hamiltonians which do not incur a qubit overhead. The price paid is a loss in the quality of the noiseless solution. Crucially, this approximation yields shallower Ansatze which are more robust to noise than the standard QAOA one. We show this through simulations of systems of 8 to 16 qubits with variable noise strengths. Furthermore, we also propose a noise-aware Ansatz design method for quadratic optimization problems. This method implements only part of the corresponding Hamiltonian by limiting the number of layers of SWAP gates in the Ansatz. We find that for both problem types, under noise, our approximate implementation of the full problem structure can significantly enhance the solution quality. Our work opens a path to enhance the solution quality that approximate quantum optimization achieves on noisy hardware.</p>

            <p>Scalable classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for advancing quantum algorithm development and validating emerging hardware. This work focuses on performance enhancements through targeted low-level and NUMA-aware tuning on a single-node system, thereby not only advancing the efficiency of classical quantum simulations but also establishing a foundation for scalable, heterogeneous implementations that bridge toward noiseless quantum computing. Although few prior studies have reported similar hardware-level optimizations, such implementations have not been released as open-source software, limiting independent validation and further development. We introduce an open-source, high-performance extension to the QuEST state vector simulator that integrates state-of-the-art low-level and NUMA-aware optimizations for modern processors. Our approach emphasizes locality-aware computation and incorporates hardware-specific techniques including NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread pinning, AVX-512 vectorization, aggressive loop unrolling, and explicit memory prefetching. Experiments demonstrate substantial speedups--5.5-6.5x for single-qubit gate operations, 4.5x for two-qubit gates, 4x for Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), and 1.8x for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Algorithmic workloads further achieve 4.3-4.6x acceleration for Grover and 2.5x for Shor-like circuits. These results show that systematic, architecture-aware tuning can significantly extend the practical simulation capacity of classical quantum simulators on current hardware.</p>

            <h2>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aabhas Gulati, Ion Nechita, Sang-Jun Park</p>
            <p>This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</p>

            <h2>Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srinivasan Arunachalam, Arkopal Dutt</p>
            <p>We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\epsilon > 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $< \epsilon$. We first show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25]. To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $S$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $S$, output $|\phi\rangle \in S$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C>1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture in the high doubling regime (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25]), we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task. As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $2$ was unknown.</p>

            <p>A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is, correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</p>

            <h2>Matrix product state approach to lossy boson sampling and noisy IQP sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sojeong Park, Changhun Oh</p>
            <p>Sampling problems have emerged as a central avenue for demonstrating quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, physical noise can fundamentally alter their computational complexity, often making them classically tractable. Motivated by the recent success of matrix product state (MPS)-based classical simulation of Gaussian boson sampling (Oh et al., 2024), we extend this framework to investigate the classical simulability of other noisy quantum sampling models. We develop MPS-based classical algorithms for lossy boson sampling and noisy instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling, both of which retain the tunable accuracy characteristic of the MPS approach through the bond dimension. Our approach constructs pure-state decompositions of noisy or lossy input states whose components remain weakly entangled after circuit evolution, thereby providing a means to systematically explore the boundary between quantum-hard and classically-simulable regimes. For boson sampling, we analyze single-photon, Fock, and cat-state inputs, showing that classical simulability emerges at transmission rates scaling as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, reaching the known boundary of quantum advantage with a tunable and scalable method. Beyond reproducing previous thresholds, our algorithm offers significantly improved control over the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. It further extends the applicability of MPS-based simulation to broader classes of noisy quantum sampling models, including IQP circuits.</p>

            <p>Electromagnetic simulations form an indispensable part of the design and optimization process for superconducting quantum devices. Although several commercial platforms exist, open-source alternatives optimized for high-performance computing remain limited. To address this gap, we introduce SQDMetal, a Python-based API that integrates Qiskit Metal (IBM), Gmsh, Palace (AWS), and Paraview (Kitware) into an open-source, highly parallel simulation workflow for superconducting quantum circuits. SQDMetal enables accurate, efficient, and scalable simulations while remaining community-driven and free from commercial constraints. In this work, we validate SQDMetal through mesh convergence studies which benchmark SQDMetal against COMSOL Multiphysics and Ansys, demonstrating excellent agreement for both eigenmode and electrostatic (capacitance) simulations. Furthermore, we simulate superconducting resonators and transmon qubits, showing reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. SQDMetal also supports advanced capabilities, including Hamiltonian extraction via the energy participation ratio (EPR) method, incorporation of kinetic inductance effects, and full 3D modelling of device geometry for improved predictive accuracy. By unifying open-source tools into a single framework, SQDMetal lowers the barriers to entry for community members seeking to access high-performance simulations to assist in the design and optimization of their devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Calixto, Octavio Castaños</p>
            <p>Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector --measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-- and from correlation functions for a $y$-space partition. The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region. For a real-space partition, the edge-state region in momentum space exhibits lower correlation modulus, but higher correlation arguments, than the bulk-state region.</p>

We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current.

            <p>In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</p>

We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</p>

            <p>In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Pipa</p>
            <p>We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interactions that give rise to gravity, which involve chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. We argue that these SDCs provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical estimate of the value of the cosmological constant, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant that weakens with time, in agreement with some of the recent evidence, and a proposal about how SDCs give rise to gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang, Cecilie Glittum</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. The two results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. We make the first step towards unifying them by studying the quasi-1D lattice of a pyrochlore stripe, where all corners are not shared between two tetrahedra, and the valence bond configurations are not fixed by the location of the vacancy. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</p>

In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</p>

In this work, we make an analysis of two types of quantum correlations, the quantum steering and discord, in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation based on the $X$-shaped spin density matrix. The behaviors of these quantum correlations differ from those in elementary particle-antiparticle systems such as the top quark and tau lepton due to the polarization effect. The hierarchy of quantum correlations is examined and partially confirmed in hyperon-antihyperon systems: $ \textrm{Bell Nonlocality} \subset \textrm{Steering} \subset \textrm{Entanglement} \subset \text{Discord}$. The loopholes and quantum decoherence effect are also discussed in our work.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear many-body systems on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting ground states of oxygen, calcium, and nickel isotopes. By combining a hard-core-boson representation of the nuclear shell model with a pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles ansatz, we achieve sub-percent relative error in the ground-state energies compared to noise-free statevector simulations. Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Spectral Edge in SYK Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ouyang, Pratik Rath</p>
            <p>Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the continuous spectrum at the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the power-law behaviour of the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</p>

            <p>We calculate bound and scattering properties of a system of two neutral atoms and an ion near an atom-ion Feshbach resonance. Our results indicate that long-range atom-ion interactions lead to significant deviations from universal behavior derived from contact or van der Waals potentials.

We further characterize the dense spectra of triatomic molecular ions with extended lifetimes. Our results provide a deeper insight on the universality and structure of three-body ionic systems and establishing them as a promising platform for exploring novel few- and many-body phenomena with long-range interactions.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p>

            <h2>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu, Po-Shen Hsin</p>
            <p>A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-König bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-König bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>Zero-Noise Extrapolation via Cyclic Permutations of Quantum Circuit Layouts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahar Sayapin, Daniil Rabinovich, Nikita Korolev, Kirill Lakhmanskiy</p>
            <p>Increasing the utility of currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices requires developing efficient methods to mitigate hardware errors, taking into account the constraints of these devices such as medium number of qubits and limited connectivity between them. In this work we propose a novel Cyclic Layout Permutations based Zero Noise Extrapolation (CLP-ZNE) protocol for such a task. The method leverages the inherent non-uniformity of gate errors in NISQ hardware and exploits symmetries of quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity to extrapolate the expectation value, averaged over cyclic circuit layout permutations, to the level of zero noise. In contrast to the previous layout permutation based approaches, for $n$ qubit circuit CLP-ZNE requires measurements of only $O(n)$ different circuit layouts to reconstruct the noiseless expected value. When benchmarked against noise channels modeling the IBM Torino quantum computer, the method reduces a typical expectation value error by an order of magnitude, depending on the protocol specifications. By employing a noise model derived from real hardware specifications, including both depolarizing and $T_1/T_2$ relaxation processes, these results give evidence for the applicability of CLP-ZNE to present-day NISQ processors.</p>

            <h2>Classical shadows for sample-efficient measurements of gauge-invariant observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Bringewatt, Henry Froland, Andreas Elben, Niklas Mueller</p>
            <p>Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.</p>

            <h2>Correlation Self-Testing of Quantum Theory against Generalised Probabilistic Theories with Restricted Relabelling Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuntal Sengupta, Mirjam Weilenmann, Roger Colbeck</p>
            <p>Correlation self-testing of quantum theory involves identifying a task or set of tasks whose optimal performance can be achieved only by theories that can realise the same set of correlations as quantum theory in every causal structure. Following this approach, previous work has ruled out various classes of generalised probabilistic theories whose joint state spaces have a certain regularity in the sense of a (discrete) rotation symmetry of the bipartite state spaces. Here we consider theories whose bipartite state spaces lack this regularity. We form them by taking the convex hull of all the local states and a finite number of non-local states. We show that a criterion of compositional consistency is needed in such theories: for a measurement effect to be valid, there must exist at least one measurement that it is part of. This goes beyond previous consistency criteria and corresponds to a strengthening of the no-restriction hypothesis. We show that quantum theory outperforms these theories in a task called the adaptive CHSH game, which shows that they can be ruled out experimentally. We further show a connection between compositional consistency and Tsirelson's bound.</p>

            <h2>Motional entanglement in low-energy collisions near shape resonances</h2>

            <p>Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen discussed their paradox in terms of measuring the positions or momenta of two particles. These can become entangled upon scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we address this question with fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic description of a scattering setup and narrow initial momentum dispersion, we find the entanglement to scale linearly with the scattering cross section, including strong enhancement close to shape resonances. We discuss how the generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results open the way to probing and eventually using entanglement in quantum collisions.</p>

            <p>Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits, converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.</p>

            <p>Induced-coherence interferometry, first introduced in the Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) setup, enables retrieval of object information from the interference pattern of light that never interacted with the object. This scheme relies on two identically correlated photon pairs and the absence of "which-way" information about the photons illuminating the object to induce coherence in their companions. In previous studies, the effect of thermal background on the ZWM interferometer was considered; here we explicitly include background noise and analyze the interference visibility in both low- and high-gain regimes, revealing how thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that lowers the observed interference contrast. We show that the visibility can be restored either by optimal attenuation or by extending the geometry to a three-SPDC configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing heralded detection removes the detrimental effect of thermal background noise, restoring high-contrast interference fringes.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments. The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\sim1$~nm precision. Our results establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum properties of superpositions of oppositely squeezed states, which can be regarded as Schrodinger cat states. Compared with conventional coherent-state cat states, these states exhibit distinct photon-number structures and enhanced nonclassical features. We analyze their Wigner function and quantify the entanglement generated when they are injected into a 50:50 beam splitter. For small squeezing parameters, the resulting two-mode states possess higher entanglement than pure two-mode squeezed vacuum states. We also propose a linear-optical heralding scheme that approximates this superposition of oppositely squeezed states without requiring strong Kerr nonlinearities. Our results indicate that such states are promising resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing, particularly in regimes where high non-Gaussianity and strong entanglement are desirable.</p>

            <p>In this manuscript, we analyze the mechanism of the superradiant phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model under the classical oscillator limit using the pattern picture. By expanding the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian in operator space, we obtained three patterns, and we find that the phase transition arises from the competition between patterns. The difficulty in achieving the classical oscillator limit motivates our investigation into the quantum phase transition within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model. This parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model can reproduce the dynamics of a ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model in a squeezed-light frame. According to the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the normal and superradiant phases of this equivalent anisotropic Rabi model, we find that the excitation energy of the normal phase and the superradiant phase vanishes at the critical point. The photon number becomes infinite beyond the critical point. These results indicate that the system undergoes a superradiant phase transition at the critical point.</p>

            <p>Quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum many-body systems and hybrid quantum computing architectures is a fundamental yet challenging task. In recent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work from an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures that are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be restrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong collective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum simulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by evaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of interactions or by measuring suitable local observables only. We show that this formalism allows us to correctly estimate genuine multipartite entanglement in both stationary and time-evolved states of systems with strong interactions, including parametrized quantum states simulated on a quantum circuit with varying circuit depth and noise. We demonstrate its applicability to realistic physical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model, and the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Achieving strong coupling between excitons of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPs) is critical for advanced room-temperature quantum emitter and sensing applications. A key challenge is to have precise control of the emitters position with respect to an individual plasmonic nanostructure. Here, we present room temperature strong coupling between QDs and a single gold nano-bipyramid (BPs). The selection of the bipyramid plasmonic nanocavity offers access to a single hotspot with a very small mode volume. The localization of QDs at a single hotspot is achieved via plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization. This technique exploits the enhanced electric field at the BP tip to selectively polymerize a photosensitive QD-containing formulation. Room-temperature scattering spectra of a 3-QD-BP system reveal Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength of 175.68 meV. The with distinct anti-crossing behavior is confirmed by simulations. This approach simplifies QD integration for strong coupling systems compared to previous methods. These results indicate a scalable platform for solid-state quantum technologies with colloidal QDs, enabling explora-tion of exciton-plasmon interactions and further advance-ment of applications in quantum optics and quantum sensing under ambient conditions.</p>

            <p>Chiral discrimination of enantiomeric biomolecules is vital in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical chiral probes remain fundamentally bounded by the shot-noise limit due to quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate-photon-flux, high-sensitivity, quantum-noise-squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5 dB improvement beyond the SNL in distinguishing L- and D-amino acids in liquid phase. This non-destructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research, environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis.</p>

Such continuous monitoring may trap the measured quantum system in a decoherence-free subspace, a fraction of the available state space that is isolated from the surroundings, and thus plays an important role in quantum information science. We analytically determine the first-passage time distribution, whose form neither depends on the system Hamiltonian nor on the measurement operator, and is therefore universal. These results provide a general framework to investigate the first-passage statistics of diffusive quantum trajectories.</p>

            <p>Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunwoo Choi, Jisang Seo, Weng C. Chew, Dong-Yeop Na</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics, thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.</p>

Similarly to him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In contrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to suppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian, non-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of light form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition.</p>

            <h2>Annual-modulation fingerprint of the axion wind induced sideband triplet in quantum dot spin qubit sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Tan, Zhanning Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Correlation-Powered Work: Equivalence in Peak Yield, Differences in Robustness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Svozil</p>
            <p>Initial system-environment correlations are a thermodynamic resource, enabling work extraction via their erasure. We compare the work potential of classical, quantum, and hypothetical stronger-than-quantum correlations as a function of measurement misalignment. While all models can yield a peak extractable work of k_B T ln 2, corresponding to a mutual information of ln 2, their value as a resource differs critically in its robustness. The classical resource is fragile, decaying linearly with misalignment, whereas the quantum resource is robust, decaying only quadratically. Thus, the degree of nonlocality maps not to the maximum energetic value of a correlation, but to its operational robustness as a thermodynamic fuel.</p>

            <p>Cryptography depends on truly unpredictable numbers, but physical sources emit biased or correlated bits. Quantum mechanics enables the amplification of imperfect randomness into nearly perfect randomness, but prior demonstrations have required physically co-located, loophole-free Bell tests, constraining the feasibility of remote operation. Here we realize certified randomness amplification across a network by dynamically probing large, entangled quantum states on Quantinuum's 98-qubit Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Our protocol is secure even if the remote device acts maliciously or is compromised by an intercepting adversary, provided the samples are generated quickly enough to preclude classical simulation of the quantum circuits. We stream quantum gates in real time to the quantum processor, maintain quantum state coherence for $\approx 0.9$ seconds, and then reveal the measurement bases to the quantum processor only milliseconds before measurement. This limits the time for classical spoofing to 30 ms and constrains the location of hypothetical adversaries to a $4{,}500$ km radius. We achieve a fidelity of 0.586 on random circuits with 64 qubits and 276 two-qubit gates, enabling the amplification of realistic imperfect randomness with a low entropy rate into nearly perfect randomness.</p>

            <h2>Frequency shifts as a reflection of ground state squeezing and entanglement in two coupled harmonic oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Safoura Mirkhalaf, Helmut Ritsch, Karol Gietka</p>
            <p>It is often argued that two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems act as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement at zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts and squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one description manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can serve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency measurements. Furthermore, we show that this underlying squeezing, although not directly measurable, can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring squeezed quantum noise. Our results uncover a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh insight into how signatures of quantumness persist across the quantum-to-classical boundary.</p>

In this model, quantum algorithms have been shown to offer an unconditional exponential advantage in space. However, experimentally implementing such streaming algorithms requires qubits that remain coherent while interacting with an external data stream. In this work, we realize such a data-streaming model using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum computer with long-lived qubits that communicate with an external server. We implement a quantum pair sketch, which is the primitive underlying many quantum streaming algorithms, and use it to solve Hidden Matching, a problem known to exhibit a theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space. Furthermore, we compile the quantum streaming algorithm to fault-tolerant quantum architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes and show that the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of fault-tolerance.</p>

            <p>The individual optimization of quantum circuit parameters is currently one of the main practical bottlenecks in variational quantum eigensolvers for electronic systems. To this end, several machine learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the problem.

This work explores machine learning based modeling strategies to include transferability between different molecules. We use a well investigated quantum circuit design and apply it to model properties of hydrogenic systems where we show parameter prediction that is systematically transferable to instances significantly larger than the training instances.</p>

Within a fixed hyperangular channel $s>0$, contact-weighted products of associated Laguerre polynomials reduce to an elementary gamma ratio, yielding: (i) a level resolved fractional breathing mode shift with scaling $\delta\omega/(2\omega)\propto Q^{-1}$, where $Q\equiv 2q+s+1$, with $q$ the radial quantum number; (ii) a first order quantum anomaly correction involving exactly two intermediate states, producing a $Q^{-2}$ falloff of the leaked monopole strength with an explicit prefactor; and (iii) a closed form finite temperature average exhibiting a low-$T$ plateau and a $1/T$ high-$T$ tail. We also obtain a mixed anomaly\nobreakdash-quartic correction for weak anharmonicity.

            <h2>Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Ferenczi, Sutapa Samanta, Dagen Wang, Todd Hodges</p>
            <p>Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning (ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs), thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii) adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10 dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.</p>

            <p>The quantum error correction threshold is closely related to the Nishimori physics of random statistical models. We extend quantum information measures such as coherent information beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as sharp indicators of phase transitions. We derive exact inequalities for several generalized measures, demonstrating that each attains its extremum along the Nishimori line. Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these quantities in the 2d $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects. We further analyze the domain-wall free energy distribution and confirm its scale invariance at the multicritical point.</p>

We show, in analogy to global existence results for first order ODEs, that global existence and uniqueness still hold true if the local terms grow at most linearly in space. Moreover, we obtain Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential light cones for the generated dynamics. For the proof, we mainly assume Lieb-Robinson bounds with linear light cones for dynamics generated by uniformly bounded local terms. These are known to hold for example if the local terms are exponentially localized.</p>

            <p>We introduce a focal-plane detector for advancing the energy and angular resolutions of current X-ray telescopes. The architecture integrates a metallic magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\mu$m absorber length used with a 12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of ~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.</p>

            <p>Molecular spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum technologies, but their performance is limited by decoherence arising from diverse mechanisms. The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to $T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times. These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits for scalable quantum devices.</p>

For specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact, degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect transmission.

Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.</p>

Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.</p>

            <p>Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <p>We derive a repulsive, charge-dipole-like interaction for a Dirac particle in a rotating frame, arising from a geometric $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated with the Berry phase. The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\vert r\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction.</p>

In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of the magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out divergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of generators, which signal either the breakdown of the Néel-ordered phase or the presence of significant magnon decay.</p>

Second, we propose a symmetry-adapted, even-tempered formalism specifically designed for molecular systems. It requires only primitive S-subshell Gaussian-type orbitals and uses two parameters to characterize all exponent coefficients. In the case of the diatomic hydrogen molecule, the basis set generated by this formalism produces a dissociation curve more consistent with cc-pV5Z than cc-pVTZ at the size of aug-cc-pVDZ. Finally, we test our even-tempered formalism against several types of tetra-atomic hydrogen molecules for ground-state computation and point out its current limitations and potential improvements.</p>

            <p>The use of macroscopic coherent quantum states at room temperature is crucial in modern quantum technologies. In light of recent experiments demonstrating high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this work we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning exciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton interacting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well as with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear equations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's coefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which translates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the form of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear stability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question, which allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly important for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the considered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific case of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton interacts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable, provided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity value defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore, interactions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of modulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations. We also numerically solve the 2D nonlocal NLS equation in the polar coordinates and obtain its fundamental soliton solution, which is stable.</p>

            <h2>Superresolving collective quantum measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. O. de Almeida, M. Lewenstein, M. Skotiniotis</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a method for super-resolving signals encoded as finite mixtures of bosonic modes using collective measurements that exploit permutation symmetry. Specifically, we use multiple copies of the state $\rho$ of the finite mixture to extract an estimate for the purity of $\rho$ via a spectrum measurement, the weak Schur-sampling measurement. Depending on the outcome we then further fine-grain the measurement to optimally extract an estimate of the relative intensity between the two incoherent mixtures. Our protocol furnishes simultaneous estimates for both the relative intensity and the separation of incoherent signals saturating the multi-parameter Cramér-Rao bound, and is robust against misalignment errors. We also provide viable experimental avenues for implementing such collective measurements in different set-ups.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional entanglement provides unique ways of transcending the limitations of current approaches in quantum information processing, quantum communications based on qubits. The generation of time-frequency qudit states offer significantly increased quantum capacities while keeping the number of photons constant, but pose significant challenges regarding the possible measurements for certification of entanglement. Here, we develop a new scheme and experimentally demonstrate the certification of 24-dimensional entanglement and a 9-dimensional quantum steering. We then subject our photon-pairs to dispersion conditions equivalent to the transmission through 600-km of fiber and still certify 21-dimensional entanglement. Furthermore, we use a steering inequality to prove 7-dimensional entanglement in a semi-device independent manner, proving that large chromatic dispersion is not an obstacle in distributing and certifying high-dimensional entanglement and quantum steering. Our approach, leveraging intrinsic large-alphabet nature of telecom-band photons, enables scalable, commercially viable, and field-deployable entangled and steerable quantum sources, providing a pathway towards fully scalable quantum information processer and high-dimensional quantum communication networks.</p>

            <h2>Optimal finite-dimensional probe states for quantum phase estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Feng Qin, Yuqian Xu, Jing Liu</p>
            <p>Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology, especially in quantum interferometry. A full phase estimation scheme usually includes the optimal probe state and measurement. For the finite-dimensional states in Fock basis, the N00N state ceases to be optimal when the average particle number is fixed yet not equal to the Fock dimension (Fock number of the highest occupied Fock state of one mode), and what is the true optimal finite-dimensional probe state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal finite-dimensional probe states reveal an important fact that the Fock dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</p>

            <h2>Multi-qubit DC gates over an inhomogeneous array of quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaan Qi, Zhi-Hai Liu, Hongqi Xu</p>
            <p>The prospect of large-scale quantum computation with an integrated chip of spin qubits is imminent as technology improves. This invites us to think beyond the traditional 2-qubit-gate framework and consider a naturally supported ``instruction set'' of multi-qubit gates. In this work, we systematically study such a family of multi-qubit gates implementable over an array of quantum dots by DC evolution. A useful representation of the computational Hamiltonian is proposed for a dot-array with strong spin-orbit coupling effects, distinctive $g$-factor tensors and varying interdot couplings. Adopting a perturbative treatment, we model a multi-qubit DC gate by the first-order dynamics in the qubit frame and develop a detailed formalism for decomposing the resulting gate, estimating and optimizing the coherent gate errors with appropriate local phase shifts for arbitrary array connectivity. Examples of such multi-qubit gates and their applications in quantum error correction and quantum algorithms are also explored, demonstrating their potential advantage in accelerating complex tasks and reducing overall errors.</p>

QIR-EE uses LLVM to execute hybrid instructions specifying quantum programs and, by design, presents extension points that support customized runtime and hardware environments. We demonstrate an implementation that uses the XACC quantum hardware-accelerator library to dispatch prototypical quantum programs on different commercial quantum platforms and numerical simulators, and we validate execution of QIR-EE on IonQ, Quantinuum, and IBM hardware. Our results highlight the efficiency of hybrid executable architectures for handling mixed instructions, managing mixed data, and integrating with quantum computing frameworks to realize cross-platform execution.</p>

            <h2>Contraction of Private Quantum Channels and Private Quantum Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theshani Nuradha, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. With the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight, while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.</p>

            <p>Finding molecular ground states and energies with variational quantum eigensolvers is central to chemistry applications on quantum computers. Physically motivated ansätze based on excitation operators respect physical symmetries, but existing quantum-aware optimizers, such as Rotosolve, have been limited to simpler operator types. To fill this gap, we introduce ExcitationSolve, a fast quantum-aware optimizer that is globally-informed, gradient-free, and hyperparameter-free. ExcitationSolve extends these optimizers to parameterized unitaries with generators $G$ of the form $G^3=G$ exhibited by excitation operators in approaches such as unitary coupled cluster. ExcitationSolve determines the global optimum along each variational parameter using the same quantum resources that gradient-based optimizers require for one update step. We provide optimization strategies for both fixed and adaptive variational ansätze, along with generalizations for simultaneously selecting and optimizing multiple excitations. On molecular ground state energy benchmarks, ExcitationSolve outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by converging faster, achieving chemical accuracy for equilibrium geometries in a single parameter sweep, yielding shallower adaptive ansätze and remaining robust to real hardware noise. By uniting physical insight with efficient optimization, ExcitationSolve paves the way for scalable quantum chemistry calculations.</p>

            <p>Whilst the complexity of acquiring knowledge of a quantum state has been extensively studied in the fields of quantum tomography and quantum learning, a physical understanding of its operational role and cost in quantum thermodynamics is lacking. Knowledge is central to thermodynamics, as exemplified by Maxwell's demon thought experiment, where a demonic agent is able to extract paradoxical amounts of work -- reconciled by the thermodynamic costs of acquiring this knowledge. In this work, we address this gap by extending unitary models of measurement to incorporate the resources available to an agent. We view an agent's knowledge of a quantum state as their ability to reconstruct it unitarily given access to states with partial knowledge of the true state. In our model, an agent correlates an unknown $d$-dimensional system, with copies of a $k$-dimensional probe ($k\leq d$), which are then used to unitarily reconstruct an estimate state in $d$-dimensional memories. We find that this framework is a unitary representation of coarse-grained POVMs. As an application, we investigate the role of knowledge in an extended Szilard Engine scenario.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Sedlák, Robert Stárek, Nikola Horová, Michal Mičuda, Jaromir Fiurášek, Alessandro Bisio</p>
            <p>We address the fundamental task of converting $n$ uses of an unknown unitary transformation into a quantum state (i.e., storage) and later retrieval of the transformation. Specifically, we consider the case where the unknown unitary is selected with equal prior probability from two options. First, we prove that the optimal storage strategy involves the sequential application of the $n$ uses of the unknown unitary, and it produces the optimal state for discrimination between the two possible unitaries. Next, we show that incoherent "measure-and-prepare" retrieval achieves the maximum fidelity between the retrieved operation and the original (qubit) unitary. We then identify the retrieval strategy that maximizes the probability of successfully and perfectly retrieving the unknown transformation. In the regime in which the fidelity between the two possible unitaries is large the probability of success scales as $ P_{succ} = 1 - \mathcal{O}(n^{-2} ) $, which is a quadratic improvement with respect to the case in which the unitaries are drawn from the entire unitary group $U(d)$ with uniform prior probability. Finally, we present an optical experiment for this approach and assess the storage and retrieval quality using quantum tomography of states and processes. The results are discussed in relation to non-optimal measure-and-prepare strategy, highlighting the advantages of our protocol.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungeng Zhou, Jiahao Huang, Jinye Wei, Chengyin Han, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>Entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors encounter a fundamental trade-off: while entanglement improves precision to the Heisenberg limit, it restricts dynamic range. To address this trade-off, we present a credible-interval-based adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state-based atomic clocks. Our method optimally integrates prior knowledge with new measurements and determines the interrogation time by correlating it with the period of the likelihood function, based on Bayesian credible intervals. Our protocol can be implemented using either individual or cascaded GHZ states, thereby extending the dynamic range without compromising Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. In parallel with the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol using fixed interrogation times, the dynamic range can be extended through an interferometry sequence that employs individual GHZ states with variable interrogation times. Furthermore, by varying the interrogation times, the dynamic range of the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol can be further extended. Crucially, our protocol enables dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling $\propto 1/(Nt)$ in both particle number $N$ and total interrogation time $t$, surpassing the hybrid scaling $\propto 1/{(N\sqrt {t}})$ of the conventional cascaded-GHZ-state protocol. While offering a wider dynamic range, the protocol is more stable against noise and more robust to dephasing than existing adaptive schemes. Beyond atomic clocks, our approach establishes a general framework for developing entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors that simultaneously achieve both high precision and broad dynamic range.</p>

            <p>The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behavior of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce color-neutrality constraints. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum state tomography, the task of learning an unknown quantum state, is a fundamental problem in quantum information. In standard settings, the complexity of this problem depends significantly on the type of quantum state that one is trying to learn, with pure states being substantially easier to learn than general mixed states. A natural question is whether this separation holds for any quantum state learning setting. In this work, we consider the online learning framework and prove the surprising result that learning pure states in this setting is as hard as learning mixed states. More specifically, we show that both classes share almost the same sequential fat-shattering dimension, leading to identical regret scaling. We also generalize previous results on full quantum state tomography in the online setting to (i) the $\epsilon$-realizable setting and (ii) learning the density matrix only partially, using smoothed analysis.</p>

            <p>In 2024, Kliuchnikov and Schönnenbeck showed a connection between the Barnes Wall lattices, stabilizer states and Clifford operations. In this work, we study their results and relate them to the problem of lower bounding stabilizer ranks. We show the first quantitative lower bound on stabilizer fidelity as a function of stabilizer ranks, which reproduces the linear-by-log lower bound for $\chi_{\delta}({|{H}\rangle^{ \otimes n}})$, i.e, on the approximate stabilizer rank of $|H\rangle^{\otimes n}$. In fact, we show that the lower bound holds even when the fidelity between the approximation and ${|H\rangle}^{\otimes n}$ is exponentially small, which is currently the best lower bound in this regime. Next, we define a new magic monotone for pure states, the Barnes Wall norm, and its corresponding approximate variant. We upper bound these monotones by the $CS$-count of state preparation, and also by the stabilizer ranks. In particular, the upper bound given by the $CS$-count is tight, in the sense that we exhibit states that achieve the bound. Apart from these results, we give a Fidelity Amplification algorithm, which provides a trade-off between approximation error and the stabilizer rank. As a corollary, it gives us a way to compose approximate stabilizer decompositions into approximate decompositions of their tensor products. Finally, we provide an alternate, elementary proof of the existence and density of product states with maximal stabilizer ranks, which was first proven by Lovitz and Steffan (2022), where they used results from algebraic geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andy Chia, Wai-Keong Mok, Leong-Chuan Kwek, Changsuk Noh</p>
            <p>Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schrödinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Liénard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</p>

Here we present and experimentally demonstrate an efficient encoding scheme based on chains of Rydberg-blockaded atoms, which we call quantum wires, to natively embed maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems on a neutral atom architecture. For graphs with quasi-unit-disk connectivity, in which only a few long-range edges are required, our approach requires a significantly lower overhead in the number of ancilla qubits than previous proposals, facilitating the implementation on currently available hardware. To demonstrate the approach, we perform weighted-graph annealing on a programmable atom array using local light shifts to encode problem-specific weights across graphs of varying sizes. This approach successfully identifies the solutions to the original MWIS and QUBO graph instances.

            <p>We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.</p>

            <p>Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distributions. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature fails to accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically more accurate at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</p>

            <p>Collision models (CMs) describe an open system interacting in sequence with elements of an environment, termed ancillas. They have been established as a useful tool for analyzing non-Markovian open quantum dynamics based on the ability to control the environmental memory through simple feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how ancilla-ancilla entanglement can serve as a mechanism for controlling the non-Markovianity of an open system, focusing on an operational approach to generating correlations within the environment. To this end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially generated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a composite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an enlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and show that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of ancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand, when system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find the open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain qualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the onset of system non-Markovianity.</p>

Our approach efficiently constructs block-encodings of (persistent) Laplacians, enabling estimation via stochastic rank methods with complexity polylogarithmic in the number of simplices across both sparse and dense regimes. Unlike prior spectral algorithms that suffer when Betti numbers are small, we introduce homology tracking and property testing techniques achieving exponential speedups under natural sparsity and structure assumptions. We also formulate homology triviality and equivalence testing as property testing problems, giving nearly linear-time quantum algorithms when the boundary rank is large. A cohomological formulation further yields rank-independent testing and polylog-time manipulation of $r$-cocycles via block-encoded projections. These results open a new direction in quantum topological data analysis and demonstrate provable quantum advantages in computing topological invariants.</p>

Data is encoded via programmable phase shaping of the pump in an optical parametric process and retrieved through mode-selective homodyne detection. Real-time memory is achieved through feedback using electro-optic phase modulation, while long-term dependencies are achieved via spatial multiplexing. This architecture with minimal post-processing performs nonlinear temporal tasks, including parity checking and chaotic signal forecasting, with results corroborated by a high-fidelity Digital Twin. We show that leveraging the entangled multimode structure significantly enhances the expressivity and memory capacity of the quantum reservoir.

            <h2>Learning-Optimized Qubit Mapping and Reuse to Minimize Inter-Core Communication in Modular Quantum Architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sokea Sang, Leanghok Hour, Youngsun Han</p>
            <p>Modular quantum architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling quantum computing systems by connecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). However, this approach introduces significant challenges due to costly inter-core operations between chips and quantum state transfers, which contribute to noise and quantum decoherence. This paper presents QARMA, a novel Qubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for Modular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that incorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an attention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal qubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core communications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based encoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit interactions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages mid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and qubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular architecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to 100% (on average 86%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger circuits without reuse. Against traditional modular qubit mapping, our approach achieves 97-100% reduction in inter-core operation. The proposed methods advance quantum circuit compilation techniques and enable the execution of more extensive quantum algorithms on resource-constrained modular quantum systems, contributing to the growing body of research on scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Qi, Chao-Han Yang, Pin-Yu Chen, Min-Hsiu Hsieh</p>
            <p>Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) hold promise for quantum machine learning but face challenges in expressivity, trainability, and noise resilience. We propose VQC-MLPNet, a hybrid architecture where a VQC generates the first-layer weights of a classical multilayer perceptron during training, while inference is performed entirely classically. This design preserves scalability, reduces quantum resource demands, and enables practical deployment. We provide a theoretical analysis based on statistical learning and neural tangent kernel theory, establishing explicit risk bounds and demonstrating improved expressivity and trainability compared to purely quantum or existing hybrid approaches. These theoretical insights demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum architectures. Empirical results on diverse datasets, including quantum-dot classification and genomic sequence analysis, show that VQC-MLPNet achieves high accuracy and robustness under realistic noise models, outperforming classical and quantum baselines while using significantly fewer trainable parameters.</p>

            <h2>Constant-Factor Improvements in Quantum Algorithms for Linear Differential Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Pocrnic, Peter D. Johnson, Amara Katabarwa, Nathan Wiebe</p>
            <p>Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form $\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for \textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known about \textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if state preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous resource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the most general case whereby the dynamics are not \textit{fast-forwardable}, these findings provide a 100-200x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis contributes towards establishing more promising applications for quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane Dooley, Luke Johnston, Patrick Gormley, Beth Campbell</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eimantas Ledinauskas, Egidijus Anisimovas</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising and $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg models show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with state of the art methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.</p>

            <p>Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to the presence of barren plateaus and its sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</p>

            <p>Topological data analysis (TDA) has become an attractive area for the application of quantum computing. Recent advances have uncovered many interesting connections between the two fields. On one hand, complexity theoretic results show that estimating Betti numbers, a central task in TDA, is NP hard, indicating that a generic quantum speedup is unlikely. On the other hand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings and demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups under certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti numbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity and holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of topological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of homology that can reveal richer structural information. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for torsion detection, that is, determining whether a given simplicial complex contains torsion. Our algorithm, assisted by a low complexity classical procedure, can succeed with high probability and potentially offer exponential speedup over the classical counterpart.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing has made remarkable strides in recent years, as demonstrated by quantum supremacy experiments and the realization of high-fidelity, fault-tolerant gates. However, a major obstacle persists: practical real-world applications remain scarce, largely due to the inefficiency of loading classical data into quantum processors. Here, we propose an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from classical data encoding to directly processing quantum data. We target quantum metrology, a practical quantum technology whose precision is often constrained by realistic noise. We develop an experimentally feasible scheme in which a quantum computer optimizes information acquired from quantum metrology, thereby enhancing performance in noisy quantum metrology tasks and overcoming the classical-data-loading bottleneck. We demonstrate this approach through experimental implementation with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and numerical simulations using models of distributed superconducting quantum processors. Our results show that this method improves the accuracy of sensing estimates and significantly boosts sensitivity, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, thus offering a new pathway to harness near-term quantum computers for realistic quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>A Deficiency-Based Framework for the Operational Interpretation of Quantum Resources with Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunho Kim, Chunhe Xiong, Junde Wu</p>
            <p>A fundamental challenge in quantum resource theory lies in establishing operational interpretations by quantifying the distinct advantages that quantum resources provide over classical resources in specific physical tasks. However, conventional quantum resource theories have inherent limitations in characterizing operational advantages for certain quantum tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that defines the resource deficiency of a given state relative to the set of maximal resource states in physical tasks. This extension not only broadens the scope of quantum resource theories and provides more comprehensive operational interpretations, but also delivers crucial insights for classifying and interpreting mixed resource states -- specifically those with inactive resource properties in certain tasks -- that have remained uncharacterized in conventional quantum resource theories. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the proposed geometric measure satisfies the framework's requirements for both quantum coherence and entanglement, while also demonstrating its ability to characterize the operational disadvantage of arbitrary states compared to maximal resource states in subchannel discrimination tasks under specific conditions.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study a hybrid quantum system composed of a quantum battery and a coherence-driven charger interacting with a Quantum Autonomous Thermal Machine (QATM). The QATM, made of two qubits, each coupled to Markovian bosonic thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, acts as a structured environment that mediates energy and coherence transfer between the charger and the battery. By applying a coherent driving field on the charger, we investigate the coherence injection effect on the dynamics, including non-Markovianity, power of charging, coherence storage, and ergotropy. We show that the QATM effectively filters the decoherence induced by the thermal baths and induces non-Markovian memory effects due to correlation backflow. Our results demonstrate that coherence driving enhances the battery's ergotropy; coherence driving raises the maximum ergotropy by approximately 40% compared to the case without coherence driving, and the power of charging by preserving the internal energy of the charger and facilitating coherent energy transfer.</p>

In the present work, we provide a more detailed account of this issue. In particular, we argue that agreement or disagreement between standard quantum mechanics and Bohmian mechanics on quantities such as particle velocity, speed, tunnelling, and dwell times depends solely on the choice of guiding equation. If this choice is made based on observable spatio-temporal transformation behaviour of the particle density, the two theories agree on these phenomena.</p>

We introduce two methods to improve GQE.

Second, as a method to improve the online learning during the training phase of GQE, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines online and offline learning. Using a transformer decoder implementation of GQE, we evaluate our methods through ground state search experiments on the $\mathrm{BeH_2^{}}$ molecule and observe that P-DPO achieves lower energies than DPO. The hybrid approach further improves convergence and final energy values, particularly with P-DPO. A method for imposing upper constraints on the occurrences of specific gates is also presented, which serves to enhance the applicability of GQE.</p>

            <p>We study multiparty entanglement near measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), which arise in ensembles of local quantum circuits built with unitaries and measurements. In contrast to equilibrium quantum critical transitions, where entanglement is short-ranged, MIPTs possess long-range k-party genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) characterized by an infinite hierarchy of entanglement exponents for k>=2. First, we represent the average spread of entanglement with "entanglement clusters," and use them to conjecture general exponent relations: 1) classical dominance, 2) monotonicity, 3) subadditivity. We then introduce measure-weighted graphs to construct such clusters in general circuits. Second, we obtain the exact entanglement exponents for a 1d MIPT in a measurement-only circuit that maps to percolation by exploiting non-unitary conformal field theory. The exponents, which we numerically verify, obey the inequalities. We also extend the construction to a 2d MIPT that maps to classical 3d percolation, and numerically find the first entanglement exponents. Our results provide a firm ground to understand the multiparty entanglement of MIPTs, and more general ensembles of quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>We study the use of triorthogonal codes for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and propose two methods to circumvent the Eastin-Knill theorem, which prohibits any single quantum error-correcting code from supporting both universality and a transversal gate set. We show that our methods reduce the resource overhead compared with existing fault-tolerant protocols. We develop a simple fault-tolerant implementation of the logical Hadamard gate for triorthogonal codes by exploiting the fact that they have transversal controlled-Z (CZ) gates, resulting in a circuit with reduced overhead. We also introduce a procedure for generating a symmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane code paired with a triorthogonal code, which allows CNOT and CZ gate transversality across the pair of codes. In addition, we present logical state teleportation circuits that transfer encoded states between the two codes, allowing all logical operations to be performed transversally. Our methods can be integrated into the Steane error correction framework without incurring additional resource cost. Finally, using the 15-qubit code as an example, we demonstrate that our protocols significantly reduce the gate overhead compared with other existing methods. These results highlight the potential of combining distinct code structures to achieve low-overhead, universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

Verification and evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error. It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution, supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources.

            <p>Autonomous quantum machines (AQMs) execute tasks without requiring time-dependent external control. Motivations for AQMs include the restrictions imposed by classical control on quantum machines' coherence times and geometries. Most AQM work is theoretical and abstract; yet an experiment recently demonstrated AQMs' usefulness in qubit reset, crucial to quantum computing. To further reduce quantum computing's classical control, we propose realizations of (fully and partially) quantum-autonomous gates on three platforms: Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. First, we show that a Rydberg-blockade interaction or an ultrafast transition can quantum-autonomously effect entangling gates on Rydberg atoms. One can perform $Z$ or entangling gates on trapped ions mostly quantum-autonomously, by sculpting a linear Paul trap or leveraging a ring trap. Passive lasers control these gates, as well as the Rydberg-atom gates, quantum-autonomously. Finally, circuit quantum electrodynamics can enable quantum-autonomous $Z$ and $XY$ gates on superconducting qubits. The gates can serve as building blocks for (fully or partially) quantum-autonomous circuits, which may reduce classical-control burdens.</p>

Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually.

We evaluate the framework on a 50-asset portfolio optimization problem using historical S&P 500 data, benchmarking against classical simulated annealing. Results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the scalability and practical potential of our method in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

            <p>Quantum computation with $d$-level quantum systems, also known as qudits, benefits from the possibility to use a richer computational space compared to qubits. However, for arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform the issue is that a generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native operations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels in a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each other due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a significant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may introduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to decompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses is at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific operations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses. We provide a comparison of qudit decompositions for several types of trapped ions, specifically $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$, $^{137}\text{Ba}^+$ and $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ with different selection rules, and also decomposition for superconducting qudits.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a promising route toward scalable quantum computation, where entanglement-assisted LOCC and circuit knitting represent two complementary approaches. The former deterministically realizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources, whereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential sampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these two paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of entanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical communication. Furthermore, we extend the entanglement-assisted circuit knitting framework to the black-box setting, which can be applicable to the circuit knitting of quantum combs.

            <p>In their recent work [Nature,646,813(2025)], Aziz and Howl claim that classical (unquantized) gravity produces entanglement of quantized matter if matter is treated within quantum field theory which is, no doubt, our ultimate theory to use.

            <h2>EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikołaj Sienicki, Krzysztof Sienicki</p>
            <p>We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</p>

            <p>When two particles collide in an asymptotically AdS spacetime with high enough energy and small enough impact parameter, they can form a black hole.

            <h2>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matjaž Kebrič, Ulrich Schollwöck, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neel Mackinnon, Jörg B. Götte, Stephen M. Barnett, Niclas Westerberg</p>
            <p>We present a new approach to the definition of optical helicity in a medium. Our approach resolves the problem that duality transformations which simultaneously combine $\mathbf{E}$ with $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ with $\mathbf{B}$ are incompatible with linear constitutive relations. We find that the helicity density in a medium, as the conserved quantity associated with duality transforms, must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and that it can be expressed naturally in terms of the elementary polarised excitations of the system. In media for which the helicity is conserved, each circular excitation carries a well-defined helicity. However, in a medium for which the helicity is not conserved, we find that the time-varying helicity can be viewed in terms of oscillations between different helicity eigenstates, analogous to neutrino oscillations. Here we explicitly study the helicity in homogeneous and lossless media but we believe that, differently to other choices, this helicity is readily generalisable to media that may be inhomogeneous, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mian Wu, Nan Li, Han Cai, Cheng Liu, Huizhu Hu</p>
            <p>Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum experience both electrostatic and light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, offering a versatile platform to explore mesoscopic entanglement and many-body dynamics. A significant challenge in optical trap arrays is to achieve site-resolved, point-to-point tunability: adjusting the laser parameters of a single trap typically induces global cross-talk to neighboring sites, hindering independent control. Inspired by tunable couplers in superconducting circuits, we implement an ancillary nanoparticle that functions as a coupler between two target nanoparticles. Within a reconfigurable three-particle array, we demonstrate broad tunability of the direct dipole-dipole interaction by controlling the phase and position of the traps. In addition, we observe spectral signatures consistent with mediated interactions between the target particles via the ancillary one, manifested as mode participation beyond the uncoupled response. Our results establish a practical route to tailored, site-resolved control in multi-particle optical trap arrays, expanding the optical-binding toolbox and opening opportunities for programmable oscillator networks relevant to macroscopic quantum mechanics and precision sensing.</p>

            <h2>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini</p>
            <p>Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</p>

            <h2>Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn</p>
            <p>We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</p>

Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spin-contaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density functional approximations (DFAs) confirms the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall but also reveals notable exceptions: functional performance for frequencies and electric-field properties correlates poorly with that for other ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the meta-GGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guglielmo Grimaldi, Matthew Headrick, Veronika E. Hubeny</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</p>

It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies. The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors. Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.</p>

            <p>Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuumś Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

Recent work analyzed stationary properties of multichannel Dicke superradiance using hydrodynamic mean-field approximations as shown by Mok et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L022015 (2025)]. We extend this with a symbolic quantum-trajectory method, providing a simple route to analytic solutions. For two channels, the behavior of the stationary ground-state distribution resembles a first-order phase transition at the point where the channel-rate ratio is equal to unity. For $d$ competing channels, we obtain scaling laws for the superradiant peak time and intensity. These results unify and extend single-channel Dicke dynamics to multilevel emitters and provide a compact tool for cavity and waveguide experiments, where permutation-symmetric reservoirs engineer multiple collective decay paths.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic structures are an excellent platform for controllable single-photon scattering. The tunable light-matter interaction enables the construction of a single-photon switch -- a device that can route a single photon from an input port to a selected output port. Such single-photon switching devices can be integrated into reconfigurable photonic circuits to actively control the photon propagation direction in a quantum network. Ideally, a single-photon switch should be fast, efficient, scalable, compatible with existing technology, and should preserve the routed photon states with high fidelity. In this review, we focus on theoretical proposals and experimental demonstrations of single-photon switches based on quantum emitters coupled to solid-state nanostructures, including waveguide and cavity architectures. We also present the theoretical methods that are commonly used to model single-photon scattering in waveguide-based systems by applying them to the elementary system of a two-level emitter coupled to a waveguide. This review brings together key theoretical techniques from quantum optics, their applications to controllable single-photon transport, and the experimental realization of single-photon switching devices across different physical platforms, including semiconductor quantum dots, neutral atoms, superconducting qubits, and color centers.</p>

As a result, non-chaotic systems can generate exponential or even maximal operator growth, and chaotic systems can show sub-exponential growth; we give examples of both.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishna Kingkar Pathak</p>
            <p>Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling. Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx 2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about $0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models, while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative to full multidimensional quantum treatments.</p>

            <h2>Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Abraham</p>
            <p>Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories: chiral anomaly in the finite temperature massless Schwinger model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Florio, Sara Murciano</p>
            <p>The entanglement asymmetry has emerged in recent years as a practical quantity to study phases of matter. We present the first study of entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories by considering the chiral anomaly of the analytically solvable massless Schwinger model at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Ridley, Eliahu Cohen, Christian Flindt, Riku Tuovinen</p>
            <p>The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode (MZM)-supporting nanoscale devices is determined by the time taken for electrons to traverse the device. We employ the time-dependent Landauer-B{ü}ttiker transport theory for current cross-lead correlations in a superconducting nanowire junction hosting MZMs. From the time-dependent quantum noise, we are able to extract traversal times for electrons crossing the system. After demonstrating a linear scaling of traversal times with nanowire length, we present a heuristic formula for the traversal times which accurately captures their behaviour. We then connect our framework to a proposed experimental verification of this discriminant between spurious and genuine MZMs utilizing time-resolved transport measurements.</p>

            <h2>Federated Quantum Kernel Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Time-Series</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Chen-Yu Liu, Kin K. Leung</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap, we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed, privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.</p>

            <p>When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking n-alk-1-ynes Conformers: Quantum "Trigger Finger" versus "Stiff Joint" Conformations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioan Bâldea</p>
            <p>Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.</p>

            <h2>Post-quench relaxation dynamics of Gross-Neveu lattice fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domenico Giuliano, Reinhold Egger, Bidyut Dey, Andrea Nava</p>
            <p>We study the quantum relaxation dynamics for a lattice version of the one-dimensional (1D) $N$-flavor Gross-Neveu (GN) model after a Hamiltonian parameter quench. Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\gamma$, we numerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent self-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\gamma=0$) finite-size system subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter dynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our results imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However, time-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if $\gamma>0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the post-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Ghosh, Patrick Brosseau, Dmitry N. Dirin, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Patanjali Kambhampati</p>
            <p>Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo D'Anna, Jannes Nys, Juan Carrasquilla</p>
            <p>The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, Daniel Liang</p>
            <p>We give a pair of algorithms that efficiently learn a quantum state prepared by Clifford gates and $O(\log n)$ non-Clifford gates. Specifically, for an $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ prepared with at most $t$ non-Clifford gates, our algorithms use $\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$ time and copies of $|\psi\rangle$ to learn $|\psi\rangle$ to trace distance at most $\varepsilon$. The first algorithm for this task is more efficient, but requires entangled measurements across two copies of $|\psi\rangle$. The second algorithm uses only single-copy measurements at the cost of polynomial factors in runtime and sample complexity. Our algorithms more generally learn any state with sufficiently large stabilizer dimension, where a quantum state has stabilizer dimension $k$ if it is stabilized by an abelian group of $2^k$ Pauli operators. We also develop an efficient property testing algorithm for stabilizer dimension, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>In this work we explore how different types of resources are distributed among the states generated by quantum random circuits (QRC). We focus on multipartite non-locality, but we also analyze quantum correlations by appealing to different entanglement and non-classicality measures. We analyze the violation of Mermin and Svetlichny inequalities in order to get a glance at the distribution of nonlocality and genuine multipartite nonlocality. Next, we compare universal vs non-universal sets of gates, to gain insight into the problem of explaining quantum advantage. By comparing the results obtained with ideal (noiseless) vs noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we lay the basis of a certification protocol, which aims to quantify how robust is the resources distribution among the states that a given device can generate. We have implemented our non-locality-based benchmark on actual quantum processors with different architectures, in order to assess up to which point they are capable of reproducing the ideal results.</p>

            <p>We analyze the existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points in simple bosonic systems - comprising up to six modes with damping and/or amplification - under two complementary scenarios to those described in arXiv:2405.01666: (i) nonconventional PT-symmetric dynamics confined to a subspace of the full Liouville space, and (ii) systems featuring unidirectional coupling.} The system dynamics described by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is governed by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points with up to sixth-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed, though relevant only for short-time dynamics. This raises the question of whether higher-order inherited singularities exist in bosonic systems under general conditions. Nevertheless, for short times, unidirectional coupling of various types enables the concatenation of simple bosonic systems with second- and third-order exceptional degeneracies such that arbitrarily high exceptional degeneracies are reached. Methods for numerical identifying the quantum exceptional and hybrid points together with their degeneracies are addressed. Following arXiv:2405.01666 rich dynamics of second-order field-operator moments is analyzed from the point of view of the presence of exceptional and diabolical points and their degeneracies.</p>

            <p>WiFi-based indoor localization is essential for asset tracking, healthcare monitoring, and smart buildings. However, existing systems face challenges such as data variability, environmental noise, and difficulty detecting floor and building levels, compounded by limited labeled data and high received signal strength (RSS) collection costs. This paper introduces quantum stochastic contrast learning (QSCL), a novel framework grounded in rigorous theoretical foundations. We present four theorems and one lemma that establish the probabilistic augmentation, diversity enhancement, relationship preservation, and resilience of QSCL under quantum noise, supported by formal proofs. Leveraging these foundations, QSCL utilizes quantum computing (QC) to generate strong data augmentations with stochastic perturbations, enhancing data diversity, while classical weak augmentations provide subtle variations for robust feature learning. We propose a spatial temporal adaptive attention (STAA) encoder that integrates convolutional layers with adaptive attention mechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data. Furthermore, a bidirectional contrastive loss function is introduced to capture forward and reverse relationships between augmented views, ensuring robust representations. Comprehensive evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc datasets validate QSCL, demonstrating superior performance with reduced labeled data and resilience to quantum noise such as bit-flip, dephasing, and measurement noise. The proposed framework significantly improves localization accuracy, floor and building detection, and generalizability in challenging indoor environments.</p>

            <p>A diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) is a generative model renowned for its ability to produce high-quality outputs in tasks such as image and audio generation. However, training DPMs on large, high-dimensional datasets such as high-resolution images or audio incurs significant computational, energy, and hardware costs. In this work, we introduce efficient quantum algorithms for implementing DPMs through various quantum ODE solvers. These algorithms highlight the potential of quantum Carleman linearization for diverse mathematical structures, leveraging state-of-the-art quantum linear system solvers (QLSS) or linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (LCHS). Specifically, we focus on two approaches: DPM-solver-$k$ which employs exact $k$-th order derivatives to compute a polynomial approximation of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$; and UniPC which uses finite difference of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$ at different points $(x_{s_m}, \lambda_{s_m})$ to approximate higher-order derivatives. As such, this work represents one of the most direct and pragmatic applications of quantum algorithms to large-scale machine learning models, presumably taking substantial steps towards demonstrating the practical utility of quantum computing.</p>

We apply the method to the semiclassical Rabi model and provide explicit error bounds for both the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian and its third-order refinement. Our analysis shows that, while the rotating-wave approximation more accurately captures the true dynamics than the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian in most regimes, the third-order approximation ultimately outperforms both.</p>

            <p>Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.</p>

In this work, we show for the first time that the universal quantum circuit synthesis problem can be reduced to maximum model counting. We formulate a #SAT encoding for exact and approximate depth-optimal quantum circuit synthesis into the Clifford+T gate set. We evaluate our method with an open-source implementation that uses the maximum model counter d4Max as a backend. For this purpose, we extended d4Max with support for complex and negative weights to represent amplitudes. Experimental results show that existing classical tools have potential for the quantum circuit synthesis problem.</p>

            <p>The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and computational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the correlated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to calculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum computing use case in materials science.</p>
