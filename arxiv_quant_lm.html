            <p>The last two decades has seen quantum thermodynamics become a well established field of research in its own right. In that time, it has demonstrated a remarkably broad applicability, ranging from providing foundational advances in the understanding of how thermodynamic principles apply at the nano-scale and in the presence of quantum coherence, to providing a guiding framework for the development of efficient quantum devices. Exquisite levels of control have allowed state-of-the-art experimental platforms to explore energetics and thermodynamics at the smallest scales which has in turn helped to drive theoretical advances. This Roadmap provides an overview of the recent developments across many of the field's sub-disciplines, assessing the key challenges and future prospects, providing a guide for its near term progress.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Pulse Design in Floquet Engineering: Application to Interacting Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Scott, Bryce Gadway, V. W. Scarola</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high frequency pulses to dynamically design steady state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a non-stroboscopic high frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</p>

            <h2>Superradiance in dense atomic samples</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. M de Araújo, H. Sanchez, L. F. Alves da Silva, M. H. Y. Moussa</p>
            <p>Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.</p>

            <h2>Multimode Entangled Squeezed Light Generation and Propagation in a Coupled-Cavity Photonic Crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan van Eeden, Marc M. Dignam</p>
            <p>We present an efficient and accurate method for modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in lossy coupled-cavity systems. We apply our approach to the design and modeling of a multimode photonic crystal coupled-cavity system for the generation of entangled squeezed states of light on-chip. The system consists of a three-mode, three-defect resonant structure coupled to three coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) in a square lattice silicon photonic crystal slab. We model the system using a basis of 184 non-orthogonal lossy quasi-modes. A two-mode squeezed thermal state of light is generated via degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing in the resonant structure, which is pumped with a Gaussian pulse via a pump-CROW. The generated entangled signal and idler pulses of light are coupled out of the resonant structure into the two output-CROWs. Due to careful design of the resonant structure and the CROWs, the signal and idler light in the two output CROWs remains entangled even after propagating tens of cavities down the CROWs. Our approach is general and computationally efficient and thus can be applied to modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in a wide variety of coupled-cavity photonic structures.</p>

            <h2>Coherent State Assisted Entanglement Generation Between Quantum Memories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chaohan Cui, Prajit Dhara, Saikat Guha</p>
            <p>Generating entanglement deterministically at a capacity-approaching rate is critical for next-generation quantum networks. We propose weak-coherent-state-assisted protocols that can generate entanglement near-deterministically between reflective-cavity-based quantum memories at a success rate that exceeds the 50\% limit associated with single-photon-mediated schemes. The most pronounced benefit is shown in the low-channel-loss regime and persists even with moderate noise. We extend our protocols to entangle an array of memories in a GHZ state, and infer that it yields an exponential speed-up compared to previous single-photon-based protocols.</p>

            <h2>Petz recovery maps of single-qubit decoherence channels in an ion trap quantum processor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Han Png, Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>The Petz recovery map provides a near-optimal reversal of quantum noise, yet proposals for its implementation are only recent. We propose a physical realization of the exact state-specific Petz map in an ion trap for qubit decoherence channels. Our circuit constructions require at most $1 (2)$ ancilla qubits and $3 (20)$ CNOT gates for channels with Kraus rank $2 (>2)$. We analyze typical ion trap errors and construct corresponding Petz maps, simulating their performance under realistic noise modeled by residual spin-motion coupling. Quantum circuits are provided for depolarizing, dephasing, and amplitude damping channels. Focusing on single-shot recovery, suited for present-day devices, we also quantify the precision of prior knowledge required to achieve a recovery error below 0.01 across varying decoherence levels and state purities.</p>

            <h2>Initialization of Neutral and Charged Exciton Spin States in a Telecom-Emitting Quantum Dot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giora Peniakov, Johannes Michl, Mohamed Helal, Raphael Joos, Michael Jetter, Simone L. Portalupi, Peter Michler, Sven Höfling, Tobias Huber-Loyola</p>
            <p>Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memory-less quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}>6.4$ ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.</p>

            <h2>The role of dark polariton states for electronic strong coupling in molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Borges, Thomas Schnappinger, Markus Kowalewski</p>
            <p>Polaritonic chemistry investigates the possible modification of chemical and photochemical reactions by means of strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities, as demonstrated in numerous experiments over the last few years. These experiments are typically interpreted in terms of the Jaynes-Cummings or Tavis-Cummings models under the assumption that the molecular ensemble is only excited by a single photon. In such a model, two polariton states compete with an overwhelming number of dark states, inhibiting polaritonic reactions entropically. We analyze the higher excitation manifolds of the Tavis-Cummings model along with a three-level system that resembles photochemical reactions. We demonstrate that allowing for more than a single excitation makes the reaction of the involved polaritons entropically more favorable.</p>

            <h2>Field energy and angular momentum in spontaneous emission: A Schrödinger-picture approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. R. Berman (1), A. Kuzmich (1), P. W Milonni (2) ((1) University of Michigan, (2) University of Rochester)</p>
            <p>A Schrödinger-picture approach is used to calculate the field energy and angular momentum radiated by an atom undergoing spontaneous emission. The calculation is carried out using both the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). It is shown that a consistent application of the WWA leads to expressions for both the energy and angular momentum in the field that are finite for all times, in contrast to the results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Moreover, it is shown that the total angular momentum in the field is a sum of its spin and orbital components, again in contrast to the analogous results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Analytic expressions for the energy, spin angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum in the field are obtained for an atom undergoing spontaneous emission from a state having angular momentum H to a state having angular momentum G via an electric dipole transition. It is shown that the spin and orbital angular momenta in the field are equal, independent of the values of H and G. With a slight modification of the WWA, it can also be shown that the energy density in the field, the Poynting vector of the field, and the angular momentum flux of the field do not diverge at the origin.</p>

            <h2>Language Model for Large-Text Transmission in Noisy Quantum Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Li, Zhouhang Shi, Haitao Ma, Li Shen, Jinge Bao, Yunlong Xiao</p>
            <p>Quantum communication has the potential to revolutionize information processing, providing unparalleled security and increased capacity compared to its classical counterpart by using the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the presence of noise remains a major barrier to realizing these advantages. While strategies like quantum error correction and mitigation have been developed to address this challenge, they often come with substantial overhead in physical qubits or sample complexity, limiting their practicality for large-scale information transfer. Here, we present an alternative approach: applying machine learning frameworks from natural language processing to enhance the performance of noisy quantum communications, focusing on superdense coding. By employing bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), a model known for its capabilities in natural language processing, we demonstrate improvements in information transfer efficiency without resorting to conventional error correction or mitigation techniques. These results mark a step toward the practical realization of a scalable and resilient quantum internet.</p>

            <h2>A Complete Characterization of Passive Unitary Normalizable (PUN) Gaussian States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiju Cherian John, Hemant K. Mishra, Saikat Guha</p>
            <p>We provide a complete characterization of the class of multimode quantum Gaussian states that can be reduced to a tensor product of thermal states using only a passive unitary operator. We call these states \textit{passive unitary normalizable} (PUN) Gaussian states. The characterization of PUN Gaussian states is given in three different ways: $(i)$ in terms of their covariance matrices, $(ii)$ using gauge-invariance (a special class of Glauber--Sudarshan $p$-functions), and $(iii)$ with respect to the recently obtained $(A,\Lambda)$ parametrization of Gaussian states in [J. Math. Phys. 62, 022102 (2021)]. In terms of the covariance matrix, our characterization states that an $n$-mode quantum Gaussian state is PUN if and only if its $2n\times 2n$ quantum covariance matrix $S$ commutes with the standard symplectic matrix $J$. It is well-known that the so-called gauge-invariant Gaussian states are PUN, but whether the converse is true is not known in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We establish the converse in affirmation. Lastly, in terms of the $(A,\Lambda)$-parameterization, we show that a Gaussian state with parameters $(A,\Lambda)$ is PUN if and only if $A=0$.</p>

            <h2>Localized Fock Space Cages in Kinetically Constrained Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheryne Jonay, Frank Pollmann</p>
            <p>We investigate a mechanism for non-ergodic behavior in many-body quantum systems arising from destructive interference, leading to localization in Fock space. Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Linear optical architectures have been extensively investigated for quantum computing and quantum machine learning applications. Recently, proposals for photonic quantum machine learning have combined linear optics with resource adaptivity, such as adaptive circuit reconfiguration, which promises to enhance expressivity and improve algorithm performances and scalability. Moreover, linear optical platforms preserve some subspaces due to the fixed number of particles during the computation, a property recently exploited to design a novel quantum convolutional neural networks. This last architecture has shown an advantage in terms of running time complexity and of the number of parameters needed with respect to other quantum neural network proposals. In this work, we design and experimentally implement the first photonic quantum convolutional neural network (PQCNN) architecture based on particle-number preserving circuits equipped with state injection, an approach recently proposed to increase the controllability of linear optical circuits. Subsequently, we experimentally validate the PQCNN for a binary image classification on a photonic platform utilizing a semiconductor quantum dot-based single-photon source and programmable integrated photonic interferometers comprising 8 and 12 modes. In order to investigate the scalability of the PQCNN design, we have performed numerical simulations on datasets of different sizes. We highlight the potential utility of a simple adaptive technique for a nonlinear Boson Sampling task, compatible with near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the Dani-Mainkar construction, we extend the notion of independence polynomial of graphs to arbitrary 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras.

As an application, we derive elementary bounds for the dimension of abelian subalgebras of 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras.</p>

            <h2>Phase-locking in dynamical systems and quantum mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artem Alexandrov, Alexey Glutsyuk, Alexander Gorsky</p>
            <p>In this study, we discuss the Prufer transform that connects the dynamical system on the torus and the Hill equation, which is interpreted as either the equation of motion for the parametric oscillator or the Schrodinger equation with periodic potential. The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits. Our picture is supported by numerical simulations for the model of the Josephson junction and Mathieu equation.</p>

            <h2>Probing the Quantum Speed Limit and Entanglement in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System in Curved Spacetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Kumar Jha, Mriganka Dutta, Mayank Pathak, Subhashish Banerjee, Banibrata Mukhopadhyay</p>
            <p>We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</p>

            <h2>CloudQC: A Network-aware Framework for Multi-tenant Distributed Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruilin Zhou, Yuhang Gan, Yi Liu, Chen Qian</p>
            <p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) that allows a large quantum circuit to be executed simultaneously on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) becomes a promising approach to increase the scalability of quantum computing. It is natural to envision the near-future DQC platform as a multi-tenant cluster of QPUs, called a Quantum Cloud. However, no existing DQC work has addressed the two key problems of running DQC in a multi-tenant quantum cloud: placing multiple quantum circuits to QPUs and scheduling network resources to complete these jobs. This work is the first attempt to design a circuit placement and resource scheduling framework for a multi-tenant environment. The proposed framework is called CloudQC, which includes two main functional components, circuit placement and network scheduler, with the objectives of optimizing both quantum network cost and quantum computing time. Experimental results with real quantum circuit workloads show that CloudQC significantly reduces the average job completion time compared to existing DQC placement algorithms for both single-circuit and multi-circuit DQC. We envision this work will motivate more future work on network-aware quantum cloud.</p>

            <p>Conditioning is a key feature in probabilistic programming to enable modeling the influence of data (also known as observations) to the probability distribution described by such programs. Determining the posterior distribution is also known as Bayesian inference. This paper equips a quantum while-language with conditioning, defines its denotational and operational semantics over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and shows their equivalence. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of weakest (liberal) precondition-transformers and derive inductive characterizations of these transformers. It is shown how w(l)p-transformers can be used to assess the effect of Bayesian inference on (possibly diverging) quantum programs.</p>

Specifically, we elucidate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ non-Hermitian topological phases and their associated anomalous boundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.</p>

            <p>Predictive maintenance in aerospace heavily relies on accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of jet engines. In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network frame- work, combining Quantum Long Short-Term Memory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset. Each Quantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear transformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to learn high-frequency components more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent Neural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough comparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our approach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these baselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively. Nevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures. Our findings highlight the poten- tial of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for robust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new avenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.</p>

            <h2>Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in Silicon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Gawełczyk, K. Gawarecki</p>
            <p>Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.</p>

            <p>We propose a procedure to identify and classify genuine tripartite entanglement in pure 3-qubit states via the Activated Bipartite Entanglement (ABE), which is defined here as the difference between the Entanglement of Assistance and the Entanglement of Formation. We show that for pure states belonging to one of the two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e., GHZ or W states, the ABE is always greater than zero. For separable and biseparable states it is always null. In addition, our approach is capable to distinguish between genuine tripartite entangled states, those belonging to the GHZ-class from those belonging to the W-class. We also present an experimental proposal, by using linear optical circuits and internal degrees of freedom of a single photon, to measure the ABE and to verify the characterization via activated entanglement. The circuit simulation shows an excellent agreement with theoretical prediction for a wide class of GHZ and W states.</p>

            <h2>Random Pulse Sequences for Qubit Noise Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaixin Huang, Demitry Farfurnik, Alireza Seif, Mohammad Hafezi, Yi-Kai Liu</p>
            <p>Qubit noise spectroscopy is an important tool for the experimental investigation of open quantum systems. However, conventional techniques for noise spectroscopy are time-consuming, because they require measurements of the noise spectral density at many different frequencies. Here we describe an alternative approach to noise spectroscopy, which requires fewer resources, and relies on direct measurement of arbitrary linear functionals of the noise spectral density. This method uses random pulse sequences with carefully-controlled correlations, which are chosen using algorithms for phase retrieval. These measurements allow us to reconstruct sparse noise spectra via compressed sensing. Our simulations of the performance of the random pulse sequences on a realistic physical system, self-assembled quantum dots, reveal a speedup of an order of magnitude in extracting the noise spectrum, compared to conventional dynamical decoupling approaches.</p>

            <h2>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark Xin Hong Goh</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erdös--Rényi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</p>

            <p>In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of popular SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers (that is transpilers that takes a quantum circuit from an initial SDK and output a quantum circuit in another SDK), focusing on critical metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time. To ensure unbiased evaluation and accommodate diverse quantum computing scenarios, we developed two dedicated tools: RandomQC, for generating random quantum circuits across various types (pure random, VQE-like, and SDK-specific circuits), and Benchmarq, to streamline the benchmarking process. Using these tools, we benchmarked prominent quantum transpilers as of February 2024. Our results highlight the superior performance of the qiskit-braket-provider, a specialized transpiler from Qiskit to Braket, achieving a remarkably low failure rate of 0.2%. The qBraid-SDK, offering generalized transpilation across multiple SDKs, demonstrated robust but slower performance. The pytket extensions, while fast, faced limitations with complex circuits due to their one-to-one transpilation approach. In particular, the exceptional performance of the qiskit-bracket-provider stems not only from its specialization but also from its architecture, which combines one-to-one transpilation with gate decomposition for unsupported gates, enhancing both speed and capability. This study aims to provide practical guidelines to users of SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers and guidance to developers for improving the design and development of future tools.</p>

            <p>An efficient implementation of the Toffoli gate is of conceptual importance for running various quantum algorithms, including Grover's search and Shor's integer factorization. However, direct implementation of the Toffoli gate either entails a prohibitive increase in the number of two-qubit gates or requires ancilla qubits, whereas both of these resources are limited in the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable $N$-qubit Toffoli gate improvement using $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ trapped-ion-based optical-metastable-ground encoded qutrits for the cases of up to $N$=10. With the use of the Molmer-Sorensen gate as a basic entangling operation, we compare the standard qubit decomposition with the qutrit approach, where upper levels are used as this http URL presented decomposition requires only global control of the ancilla levels, which simplifies experimental implementation of the proposed approach. Using the example of a three-qubit Grover's search, we also demonstrate an increase in the algorithm's accuracy by monitoring the leakage from the qubit subspace during a qutrit-based Toffoli gate implementation.</p>

            <p>Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</p>

            <p>Block Encoding (BE) is a crucial subroutine in many modern quantum algorithms, including those with near-optimal scaling for simulating quantum many-body systems, which often rely on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings. Using LOVE-LCU to implement the BE, we simulate the time evolution of single-site and two-site systems in the lattice $\varphi^4$ theory using the Generalized QSP algorithm and compare the gate counts to those required for Trotter simulation.</p>

            <p>Quantum control plays a crucial role in enhancing precision scaling for quantum sensing. However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with imperfect clocks, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg scaling up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex E. Bernardini, Orfeu Bertolami</p>
            <p>Extending the phase-space description of the Weyl-Wigner quantum mechanics to a subset of non-linear Hamiltonians in position and momentum, gaussian functions are identified as the quantum ground state. Once a Hamiltonian, $H^{W}(q,\,p)$, is constrained by the $\partial ^2 H^{W} / \partial q \partial p = 0$ condition, flow properties for generic $1$-dim systems can be analytically obtained in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. For gaussian statistical ensembles, the exact phase-space profile of the quantum fluctuations over the classical trajectories are found, so to interpret them as a suitable Hilbert space state configuration for confronting quantum and classical regimes. In particular, a sort of {\em quantum camouflage} where the stationarity of classical statistical ensembles can be camouflaged by the stationarity of gaussian quantum ensembles is identified. Besides the broadness of the framework worked out in some previous examples, our results provide an encompassing picture of quantum effects on non-linear dynamical systems which can be interpreted as a first step for finding the complete spectrum of non-standard Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengsi Mao, Changhao Yi, Huangjun Zhu</p>
            <p>Shadow estimation is a sample-efficient protocol for learning the properties of a quantum system using randomized measurements, but the current understanding of qudit shadow estimation is quite limited compared with the qubit setting. Here we clarify the sample complexity of qudit shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, where the local dimension $d$ is an odd prime. Notably, we show that the overhead of qudit shadow estimation over the qubit counterpart is only $\mathcal{O}(d)$, independent of the qudit number $n$, although the set of stabilizer states may deviate exponentially from a 3-design with respect to the third moment operator. Furthermore, by adding one layer of magic gates, we propose a simple circuit that can significantly boost the efficiency. Actually, a single magic gate can already eliminate the $\mathcal{O}(d)$ overhead in qudit shadow estimation and bridge the gap from the qubit setting.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in space science and technologies offer exciting prospects for investigating novel research that is unattainable within terrestrial laboratories. Here we propose the implementation of space-based quantum sensing to explore ultralight new particles beyond the standard model. The central idea involves probing long-range interactions between spin ensembles of space quantum sensors and the particles residing within Earth, mediated by ultralight particles. We show that such interactions can be substantially enhanced in space platforms and thus increase the search sensitivity. In contrast to their terrestrial counterparts, space-based quantum searches exhibit remarkable velocity enhancements, approaching the first cosmic speed, and thus enables the exploration of unexplored parameter space concerning ultralight new particles. Furthermore, the substantial abundance of electrons and nucleons within Earth plays a crucial role in extending the scope of our mission. Our projected search sensitivity can surpass the sensitivities of both terrestrial experiments and proposals by up to approximately 7 orders of magnitude. We also briefly discuss other space mission, including ``space-ground integrated" network of quantum sensors for dark matter searches.</p>

            <p>Trapped ion systems present non-classical characteristics such as squeezed states that show a quantum advantage in quantum sensing, quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics. We analyze the non-classical characteristics of a system described by a single ion trapped by a periodic potential field. Within the regime of non-adiabatic manipulation of the potential field, the dynamics of motion of the center of mass of the ion can be described by a dimensionless parameter called the non-adiabatic parameter $Q^{*}$. This parameter allows us to distinguish the classical and non-classical characteristics of the system. Using the equations of motion of observables in the Heisenberg picture, we propose an analysis of the unitary time evolution operator and discuss the squeezing behavior in the state of motion of the ion. The results shown can serve as a basis to discuss the presence of squeezing as a resource in quantum thermodynamics in the non-adiabatic regime in actual achievable experimental limitations.</p>

            <p>Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</p>

            <p>Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic entanglement, as a critical quantum resource in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth depends on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer with a movable membrane. This configuration enables the switching between coherent and dissipative optomechanical couplings at will. With experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power under coherent (dissipative) coupling. Furthermore, we show that the quantum entanglement generated via dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more robust to noise than that generated via coherent coupling. When both coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously present, the entanglement is weakened due to quantum interference. Our results indicate that dissipative optomechanical coupling can be a promising route for engineering strong and noise-resilient quantum entanglement.</p>

We then apply our theory to the study of the optical response of two plasmonic systems. Furthermore, by exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</p>

            <p>Polarization-entangled photons are the key ingredients of various protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. A near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is essential to minimize qubit error rates in key distribution. This study theoretically investigates the polarization entangled photon pairs produced by a quantum-dot radiative cascade located within a micropillar cavity. To incorporate the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling in a quantum dot-cavity system, we develop a polaron master equation theory and investigate how it affects the degree of entanglement and qubit error rate. We derive analytical expressions of various phonon-induced incoherent rates and demonstrate that one-photon incoherent rates predominate, substantially diminishing the degree of entanglement. It is shown that at elevated temperatures, the role of cavity-mediated effects such as cross-coupling between exciton states, ac-Stark shift, and multiphoton emission gets reduced owing to the phonon-mediated renormalization of the cavity coupling and Rabi frequency. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol and show the evolution of qubit error rate at elevated temperatures of the phonon bath.</p>

            <p>We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuchuan Wei, Zi-Wen Liu</p>
            <p>Understanding nonstabilizerness (aka quantum magic) in many-body quantum systems, particularly its interplay with entanglement, represents an important quest in quantum computation and many-body physics. Drawing natural motivations from the study of quantum phases of matter and entanglement, we systematically investigate the notion of long-range magic (LRM), defined as nonstabilizerness that cannot be (approximately) erased by shallow local unitary circuits. In doing so, we prove a robust generalization of the Bravyi--König theorem. By establishing connections to the theory of fault-tolerant logical gates on quantum error-correcting codes, we show that certain families of topological stabilizer code states exhibit LRM. Then, we show that all ground states of topological orders that cannot be realized by topological stabilizer codes, such as Fibonacci topological order, exhibit LRM, which yields a ``no lowest-energy trivial magic'' result. Building on our considerations of LRM, we discuss the classicality of short-range magic from e.g.~preparation and learning perspectives, and put forward a ``no low-energy trivial magic'' (NLTM) conjecture that has key motivation in the quantum PCP context. We also connect correlation functions with LRM, demonstrating certain LRM state families by correlation properties. Most of our concepts and techniques do not rely on geometric locality and can be extended to systems with general connectivity. Our study leverages and sheds new light on the interplay between quantum resources, error correction and fault tolerance, complexity theory, and many-body physics.</p>

            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of up to $7.9 \pm 0.6$ dB, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest squeezing recorded for pulsed light. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.</p>

Researchers claim this is indecipherable and have stated a no-go theorem for post-processed bit-streams [Physical Review A \textbf{109}, 022243 (2024)]. In this article, we corroborate the results of the no-go theorem while discussing its nuances using two different random number generators and four test methods.

            <h2>Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xulong Wang, Guancong Ma</p>
            <p>The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other. However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes. Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in non-Hermitian phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Reducing quantum error correction overhead using soft information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonas Majaniemi, Elisha S. Matekole</p>
            <p>Imperfect measurements are a prevalent source of error across quantum computing platforms, significantly degrading the logical error rates achievable on current hardware. To mitigate this issue, rich measurement data referred to as soft information has been proposed to efficiently identify and correct measurement errors as they occur. In this work, we model soft information decoding across a variety of physical qubit platforms and decoders and showcase how soft information can make error correction viable at lower code distances and higher physical error rates than is otherwise possible. We simulate the effects of soft information decoding on quantum memories for surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes, and evaluate the error suppression performance of soft decoders against traditional decoders. For near-term devices with noise regimes close to the surface code threshold, our simulations show that soft information decoding can provide up to 10% higher error suppression on superconducting qubits and up to 20% stronger error suppression on neutral atom qubits.</p>

            <p>Multi-target gates offer the potential to reduce gate depth in syndrome extraction for quantum error correction. Although neutral-atom quantum computers have demonstrated native multi-qubit gates, existing approaches that avoid additional control or multiple atomic species have been limited to single-target gates. We propose single-control-multi-target CZ^{\otimes N}) gates on a single-species neutral-atom platform that require no extra control and have gate durations comparable to standard CZ gates. Our approach leverages tailored interatomic distances to create an asymmetric blockade between the control and target atoms. Using a GPU-accelerated pulse synthesis protocol, we design smooth control pulses for CZZ and CZZZ gates, achieving fidelities of up to 99.55% and 99.24%, respectively, even in the presence of simulated atom placement errors and Rydberg-state decay. This work presents a practical path to implementing multi-target gates in neutral-atom systems, significantly reducing the resource overhead for syndrome extraction.</p>

            <p>We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</p>

            <p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations and identifying governing equations from observational data. In this study, we apply PINNs to investigate vortex-type solutions of quasi-integrable equations in two spatial dimensions, specifically the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equations. These equations are toy models for geostrophic shallow water dynamics in planetary atmospheres. We first demonstrate that PINNs can successfully solve these equations in the forward process using a mesh-free approach with automatic differentiation. However, in the inverse process, substantial misidentification occurs due to the structural similarities between the ZK and the RLW equations. To address this issue, we then introduce conservation law-enhanced PINNs, initial condition variations, and a friction-based perturbation approach to improve identification accuracy. Our results show that incorporating small perturbations while preserving conservation laws significantly enhances the resolution of equation identification. These findings may contribute to the broader goal of using deep learning techniques for discovering governing equations in complex fluid dynamical systems, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-André-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents. The bulk-boundary correspondence is investigated by analyzing the existence of localized edge states under the open boundary condition.</p>

            <h2>Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhikbrata Sarkar, Pratik Chowdhury, Xuedong Hu, Andre Saraiva, A. S. Dzurak, A. R. Hamilton, Rajib Rahman, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</p>

            <p>Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems, such as a single-mode cavity field coupled to a thermal bath, typically experience destructive effects due to interactions with their noisy environment. When the bath combines both thermal fluctuations and a nonclassical feature like quadrature squeezing, forming a squeezed thermal reservoir, the system's behaviour can change substantially. In this work, we study the evolution of the cavity field in this generalized environment using an alternative phase-space approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We derive a compact analytical expression for the time-dependent $P$-function for arbitrary initial cavity field states and demonstrate its utility through specific examples. Additionally, we obtain analytical expressions, as a function of time, for some statistical properties of the cavity field, as well as for the nonclassical depth, $\tau_m$, a nonclassicality measure calculated directly from the $P$-function.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waltraut Wustmann, Kevin D. Osborn</p>
            <p>The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</p>

Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi Model to a sum over $n$ binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with $n$ spin sites, where $n$ is also the number of steps in Trotter's formula. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice-versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.</p>

            <p>Given a finite lifetime, a ubiquitous challenge in quantum systems is how to prepare a target state in the shortest possible time. This issue is particularly relevant for Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers where the dephasing time is typically restricted to a few microseconds. In this work, we develop a rapid passage to ordered many-body states in a Rydberg atomic chain, which allows the transition of the system to various ordered phases in the phase diagram, such as the Z$_2$-, Z$_3$-, and Z$_4$-ordered antiferromagnetic states. Our scheme ramps the parameter in a "non-adiabatic to quasi-adiabatic to non-adiabatic (NQN)" manner. The NQN configuration significantly reduces the time cost required for the state preparation using entirely adiabatic methods, and is generally appliable to sizable number of atoms. Moreover, we experimentally validate the NQN scheme on the neutral-atom quantum cloud computer Aquila.</p>

            <p>Trapped-ion qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum computing, quantum information processing, and quantum simulation. In general, trapped ions are considered to have sufficiently long coherence times, which are mainly characterized under laser-free conditions. However, in reality, essential laser fields for quantum manipulation introduce residual light shift, which seriously degrades the coherence due to power fluctuations. Here, we present a comprehensive study of AC Stark shifts in the hyperfine energy levels of the $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ ion, revealing an asymmetric light shift between two circular polarizations in the clock qubit and pronounced vector light shifts in the Zeeman qubits. By precisely tuning these polarizations, a remarkable enhancement in coherence time is observed, reaching over a hundredfold for the clock qubit and more than tenfold for the Zeeman qubits, when comparing conditions of maximum and minimum shifts. These findings advance the practical realization of scalable trapped-ion quantum processors, enabling deep quantum circuit execution and long duration adiabatic operations.</p>

            <p>Spatial entanglement is a key resource in quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum communication, imaging, and computation. However, propagation through complex media distorts spatial correlations, posing a challenge for practical implementations. We introduce a symmetrized genetic algorithm (sGA) for adaptive wavefront correction of spatially entangled photons, leveraging the insight that only the even-parity component of wavefront distortions affects two-photon correlations. By enforcing symmetry constraints, sGA reduces the optimization parameter space by half, leading to faster convergence and improved enhancement within finite number of generations compared to standard genetic algorithms (GA). Additionally, we establish the dependence of enhancement on the signal-to-noise ratio of the feedback signal, which is controlled by detector integration time. This technique enables correction of entanglement degradation, enhancing quantum imaging, secure quantum communication, and quantum sensing in complex environments.</p>

            <p>Neural network decoders are becoming essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computations. However, their internal mechanisms are poorly understood, hindering our ability to ensure their reliability and security against adversarial attacks. Leading machine learning decoders utilize recurrent and transformer models (e.g., AlphaQubit), with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a key role in training advanced transformer models (e.g., DeepSeek R1). In this work, we target a basic RL surface code decoder (DeepQ) to create the first adversarial attack on quantum error correction. By applying state-of-the-art white-box methods, we uncover vulnerabilities in this decoder, demonstrating an attack that reduces the logical qubit lifetime in memory experiments by up to five orders of magnitude. We validate that this attack exploits a genuine weakness, as the decoder exhibits robustness against noise fluctuations, is largely unaffected by substituting the referee decoder, responsible for episode termination, with an MWPM decoder, and demonstrates fault tolerance at checkable code distances. This attack highlights the susceptibility of machine learning-based QEC and underscores the importance of further research into robust QEC methods.</p>

            <p>Quantum algorithms require accurate representations of electronic states on a quantum device, yet the approximation of electronic wave functions for strongly correlated systems remains a profound theoretical challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance the competing demands of chemical accuracy and gate efficiency. Moreover, a critical limitation of the most of the state-of-the-art methods developed to date lies in their substantial reliance on extensive pre-circuit measurements, which introduce significant overheads and contribute to inefficiencies in practical implementation. To address these interconnected challenges and establish a harmonious synergy between them, we propose an algorithmic framework that focuses on efficiently capturing the molecular strong correlation through an ordered set of computationally less demanding rank-one and seniority-zero excitations, yielding a parameterized ansatz with shallow gate depth. Furthermore, to achieve minimal pre-circuit measurement overhead, we implement a selective pruning of excitations through a hybrid approach that combines intuition-based selection with shallow-depth, rank-one excitations driven uni-parameter circuit optimization strategy. With the incorporation of qubit-based excitations via particle-preserving exchange circuits, we demonstrate a further reduction in quantum complexities, enhancing the overall resource efficiency of the approach. With a range of challenging applications on strongly correlated systems, we demonstrate that our dynamic ansatz not only significantly enhances computational efficiency but also delivers exceptional accuracy, robustness, and resilience to the noisy environments inherent in near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is paramount in quantum information processing. Many quantum systems suffer from spatial decoherence in distances over a wavelength and cannot be sustained over short time periods due to dissipation. However, long range solutions are required for the development of quantum information processing on chip. Photonic reservoirs mediating the interactions between qubits and their environment are suggested. Recent research takes advantage of extended wavelength inside near-zero refractive index media to solve the long-range problem along with less sensitivity on the position of quantum emitters. However, those recent proposals use plasmonic epsilon near-zero waveguides that are intrinsically lossy. Here, we propose a fully dielectric platform, compatible with the Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) diamond centers on-chip technology, to drastically improve the range of entanglement over 17 free-space wavelengths, or approximatively 12.5 microns, using mu near-zero metamaterials. We evaluate transient and steady state concurrence demonstrating an order of magnitude enhancement compared to previous works. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a long distance is reported using this strategy. Moreover, value of the zero time delay second order correlation function g_12^((2)) (0) are provided, showing antibunching signature correlated with a high degree of concurrence.</p>

            <h2>Hamiltonian point of view of quantum perturbation theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. D. Bermúdez Manjarres</p>
            <p>We explore the relation of Van Vleck-Primas perturbation theory of quantum mechanics with the Lie-series-based perturbation theory of Hamiltonian systems in classical mechanics. In contrast to previous works on the relation of quantum and classical perturbation theories, our approach is not based on the conceptual similarities between the two methods. Instead, we show that for quantum systems with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, the Van Vleck-Primas procedure can be recast exactly into a classical perturbation problem. As a non-obvious consequence, this approach gives a new way of calculating the geometric phase of quantum systems using tools from the theory of classical canonical transformations</p>

            <h2>Bayesianism, Conditional Probability and Laplace Law of Succession in Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Ichikawa</p>
            <p>We present a comparative study between classical probability and quantum probability from the Bayesian viewpoint, where probability is construed as our rational degree of belief on whether a given statement is true. From this viewpoint, including conditional probability, three issues are discussed: i) Given a measure of the rational degree of belief, does it satisfy the axioms of the probability? ii) Given the probability satisfying these axioms, is it seen as the measure of the rational degree of belief? iii) Can the measure of the rational degree of belief be evaluated in terms of the relative frequency of events occurring? Here we show that as with the classical probability, all these issues can be resolved affirmatively in the quantum probability, provided that the relation to the relative frequency is slightly modified from the Laplace law of succession in case of a small number of observations. This implies that the relation between the Bayesian probability and the relative frequency in quantum mechanics is the same as that in the classical probability theory, including conditional probability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiyu Zhou, Yi Teng, Claudio Chamon, Claudio Castelnovo, Armin Rahmani</p>
            <p>We introduce a synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer for digitized quantum computing devices to probe fractional exchange statistics of anyonic excitations that appear in quantum spin liquids. Employing an IonQ quantum computer, we apply this scheme to the toric ladder, a quasi-one-dimensional reduction of the toric code. We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The ability to generate entangled states of light is a key primitive for quantum communication and distributed quantum computation. Continuously driven sources, including those based on spontaneous parametric downconversion, are usually probabilistic, whereas deterministic sources require accurate timing of the control fields. Here, we experimentally generate entangled photonic modes by continuously exciting a quantum emitter, a superconducting qubit, with a coherent drive, taking advantage of mode matching in the time and frequency domain. Using joint quantum state tomography and logarithmic negativity, we show that entanglement is generated between modes extracted from the two sidebands of the resonance fluorescence spectrum. Because the entangled photonic modes are perfectly orthogonal, they can be transferred into distinct quantum memories. Our approach can be utilized to distribute entanglement at a high rate in various physical platforms, with applications in waveguide quantum electrodynamics, distributed quantum computing, and quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up, due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine the necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</p>

Matheny, Oskar Painter</p>
            <p>Cat qubits, a type of bosonic qubit encoded in a harmonic oscillator, can exhibit an exponential noise bias against bit-flip errors with increasing mean photon number. Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic oscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large loss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade the coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to overcome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode with a multi-pole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account additional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve near-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon number, reaching over $0.1$ seconds with a mean photon number of only $4$. Concurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip times corresponding to an effective lifetime of $T_{1,\text{eff}} \simeq 70$ $\mu$s, comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this performance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out the cat qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive coupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode allows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control primitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction (e.g., two thirds) of a $3~\mathrm{\mu s}$ cycle without degrading bit-flip times. These advances are important for the realization of scalable error-correction with cat qubits, where large noise bias and low phase-flip error rate enable the use of hardware-efficient outer error-correcting codes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo: A Hybrid Approach to Data Assimilation in 4DVAR</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhiram Sripat</p>
            <p>We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QMCMC) with variational particle filters to tackle the computational challenges in Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation (4DVAR). 4DVAR, widely used in numerical weather prediction, suffers from inefficiencies in high-dimensional, non-linear systems. Our approach, the Quantum Variational Particle Filter (QVPF), uses QAOA to optimize particle proposals and QMCMC to efficiently compute particle weights and resample, accelerating convergence while reducing the computational load. The QVPF framework addresses the curse of dimensionality by minimizing the number of particles required for accurate state estimation, thus improving efficiency in systems with complex dynamics. The hybrid model offers enhanced accuracy by integrating quantum algorithms into the variational particle filter, making it particularly suited for applications in climate modeling, space weather prediction, and defense. The potential for achieving unprecedented resolution in predictive models could transform sectors that rely on high-resolution forecasting. We present the mathematical foundations of the approach, along with discussions on algorithmic implementation and hardware requirements. Early results suggest that this hybrid framework could significantly improve data assimilation, with future implementations on near-term quantum devices offering a practical pathway for scaling up. This work demonstrates how quantum computing can address the growing need for more accurate and computationally feasible methods in large-scale data assimilation.</p>

These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</p>

This result was obtained using a spin-dependent torque generated by a micro-diamond containing billions of NV centers, placed at the end of a commercially available silicon cantilever. %We demonstrate that the fundamental flexural mode of the cantilever is excited by the spins of the NV centers. These spins are uniformly coupled to an externally applied homogeneous magnetic field, which enables the NV centers to exert a measurable spin-dependent torque on the cantilever, driving its center of mass motion. Our experiment highlights the intricate interplay between the spin properties of NV centers and the mechanical behavior of the oscillator in the presence of a pure torque, providing a set of tools for exploring quantum effects in state of the art micro-mechanical systems.</p>

            <h2>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity: A perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anneswa Paul, Upendra Harbola</p>
            <p>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity and formation of polaritonic states have gained interest in the past decades as it has direct applications in many research fields. Different regimes of light-matter coupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is rotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling and near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \leq \lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \leq\lambda/\omega_c\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\lambda/\omega_c\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting has been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic states. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon coupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is not captured by RWA. In fact, RWA breaks down completely to predict the ground state properties as it fails to capture the interaction between the matter and the cavity field.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanul Gupta, Guido Masella, Francesco Mattiotti, Nikolay V. Prokof'ev, Guido Pupillo</p>
            <p>The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha > 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha>3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.</p>

            <p>Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose two new methods for solving Set Constraint Problems, as well as a potential polynomial solution for NP-Complete problems using quantum computation. While current methods of solving Set Constraint Problems focus on classical techniques, we offer both a quantum-inspired matrix method and a quantum matrix method that neutralizes common contradictions and inconsistencies that appear in these types of problems. We then use our new method to show how a potential polynomial solution for NP-Complete problems could be found using quantum computation. We state this as a potential solution, rather than an actual solution, as the outcome of any quantum computation may not be the same as the expected outcome. We start by formally defining a Set Constraint Problem. We then explain current, classical methods that are used to solve these problems and the drawbacks of such methods. After this, we explain a new quantum-inspired matrix method that allows us to solve these problems, with classical limitations. Then, we explain a new quantum matrix method that solves these problems using quantum information science. Finally, we describe how we can extend this method to potentially solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time using quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Statistical noise enhances quantumness benefits in spin-network quantum reservoir computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youssef Kora, Christoph Simon</p>
            <p>Quantum reservoir computing offers a promising approach to the utilization of complex quantum dynamics in machine learning. Statistical noise inevitably arises in real settings of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) due to the practical necessity of taking a small to moderate number of measurements. We investigate the effect of statistical noise in spin-network QRC on the possible performance benefits conferred by quantumness. As our measures of quantumness, we employ both quantum entanglement, which we quantify by the partial transpose of the density matrix, and coherence, which we quantify as the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. We find that reservoirs which enjoy a finite degree of quantum entanglement and coherence are more stable against the adverse effects of statistical noise on performance compared to their unentangled, incoherent counterparts. Our results indicate that the potential benefit reservoir computers may derive from quantumness depends on the number of measurements used for training and testing, and may indeed be enhanced by statistical noise. These findings not only emphasize the importance of incorporating realistic noise models, but also suggest that the search for quantum advantage may be aided rather than impeded by the practical constraints of implementation within existing machines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoukang Chang, Marco G. Genoni, Francesco Albarelli</p>
            <p>Multiparameter quantum estimation theory is crucial for many applications involving infinite-dimensional Gaussian quantum systems, since they can describe many physical platforms, e.g., quantum optical and optomechanical systems and atomic ensembles. In the multiparameter setting, the most fundamental estimation error (quantified by the trace of the estimator covariance matrix) is given by the Holevo Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB), which takes into account the asymptotic detrimental impact of measurement incompatibility on the simultaneous estimation of parameters encoded in a quantum state. However, the difficulty of evaluating the HCRB for infinite-dimensional systems weakens the practicality of applying this tool in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an efficient numerical method to evaluate the HCRB for general Gaussian states, by solving a semidefinite program involving only the covariance matrix and first moment vector and their parametric derivatives. This approach follows similar techniques developed for finite-dimensional systems, and hinges on a phase-space evaluation of inner products between observables that are at most quadratic in the canonical bosonic operators. From this vantage point, we can also understand symmetric and right logarithmic derivative scalar Cramér-Rao bounds under the same common framework, showing how they can similarly be evaluated as semidefinite programs. To exemplify the relevance and applicability of this methodology, we consider two paradigmatic applications, where the parameter dependence appears both in the first moments and in the covariance matrix of Gaussian states: estimation of phase and loss, and estimation of squeezing and displacement.</p>

We present a full-state vector simulation algorithm and software implementation designed to perform HPC simulation of layers of rotations around a string of Pauli operators.

Our distributed computation harnessed up to $16\,384$ CPU cores and $512$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs, using $32$ TB of memory. The simulator significantly outperforms other high-performance libraries, showing a typical speedup of $10-100$ for large-scale multi-GPU workloads. As a first application of our approach, we report a numerical experiment aimed at simulating exactly Hamiltonian dynamics of up to 40 qubits to investigate the Trotter error for a quantum chemistry problem. Bounding the Trotter error is important for evaluating the cost of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and rigorous bounds are often conservative, as our simulations confirm.

In addition to the intrinsic, inter-mode and extrinsic, cavity-mediated inter-mode delocalization, the vibrational modes undergo multiscale relaxation due to reservoir vibrations. Two complementary coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques are presented, which reveal the dynamical nature of the mode correlations in the presence relaxation. Simulations are presented for finite laser pulses. The chosen cavity-vibron mode coupling strengths fall within the range of inter-vibrational mode coupling, hinting at a parameter regime where vibrational energy dispersal can be controlled. It is highlighted that the cavity manipulation of vibrational double excitations, namely, overtone and combination states, can offer deeper insights into the collective mode dynamics. These observations set the ground for cavity-controlled spectroscopic investigation of mode-selective dynamics, where localized electromagnetic modes function as an effective few-body coupler of vibrations.</p>

Despite significant progresses in ground-state cooling of a levitated solid particle, realizing non-classical states of its motion has been elusive.

We reveal significant narrowing of the velocity variance to $-4.9(1)$~dB of that of the ground state via free-expansion measurements. To quantitatively confirm our finding, we develop a method to accurately measure the displacement of the nanoparticle by referencing an optical standing wave. Our work shows that a levitated nanoparticle offers an ideal platform for studying non-classical states of its motion and paves the way for its applications in quantum sensing, as well as for exploring quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale.</p>

A general GHZ state of $N$ Rydberg qubits can be prepared in $N-1$ steps, which is found to be robust against both environmental noises and systematic errors. Our protocol therefore provides an avenue towards large-scale entanglement, which is essential for quantum information and quantum computation based on neutral atoms.</p>

            <p>Quantum machine learning is an approach that aims to improve the performance of machine learning methods by leveraging the properties of quantum computers. In quantum circuit learning (QCL), a supervised learning method that can be implemented using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), the process of encoding input data into quantum states has been widely discussed for its important role on the expressive power of learning models. In particular, the properties of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian used for encoding significantly influence model performance. Recent encoding methods have demonstrated that the expressive power of learning models can be enhanced by applying exponentially large magnetic fields proportional to the number of qubits. However, this approach poses a challenge as it requires exponentially increasing magnetic fields, which are impractical for implementation in large-scale systems. Here, we propose a QCL method that leverages a non-integrable Hamiltonian for encoding, aiming to achieve both enhanced expressive power and practical feasibility. We find that the thermalization properties of non-integrable systems over long timescales, implying that the energy difference has a low probability to be degenerate, lead to an enhanced expressive power for QCL. Since the required magnetic field strength remains within a practical range, our approach to using the non-integrable system is suitable for large-scale quantum computers. Our results bridge the dynamics of non-integrable systems and the field of quantum machine learning, suggesting the potential for significant interdisciplinary contributions.</p>

            <h2>Efficient witnessing and testing of magic in mixed quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Haug, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a crucial resource for quantum computers which can be distilled from noisy quantum states. However, determining the magic of mixed quantum has been a notoriously difficult task. Here, we provide efficient witnesses of magic based on the stabilizer Rényi entropy which robustly indicate the presence of magic and quantitatively estimate magic monotones. We also design efficient property testing algorithms to reliably distinguish states with high and low magic, assuming the entropy is bounded. We apply our methods to certify the number of noisy T-gates under a wide class of noise models. Additionally, using the IonQ quantum computer, we experimentally verify the magic of noisy random quantum circuits. Surprisingly, we find that magic is highly robust, persisting even under exponentially strong noise. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, revealing that subsystems of many-body quantum states can contain extensive magic despite entanglement. Finally, our work also has direct implications for cryptography and pseudomagic: To mimic high magic states with as little magic as possible, one requires an extensive amount of entropy. This implies that entropy is a necessary resource to hide magic from eavesdroppers. Our work uncovers powerful tools to verify and study the complexity of noisy quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Talha Rahim, Saif Al-Kuwari, Mahmood Irtiza Hussain, Asad Ali</p>
            <p>Quantum resources enable secure quantum sensing (SQS) of remote systems, offering significant advantages in precision and security. However, decoherence in the quantum communication channel and during the evolution of quantum states can erode these advantages. In this work, we first propose a general $N-$particle scheme that achieves Heisenberg-limited (HL) scaling for single-parameter estimation in the presence of an ideal quantum communication channel and encoding scenario. For non-ideal dynamics, we introduce a modified protocol incorporating local quantum optimal control (QOC) operations to address noise in SQS under generalized Pauli dephasing and parallel dephasing noise. We analyze two distinct scenarios: a noiseless communication channel with noisy evolution, and a noisy communication channel with noisy evolution. For the noisy channel, we model the link between the communicating parties as a depolarizing channel. The protocol leverages QOC operations to actively mitigate noise, enhancing the achievable quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the classical Fisher information (CFI) based on the chosen measurement strategy.</p>

Both implementations reduce quantum radiation pressure noise and surpass the standard quantum limit of measuring displacement. We discuss potential applications to gravitational-wave detectors, where our scheme enhances low-frequency sensitivity without requiring modifications to the core optics of a conventional Michelson interferometer (e.g., substrate or coating properties). This approach offers a new path to back-action evasion enabled by quantum entanglement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naphan Benchasattabuse, Michal Hajdušek, Rodney Van Meter</p>
            <p>We propose a purification-enhanced all-photonic quantum repeater scheme based on repeater graph states (RGS) framework that leverages the recently proposed half-RGS building block. This framework addresses a longstanding open question--how to naturally integrate entanglement purification with an all-photonic scheme--by enabling long-distance purification without disrupting the core design. Our framework utilizes optimistic purification performed directly on the half-RGS primitives across long distances without waiting for heralding outcomes. The overhead is modest: the RGS generation slows down proportionally with the number of purification rounds, and each round requires only one additional quantum emitter per half-RGS source. However, since the generation time is negligible compared to the end-to-end communication delay, the total latency remains effectively dominated by communication time, similar to frameworks without purification. Our framework enables flexible purification scheduling along the connection path, making it compatible with memory-based strategies, a rich body of research on purification scheduling and optimization that was previously thought inapplicable to the RGS scheme. Through numerical evaluation, we compare the performance of our framework with purification between memories at end nodes.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensor networks (QSNs) have been widely studied for their potential of precise measurements. While most QSN research has focused on estimating continuous variables, recent studies have explored discrete-variable estimation. Here, we propose a method for high-precision identification of phase plate properties using a photon-based QSN, which is categorized as discrete-variable estimation. We consider an interaction of a single photon with $N$ phase plates. There are some distinct properties of the phase plates, and we aim to identify such properties. Specifically, we investigate two cases: (i) distinguishing between phase plates that impart uniformly random phases in the range $[0, 2\pi]$ and those that impart the same phase, and (ii) distinguishing between phase plates that impart uniformly random phases in $[0, 2\pi]$ and those that impart phases within a narrower range $[- \delta, \delta]$ ($0< \delta \ll 1$). For this distinction, we consider two approaches: one in which a single photon is prepared in a nonlocal state before interacting with the phase plates, and the other in which the single photon remains in a local state. Our results demonstrate that the nonlocal state enables more precise identification when $N$ is large.</p>

            <p>Quantum state estimation plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable creation of entanglement within quantum networks, yet conventional Quantum State Tomography (QST) methods remain resource-intensive and impractical for scaling. To address these limitations, we experimentally validate Distimation, a novel distillation-based protocol designed for efficient Bell-diagonal state estimation. Using IBM Quantum simulators and hardware, we demonstrate that Distimation accurately estimates Bell parameters under simulated and real-world noise conditions, but also demonstrating limitations with operational noise and number of available shots. Additionally, we simulate an asymmetric-fidelity Bell pair scenario via Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) to further validate Distimation under realistic network conditions. Our results establish Distimation as a viable method for scalable, real-time entanglement monitoring in practical quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dogyun Ko, Stanisław Świerczewski, Andrzej Opala, Michał Matuszewski, Amir Rahmani</p>
            <p>We propose a machine learning-based approach enhanced by quantum reservoir computing (QRC) to estimate the zero-time second-order correlation function g2(0). Typically, measuring g2(0) requires single-photon detectors and time-correlated measurements. Machine learning may offer practical solutions by training a model to estimate g2(0) solely from average intensity measurements. In our method, emission from a given quantum source is first processed in QRC. During the inference phase, only intensity measurements are used, which are then passed to a software-based decision tree-based ensemble model. We evaluate this hybrid quantum-classical approach across a variety of quantum optical systems and demonstrate that it provides accurate estimates of g2(0). We further extend our analysis to assess the ability of a trained model to generalize beyond its training distribution, both to the same system under different physical parameters and to fundamentally different quantum sources. While the model may yield reliable estimates within specific regimes, its performance across distinct systems is generally limited.</p>

            <p>Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum algorithm for approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems by reducing instances of linear satisfiability to bounded-distance decoding over superpositions of quantum states. A central challenge in realizing DQI is the design of a decoder that operates coherently on quantum superpositions. In this work, we present a concrete quantum circuit implementation of DQI, with a focus on the decoding subroutine. Our design leverages a reversible Gauss-Jordan elimination circuit for the decoding stage. We analyze the circuit's depth and gate complexity and validate its performance through simulations on systems with up to 30 qubits. These results establish a concrete foundation for scalable implementations of DQI and open the door to future algorithmic refinements and hardware-level realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. V. Baeva, A. S. Losev, I. V. Sokolov</p>
            <p>Squeezed Schrödinger cat states are a valuable resource for quantum error correction and quantum computing. In this paper, we investigate the gate for generating such states in the optical regime. Our scheme is based on the entanglement between an arbitrary (in general) signal and a resource non-Gaussian light fields on an asymmetric beamsplitter, followed by homodyne measurement. The resource field is preconditioned in the cubic phase state. In contrast to the previously considered gates that use the same resource state and QND entangling operation, the beamsplitter-based scheme offers a straightforward possibility for obtaining squeezed Schrödinger cat states with the desired degree of squeezing. Along with the exact description of the gate, we perform here the semiclassical analysis of the gate operation we have introduced previously. This allows us to demonstrate clearly the principle of gate operation and to reveal in a simple and visual form the significant statistical properties of the output state, such as the squeezing ratio and the specific deformations of the output cat state components. Comparative analysis of the gate efficiency is presented for different resource states, that is, the cubic phase state and the Fock state. The gate parameters that ensure the generation of squeezed Schrödinger cat states with a needed fidelity and probability are evaluated.</p>

However, while there is now huge activity and investment in the field, there are a number of challenges that must be overcome before the technology can be fully realised. Of primary concern is the development of the classical technology required to interface with quantum systems, as we push towards a new era of high-performance, large-scale quantum computing. In this review, we briefly discuss some of the main challenges facing the development of universally useful quantum computers and the different architectures being investigated. We are primarily concerned with cryogenic quantum systems. These systems are among the most mature quantum computing architectures to date, and are garnering a lot of both industrial and academic attention. We present and analyse the leading methods of interfacing with quantum processors, both now and for the next generation of larger, multi-qubit systems. Recent advancements in control cryoelectronics, both semiconducting and superconducting, are covered, while a view towards newer methods such as optical and wireless qubit interfaces are also presented.</p>

Motivated by Hoeffding's approach, which estimates the empirical distribution and uses it to construct the test statistic, we employ quantum state tomography to reconstruct the unknown state prior to forming the test statistic. Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state.</p>

            <p>We revisit Hawking's black hole radiation derivation, including the quantum state of the initial matter forming the black hole. We investigate how non-vacuum initial quantum states, at the past of a black hole geometry, influence the black hole radiation observed at future null infinity $( \mathcal{I}^+)$. We further classify which of the initial state excitations are distinguishable from one another through measurements on the black hole radiation state. We use Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) to provide a clear physical interpretation of the results, in terms of localised operations. We then take a concrete example of a black hole made of one large collapsing excitation of mass $M$ and compare it to a same-mass black hole formed due to the collapse of two smaller excitations, of mass $M/2$ each. We find using our formalism that the two cases yield different radiation states and can in principle be distinguished. Our results provide a mechanism for partial information recovery in evaporating black holes, classify what information is recoverable through stimulated emission, and a concrete understanding of the classification based on the AQFT localisation.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</p>

We show that Simon's entanglement criterion for the bipartite Gaussian state can be reformulated in terms of commutators between the canonical operators of the detector mode B and the partner mode P of the detector mode A. Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. According to analyses based on moving mirror models, Hawking radiation originates from the Milne modes at past null infinity, that reflect off at the mirror and ultimately transform into real particle modes. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between ``real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation.</p>

            <p>The Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function, commonly used for approximating molecular ground states, becomes nonideal in open shell systems due to the inherent multi-configurational nature of the wave function, limiting accuracy in Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE). We propose replacing the HF wave function with a spin- and spatial-symmetry broken wave function, enhancing convergence by adding a spin operator, $S^2$ as a penalty term to the original molecular Hamiltonian. We verify that this approach provides good convergence behavior towards the lowest energy eigenstate using direct matrix exponentiation for Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Numerical simulations were performed on the hydrogen molecule and a square tetrahydrogen cluster using measurement-assisted unitary approximation in QITE. QITE demonstrates faster convergence to the ground state with broken symmetry (BS) compared to HF, particularly after the molecule exhibits a diradical character of 0.56 for hydrogen. Prior to this point, HF remains more effective, suggesting a transition threshold of diradical character for wave function selection. Additionally, the overlap analysis with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CAS-CI) wave function shows that BS has a larger initial overlap than HF in higher-spin, multi-configurational systems like triple bond dissociation in nitrogen molecule. This method provides a pathway for improved energy simulations in open shell systems, where wave function accuracy significantly impacts downstream quantum algorithms and practical applications in quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</p>

We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>We investigate $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ($\text{GHZ}_n$) entanglement in monitored random Clifford circuits and uncover a series of novel phase transitions and dynamical features. Random Clifford circuits are well-known for a measurement-induced transition between phases of volume-law and area-law (bipartite) entanglement. We numerically find that the volume-law phase is characterized by, approximately, a constant amount of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement, despite the variations of system size and the rate of measurement. The area-law phase does not harbor such tripartite entanglement. A measurement-induced phase transition is also seen from $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement. Moreover, the amount of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement generally does not change with the partitioning of the system, but abruptly drops to zero when a subsystem has more than half of the qubits, giving rise to a partitioning-induced phase transition. Dynamically, $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement does not grow gradually, as is typical for bipartite entanglement, but instead emerges suddenly through dynamical phase transitions (DPTs). Furthermore, in some situations we observe transient $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement that will suddenly disappear through another DPT. We also studied multipartite $\text{GHZ}_{n\geq 4}$ entanglement and find they emerge exclusively at the measurement-induced criticality, providing new insights into the long-range correlations of critical states.</p>

            <p>Although the superradiant phase transition (SRPT) is prohibited in the paradigmatic quantum Rabi model due to the no-go theorem caused by the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term, we demonstrate two distinct types of SRPTs emerging from the normal phase in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model. A discontinuous phase transition between the two types of superradiant phases also emerges in the presence of a strong $\mathbf{A}^2$ term. Additionally, a rich phase diagram featuring a triple point, which connects first- and second-order phase transitions, is derived analytically and confirmed through numerical diagonalization at large effective system sizes. Finally, distinct critical behavior at the triple point is revealed and contrasted with that of a single continuous SRPT. This work may open a new avenue for observing SRPTs in their intrinsic form without altering the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term, while also offering a practical platform for exploring rich quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Recurrence Criteria for Reducible Homogeneous Open Quantum Walks on the Line</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Newton Loebens</p>
            <p>In this paper, we study the recurrence of homogeneous Open Quantum Walks (HOQWs) induced by finite-dimensional coins $(L,B,R)$. We present three distinct recurrence criteria, each adapted to different types of coins. The first criterion applies to coins whose auxiliary map has a unique invariant state, resulting in the first recurrence criterion for Lazy HOQWs. The second one applies to Lazy HOQWs of dimension 2, where we provide a complete characterization of the recurrence for this low-dimensional case. Finally, we present a general criterion for finite-dimensional coins in the non-lazy case $(B=0)$, which generalizes many of the previously known results. This new criterion holds for irreducible and reducible HOQWs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esther Hänggi, Severin Winkler</p>
            <p>Symmetric private information retrieval is a cryptographic task allowing a user to query a database and obtain exactly one entry without revealing to the owner of the database which element was accessed. The task is a variant of general two-party protocols called one-sided secure function evaluation and is closely related to oblivious transfer. Under the name quantum private queries, quantum protocols have been proposed to solve this problem in a cheat-sensitive way: In such protocols, it is not impossible for dishonest participants to cheat, but they risk detection [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230502 (2008)]. We give an explicit attack against any cheat-sensitive symmetric private information retrieval protocol, showing that any protocol that is secure for the user cannot have non-trivial security guarantees for the owner of the database.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling quantum phase estimation: exploring the impact of multi-photon interference on the quantum Fisher information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Annameng Ma, Agustina G. Magnoni, Miguel A. Larotonda, Laura T. Knoll</p>
            <p>Quantum interference is known to become extinct with distinguishing information, as illustrated by the ubiquitous double-slit experiment or the two-photon HOM effect. In the former case single particle interference is destroyed with which-path information while in the latter bunching interference tails-off as photons become distinguishable. It has been observed that when more than two particles are involved, these interference patterns are in general a non monotonic function of the distinguishability. Here we perform a comprehensive characterization, both theoretically and experimentally, of four-photon interference by analyzing the corresponding correlation functions, contemplating several degrees of distinguishability across different parameters. This study provides all the necessary tools to quantify the impact of multi-photon interference on precision measurements of parameters such as phase, frequency, and time difference. We apply these insights to quantify the precision in the estimation of an interferometric phase in a two-port interferometer using a four-photon state. Our results reveal that, for certain phase values, partially distinguishable multi-photon states can achieve higher Fisher information values compared to the two-photon experiment. These findings highlight the potential of distinguishable multi-photon states for enhanced precision in quantum metrology and related applications.</p>

            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Application of an upsampling algorithm to quantum state preparation of continuous and discrete probability distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. P. Erickson</p>
            <p>Upsampling of time series data is often associated with classical fast Fourier transform analysis, but it also can be employed in the preparation of a quantum state vector. The quantum circuit of preparation derived from functional data sampled in this way exhibits exponential gate depth, like other divide-and-conquer algorithms, but is transformable to an equivalent circuit of polylogarithmic gate depth. In this study, we derive a polylogarthmic upsampling algorithm for construction of a state vector with amplitudes that are square roots of probabilities sampled from a continuous probability distribution having support over the entire real line. As examples, we prepare state vectors associated with Gaussian and Laplace distributions; state vectors for other continuous probability distributions such as Cauchy and Student's t follow in a similar manner. We also extend the algorithm to include preparation of a state vector whose amplitudes are square roots of an arbitrary distribution of discrete probabilities. Our analyses focus on univariate distributions, but can be extended to multivariate forms. The polylogarithmic upsampling algorithm has financial and scientific application.</p>

            <p>We show theoretically that the noise due to laser induced backaction acting on a small nanosphere levitated in a standing-wave trap can be considerably reduced by utilising a suitable reflective boundary. We examine the spherical mirror geometry as a case study of this backaction suppression effect, discussing the theoretical and experimental constraints. We study the effects of laser recoil directly, by analysing optical force fluctuations acting on a dipolar particle trapped at the centre of a spherical mirror. We also compute the corresponding measurement imprecision in an interferometric, shot-noise-limited position measurement, using the formalism of Fisher information flow. Our results show that the standing-wave trapping field is necessary for backaction suppression in three dimensions, and they satisfy the Heisenberg limit of detection.</p>

            <h2>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magali Korolev, Karyn Le Hur</p>
            <p>We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids. This is equivalent to add charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. This reveals from an equilibrium approach the entangled nature of the two counter-propagating fractional charges associated to the same electron in the system. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach also clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ring geometry at zero temperature from a space-time correspondence in 1D. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group. Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, also we show how bipartite fluctuations can detect the presence of a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</p>

            <p>Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown, and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research, and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.</p>

            <h2>Broadband Kinetic-Inductance Parametric Amplifiers with Impedance Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Chiao Hung, Hiroki Kutsuma, Chung Wai Sandbo Chang, Arjan Ferdinand van Loo, Yasunobu Nakamura</p>
            <p>Broadband quantum-limited parametric amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in quantum information science and technology. Impedance-engineered resonator-based PAs and traveling-wave PAs are the primary approaches to overcome the gain-bandwidth constraint. While the former PAs are simpler to fabricate, the target characteristic impedance Z_\text{NR} of the nonlinear resonator has been restricted to be below 10 \Omega, requiring large capacitance. Moreover, these PAs have only been implemented with aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs), hindering their operation at high temperatures or strong magnetic fields. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage impedance-transformer scheme, showcased with a 20-nm-thick, 250-nm-wide high-kinetic-inductance niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN) film. Our scheme enables Z_\text{NR} up to several tens of ohms--a tenfold improvement over conventional designs, achieved through an additional quarter-wavelength transmission line with the characteristic impedance of 180 \Omega. Our kinetic-inductance impedance-engineered parametric amplifiers (KIMPA), featuring a 330-fF shunt capacitor, demonstrate a phase-preserving amplification with a 450-MHz bandwidth at 17-dB gain, and an added noise ranging from 0.5-1.3 quanta near the center frequency of 8.4 GHz. Due to the high critical current of the NbTiN nanowire, the KIMPA also achieves a saturation power of up to -68\pm3 dBm, approximately 30-dB higher than that of JJ-based PAs. This scheme also opens new possibilities for other three-wave-mixing building blocks.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Enhanced Change Detection and Joint Communication-Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Gong, Saikat Guha</p>
            <p>Quick detection of transmittance changes in optical channel is crucial for secure communication. We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using two-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency compared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The change detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative entropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise, suggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore the fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection latency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinícius V. Seco, Alencar J. de Faria</p>
            <p>The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied quantum measurement procedures. Usually, such process involves the coupling of a single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that the relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by observing the probe system. Here, we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings among the signal and probe modes with ancillary modes prepared off-line in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed by homodyne detections and feedforward modulations. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for post-modulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.</p>

            <h2>Magic state distillation without measurements and post-selection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sascha Heußen</p>
            <p>Magic state distillation (MSD) is a quantum algorithm that enables performing logical non-Clifford gates with in principle arbitrarily low noise level. It is herein typically assumed that logical Clifford gates can be executed without noise. Therefore, MSD is a standard subroutine to obtain a fault-tolerant universal set of quantum gate operations on error-corrected logical qubits. Well-known schemes conventionally rely on performing operator measurements and post-selection on the measurement result, which makes distillation protocols non-deterministic in the presence of noise. In this work, we adapt the 15-to-1 MSD protocol such that it deterministically suppresses noise by using a coherent feedback network on the output states without the need to perform individual qubit measurements. These advantages over textbook MSD come at the price of reducing the noise suppression per round from $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$. Our technique can be applied to any MSD protocol with an acceptance rate of 1 in the absence of noise. It may be desirable to use our scheme if the coherent feedback network can be executed faster and more reliably than the measurements and/or if logical clock cycles in the quantum processor should be kept synchronous at all times. Our result broadens the path of potential experimental realizations of MSD in near-term devices and advances the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with practical use.</p>

            <p>Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.</p>

            <p>Counterdiabatic driving emerges as a valuable technique for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, enhancing quantum technology applications. In this context, counterdiabatic quantum computing represents a new paradigm with the potential to achieve quantum advantage for industrial problems. This work investigates the production of quantum coherence in adiabatic evolution accelerated by counterdiabatic driving within the framework of counterdiabatic quantum computing. Specifically, we analyze different orders in the nested commutator expansion for approximated counterdiabatic drivings for three cases: a weighted max-cut problem, a 4-local Hamiltonian, and a non-stoquastic Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that the hierarchy introduced by coherence production correlates with the success probability in the impulse regime. This suggests that protocols increasing coherence during evolution enhance performance in adiabatic evolution driven by counterdiabatic techniques. We show that large quantum coherence also means large energy fluctuation during evolution, which is associated with the speed of evolution, paving the way for designing superior algorithms in counterdiabatic quantum computing.</p>

By incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find non-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model allows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the cavity deviating from $90^\circ$.

            <p>When light and matter interact strongly, the resulting hybrid system inherits properties from both constituents, allowing one to modify material behavior by engineering the surrounding electromagnetic environment. This concept underlies the emerging paradigm of cavity materials engineering, which aims at the control of material properties via tailored vacuum fluctuations of dark photonic environments. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging due to the combined complexity of extended electronic states and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here, we derive an effective, non-perturbative theory for low-dimensional crystals embedded in a Fabry-Pérot resonator, within the long-wavelength limit. Our approach incorporates the multimode and dispersive nature of the cavity field and reduces it to an effective single-mode description by imposing the condition of negligible momentum transfer from light to matter. Importantly, the resulting effective mode is characterized by a finite mode volume-even in the limit of extended cavities-which is directly linked to realistic cavity parameters. This ensures that the light-matter coupling remains finite in bulk systems. By explicitly accounting for the finite reflectivity of cavity mirrors, our theory also avoids double counting the contribution from free-space light-matter coupling. Overall, our results provide a robust and realistic framework for describing cavity-matter interactions at the Hamiltonian level, incorporating the electromagnetic environment beyond the idealized perfect-mirror approximation.</p>

            <h2>Tripartite entanglement and Bell non-locality in loop-induced Higgs boson decays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. A. Morales</p>
            <p>In this article, we study quantum entanglement properties of the three-body $H\to\gamma l\bar{l}$ decays (for $l=e,\mu,\tau$) within the context of the Standard Model augmented with CP-violating interactions in the lepton Yukawa sector. Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.</p>

            <p>We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</p>

The emergent chiral qubits naturally suppress always-on interactions that can not be switched off in weakly coupled qubits, as demonstrated through Liouville-von Neumann dynamics, which reveal phase difference in superposition states that form chiral qubits. To validate this framework, we examine realistic lanthanide complexes with radical-bridged magnetic centers, where spin-orbit coupling and asymmetric exchange facilitate chirality. Our findings establish spin chirality engineering as a promising strategy for mitigating always-on interaction in entangling two chiral qubits in molecular quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>In this article, we solve the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation in the presence of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier and well for spin-one particles. We derive the scattering solution in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1(a, b; c; z)$, the regularized Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2\tilde{F}_1(a, b; c; z)$, and the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$. Our analysis reveals the presence of transmission resonances. To observe these resonances, we calculate and plot the transmission $T$ and reflection $R$ coefficients for various parameters of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Our results are compared with those obtained for the square potential barrier and the cusp potential barrier, which represent limiting cases of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Furthermore, we investigate the bound state solutions, determining the critical turning point $V_{cr}$ to study particle-antiparticle creation and compute the norm $N$. Finally, we also compare our results with those obtained for the square potential well and the cusp potential well, confirming that pair creation occurs in both potential wells.</p>

            <h2>Robust Mixed-State Cluster States and Spurious Topological Entanglement Negativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seunghun Lee, Eun-Gook Moon</p>
            <p>We investigate 1D and 2D cluster states under local decoherence to assess the robustness of their mixed-state subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) order. By exactly computing fidelity correlators via dimensional reduction of effective statistical mechanics models, we pinpoint the critical error rate for strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of strong subsystem symmetry. Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity. This also highlights that topological entanglement negativity, a widely used diagnostic for mixed-state topological order, is generally not invariant under finite-depth quantum channels.</p>

            <p>The density matrix yields probabilistic information about the outcome of measurements on a quantum system, but it does not distinguish between classical randomness in the preparation of the system and entanglement with its environment. Here, we show that retrodiction, employing both prior and posterior knowledge, gives rise to conditional probabilities for measurements on a single system, that can witness if it is part of a larger composite system. The degree of certainty with which one can retrodict the outcomes of multiple measurements on a system can witness both the existence and the quantitative nature of its entanglement with the environment.</p>

            <h2>Injection locking of Rydberg dissipative time crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darmindra Arumugam</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium Rydberg gases exhibit exotic many-body phases stabilized by the interplay of coherent interactions and dissipation. Strong Rydberg interactions drive sustained limit cycle oscillations, whose robustness, long-range temporal order, and spontaneous time-translation symmetry breaking establish a dissipative time crystal (DTC). Collective self-entrainment in driven ensembles leads to global synchronization and a dominant oscillation frequency. Here, injection locking of a Rydberg DTC is demonstrated using a radio-frequency (RF) electric field that gradually pulls the intrinsic oscillation toward the injected frequency. Above a critical threshold, full synchronization occurs, with the locking bandwidth scaling linearly with RF amplitude. This includes synchronization of higher-order harmonics, revealing entrainment of the system nonlinear temporal dynamics. The phenomenon parallels injection locking in classical nonlinear systems, but emerges here in a strongly interacting quantum medium. This approach establishes a new method for stabilizing and controlling quantum temporal order, with applications in precision sensing, quantum metrology, and timekeeping.</p>

            <p>We investigate theoretically the improvement of the entanglement between the indirectly coupled two magnon modes in a magnomechanical system with magnon squeezing. We quantify the degree of entanglement via logarithmic negativity between two magnon modes. We show a significant enhancement of entanglement via magnon squeezing. Additionally, the entanglement of two magnons decreases monotonically under thermal effects. We demonstrate that with an increasing photon tunneling rate, entanglement is robust and resistant to thermal effects. We use purity as a witness to the mixing between the two magnon modes. We show that synchronization and purity are very robust against thermal effects rather than entanglement. We examine the relationship between quantum entanglement, purity, and quantum synchronization in both steady and dynamic states. According to our results, this scheme could be a promising platform for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Kronecker states: a powerful source of multipartite maximally entangled states in quantum information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walther Gonzalez</p>
            <p>In quantum information theory, maximally entangled states, specifically locally maximally entangled (LME) states, are essential for quantum protocols. While many focus on bipartite entanglement, applications such as quantum error correction and multiparty secret sharing rely on multipartite entanglement. These LME states naturally appear in the invariant subspaces of tensor products of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$, called Kronecker subspaces, whose dimensions are the Kronecker coefficients. A Kronecker subspace is a space of multipartite LME states that entangle high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Although these states can be derived from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $S_n$, known methods are inefficient even for small $n$. A quantum-information-based alternative comes from entanglement concentration protocols, where Kronecker subspaces arise in the isotypic decomposition of multiple copies of entangled states. Closed forms have been found for the multiqubit $W$-class states, but not in general. This thesis extends that approach to any multiqubit system. We first propose a graphical construction called W-state Stitching, where multiqubit entangled states are represented as tensor networks built from $W$ states. By analyzing the isotypic decomposition of copies of these graph states, corresponding graph Kronecker states can be constructed. In particular, graph states of generic multiqubit systems can generate any Kronecker subspace. We explicitly construct bases for three- and four-qubit systems and show that the W-stitching technique also serves as a valuable tool for multiqubit entanglement classification. These results may open new directions in multipartite entanglement resource theories, with bipartite and tripartite $W$ states as foundational elements, and asymptotic analysis based on Kronecker states.</p>

            <p>Rare events are essential for understanding the behavior of non-equilibrium and industrial systems. It is of ongoing interest to develop methods for effectively searching for rare events. With the advent of quantum computing and its potential advantages over classical computing for applications like sampling certain probability distributions, the question arises whether quantum computers could also provide an advantage or inspire new methods for sampling the statistics of rare events. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method for studying rare dynamics, and we investigate their benefits over classical approaches based on neural networks. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrate that our QRL agents can learn and generate the rare dynamics of random walks, and we are able to explain this success as well as the different contributing factors to it via the intrinsic Fourier features of the parameterized quantum circuit. Furthermore, we show better learning behavior with fewer parameters compared to classical approaches. This is the first investigation of QRL applied to generating rare events and suggests that QRL is a promising method to study their dynamics and statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiju Cherian John, Christos N. Gagatsos, Boulat A. Bash</p>
            <p>We generalize the quantum CUSUM (QUSUM) algorithm for quickest change-point detection, analyzed in finite dimensions by Fanizza, Hirche, and Calsamiglia (Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 020602, 2023), to infinite-dimensional quantum systems. Our analysis relies on a novel generalization of a result by Hayashi (Hayashi, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34, 3413, 2001) concerning the asymptotics of quantum relative entropy, which we establish for the infinite-dimensional setting. This enables us to prove that the QUSUM strategy retains its asymptotic optimality, characterized by the relationship between the expected detection delay and the average false alarm time for any pair of states with finite relative entropy. Consequently, our findings apply broadly, including continuous-variable systems (e.g., Gaussian states), facilitating the development of optimal change-point detection schemes in quantum optics and other physical platforms, and rendering experimental verification feasible.</p>

We prove theoretically that this technique reaches the ultimate sensitivity in the 3D relative localization of two emitters, already with a number of sampling measurements of 1000 and a bias in the three localization parameters below 1%.

            <p>Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a critical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially-separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We further transfer the W state from the memory qubits to the photonic qubits, and confirm the genuine four-partite entanglement through witness measurements. We then demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way towards realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.</p>

            <h2>Achieving the positivity of the secret key in a BB84 like quantum key distribution protocol</h2>

            <p>Woodhead [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{88}, 012331 (2013)] derived the lower bound of the secret key rate for a Bennett-Brassard (BB84) like quantum key distribution protocol under collective attacks. However, this lower bound does not always assure the generation of the secret key and thus the protocol may have to be aborted sometimes. Thus, we modify the Woodhead's lower bound of the secret key rate in such a way that the secret key is always generated in a BB84 like quantum key distribution protocol. Exploiting the obtained modified lower bound of the secret key rate, we analyze two state dependent quantum cloning machines such as (i) Wootters-Zurek QCM and (ii) Modified Buzek-Hillery QCM constructed by fixing the cloning machine parameters of Buzek Hillery quantum cloning machine (QCM), which may be used by the eavesdropper to extract information from the intercepted state. We, thereafter, show that it is possible for the communicating parties to distill a secret key, even in the presence of an eavesdropper. Moreover, we also discuss the effect of the efficiency of the QCM on the generation of the secret key for a successful key distribution protocol.</p>

            <p>Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), enhances quantum cryptography by mitigating detector-side vulnerabilities. This study analyzes MDI-QKD performance in thermal-loss and phase noise channels, modeled as depolarizing and dephasing channels to capture thermal and phase noise effects. Based on this channel framework, we derive analytical expressions for Bell state measurement probabilities, quantum bit error rates (QBER), and secret key rates (SKR) of MDI-QKD. Our simulations reveal that SKR decreases exponentially with transmission distance, with performance further degraded by increasing thermal noise and phase noise, particularly under high thermal noise conditions. These findings offer insights into enhancing MDI-QKD's noise resilience, supporting secure key generation in practical, noisy environments.</p>

            <p>Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for practical quantum computing, as it protects fragile quantum information from errors by encoding it in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Conventional QEC protocols typically require repeated syndrome measurements, real-time feedback, and the use of multiple physical qubits for encoding. Such implementations pose significant technical complexities, particularly for trapped-ion systems, with high demands on precision and scalability. Here, we realize autonomous QEC with a logical qubit encoded in multiple internal spin states of a single trapped ion, surpassing the break-even point for qubit lifetime. Our approach leverages engineered spin-motion couplings to transfer error-induced entropy into motional modes, which are subsequently dissipated through sympathetic cooling with an ancilla ion, fully eliminating the need for measurement and feedback. By repetitively applying this autonomous QEC protocol under injected low-frequency noise, we extend the logical qubit lifetime to approximately 11.6 ms, substantially outperforming lifetime for both the physical qubit ($\simeq$0.9 ms) and the uncorrected logical qubit ($\simeq$0.8 ms), thereby beating the break-even point with autonomous protection of quantum information without measurement or post-selection. This work presents an efficient approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing that harnesses the intrinsic multi-level structure of trapped ions, providing a distinctive path toward scalable architectures and robust quantum memories with reduced overhead.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) plays a critical role in preventing information loss in quantum systems and provides a framework for reliable quantum computation. Identifying quantum codes with nice code parameters for physically motivated noise models remains an interesting challenge. While past work has primarily focused on qubit codes, here we identify a $[4,1]$ qudit error correcting code tailored to protect against amplitude-damping noise. We show that this four-qudit code satisfies the error correction conditions for all single-qudit and a few two-qudit damping errors up to the leading order in the damping parameter $\gamma$. We devise a protocol to extract syndromes that unambiguously identify this set of errors, leading to a noise-adapted recovery scheme that achieves a fidelity loss of $\mathcal{O}(\gamma^{2})$. For the $d=2$ case, our QEC scheme is identical to the known example of the $4$-qubit code and the associated syndrome-based recovery. We also assess the performance of this code using the Petz recovery map and note some interesting deviations from the qubit case. Finally, we generalize this construction to a family of $[2M+2, M]$ qudit codes that can approximately correct all the single-qudit and a few two-qudit amplitude-damping errors.</p>

We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced Förster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</p>

These cases are experimentally accessible in superconducting circuits, where the Floquet quasienergy spectrum can also be studied as a function of tunable control parameters. Using the classical Hamiltonian of the system, we identify the critical points associated with quantum phase transitions and analyze the emergence of both real and avoided level crossings, examining their influence on the energy spectrum and tunneling dynamics.

            <p>Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile platform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme extends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting quantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as single-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware efficiency.</p>

            <p>In a two-membrane cavity optomechanical setup, two semi-transparent membranes placed within an optical Fabry-Pérot cavity yield a nontrivial dependence of the frequency of a mode of the optical cavity on the membranes' positions, which is due to interference. However, the system dynamics is typically described by a radiation pressure force treatment in which the frequency shift is expanded stopping at first order in the membrane displacements. In this paper, we study the full dynamics of the system obtained by considering the exact nonlinear dependence of the optomechanical interaction between two membranes' vibrational modes and the driven cavity mode. We then compare this dynamics with the standard treatment based on the Hamiltonian linear interaction, and we find the conditions under which the two dynamics may significantly depart from each other. In particular, we see that a parameter regime exists in which the customary first-order treatment provides distinct and incorrect predictions for the synchronization of two self-sustained mechanical limit-cycles, and for Gaussian entanglement of the two membranes in the case of two-tone driving.</p>

This "interferometric Purcell filter" does not require dedicated filter components or impedance mismatch in the feedline, making it suitable for applications such as all-pass readout. We design and fabricate a device with the proposed scheme and demonstrate suppression of resonator-mediated decay that exceeds 2 orders of magnitude over a bandwidth of 400 MHz for a resonator linewidth of 13.8 MHz.</p>

            <h2>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in cavity QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muzamil Shah, Shahid Qamar, Muhammad Waseem</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the manipulation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance, the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits PSHE similar to the CTL system, showing enhanced PSHE due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence PSHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence PSHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning PSHE. The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED. The demonstrated tunability via probe field detuning, control fields, and atomic density paves the way for advanced optical control and enhanced precision in cavity QED devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature Via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imad-Eddine Chorfi, Nacer eddine Belaloui, Abdellah Tounsi, Achour Benslama, Mohamed Taha Rouabah</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <h2>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yevhenii Morozov, Anatoliy Lapchuk</p>
            <p>Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity: A perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anneswa Paul, Upendra Harbola</p>
            <p>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity and formation of polaritonic states have gained interest in the past decades as it has direct applications in many research fields. Different regimes of light-matter coupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is rotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling and near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \leq \lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \leq\lambda/\omega_c\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\lambda/\omega_c\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting has been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic states. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon coupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is not captured by RWA. In fact, RWA breaks down completely to predict the ground state properties as it fails to capture the interaction between the matter and the cavity field.</p>

            <p>Photonic quantum computing offers a promising platform for quantum information processing, benefiting from the long coherence times of photons and their ease of manipulation. This paper presents a scheme for implementing a deterministic phase gate for dual-rail number encoded photonic qubits, leveraging a standard 1D waveguide coupled to an array of two-level emitters (TLE). Using a transfer matrix approach, we develop a protocol for deterministic phase gate operation, demonstrating its robustness against non-waveguide mode coupling and disorder. Finally, we relax the idealized assumption of monochromatic light, considering finite-bandwidth pulses. Despite these realistic considerations, our results indicate high fidelity for the proposed phase gate protocol. Finally we will discuss two qubit operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shao-Xiong Wu, Xue-Chen Gao, Huan-Huan Cheng, Cheng-Hua Bai</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to generate and manipulate nonreciprocal photon blockade effect in an asymmetrical Fabry-Pérot cavity, which consists of a single two-level atom and a second-order nonlinear medium. By utilizing the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of cavity and applying a parametric amplification pumping laser to the nonlinear medium, we can realize direction-dependent single-photon and two-photon blockade effects. For nonreciprocal single-photon blockade, our proposal is robust across a wide range of parameters, such as the cavity or atomic detuning, coupling strength, and atomic decay. Within similar parameter ranges, nonreciprocal two-photon blockade can be achieved and modulated by finely adjusting the parametric amplification pumping. Our project offers a feasible access to generating high-quality and tunable nonreciprocal single/two-photon source and paves a new avenue for investigating the nonreciprocity of photon quantum statistical properties.</p>

            <p>Radiation-pressure interactions between harmonic oscillators have enabled exquisite measurement precision and control, made possible by using strong sideband drives, enhancing the coupling rate while also linearizing the interaction. In this letter, we demonstrate a strong intrinsic longitudinal coupling, a circuit quantum electrodynamics analogue of the radiation-pressure interaction, between a transmon qubit and a linear microwave resonator. A red-detuned sideband drive results in an on-demand Jaynes-Cummings interaction with a high on-off ratio. We measure a longitudinal coupling rate an order of magnitude larger than all decay rates, placing the device in the strong coupling regime. The intrinsic longitudinal interaction demonstrated here will enable the development of high-connectivity quantum information processing hardware and the exploration of the gravitational decoherence of quantum objects.</p>

In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are among the most promising solid-state qubit candidates, owing to their exceptionally long spin coherence times, efficient spin-photon coupling, room-temperature operation, and steadily advancing fabrication and integration techniques. Despite significant progress in the field, atomic-scale characterization and control of individual NV centers have remained elusive. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing a conductive graphene capping layer to enable direct imaging and manipulation of $NV^{-}$ defects via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By investigating over 40 individual $NV^{-}$ centers, we identify their spectroscopic signatures and spatial configurations. Our dI/dV conductance spectra reveal the ground state approximately 300 meV below the Fermi level. Additionally, density-of-states mapping uncovers a two-lobed wavefunction aligned along the [111] crystallographic direction. Remarkably, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate the charge state of the NV centers from $NV^{-}$ to $NV^{0}$ through STM tip-induced gating. This work represents a significant advancement in the atomic-scale understanding and engineering of NV centers, paving the way for future quantum device development.</p>

            <h2>Theory of quantum optics and optical coherence in high harmonic generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Stammer, Javier Rivera-Dean, Maciej Lewenstein</p>
            <p>Optical coherence encodes information about the correlations of the electromagnetic field. In combination with quantum optical approaches, it allows for the study of the correlations between photons. Since the pioneering papers of Glauber, studies of optical coherence have facilitated many fundamental insights into non-classical signatures of light emission processes, with wide applicability in modern quantum technologies. However, when it comes to the photon up-conversion process of high-order harmonic generation the description has focused on semi-classical methods for decades. In this work, we overcome this limitation and establish a quantum optical theory of field correlations for the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). In effect, we introduce the notion of optical coherence at the intersection of quantum optics and strong laser-driven processes, and obtain the harmonic field correlation functions. In particular, we focus on the first and second order field correlation, which allow to understand the origin of the classical properties of the HHG spectrum, and its departure into the quantum regime. Further, we develop the theory for two-time intensity correlation functions of the harmonic field, and demonstrate the onset of anti-bunching signatures in HHG. We study the correlation functions in the regime of a single, few and many emitters in atomic HHG, showing the transition from quantum to classical signatures in the correlations. Since the theory is generic, it can be extended to multi-time correlation functions of any order, and allows to consider the interaction of light with arbitrary material systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum repeaters enhanced by vacuum beam guides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Gan, Mohadeseh Azar, Nitish Kumar Chandra, Xin Jin, Jinglei Cheng, Kaushik P. Seshadreesan, Junyu Liu</p>
            <p>The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities.</p>

            <p>Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when some loss mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.</p>

For a two-qubit quantum probe used to estimate the coupling constant appearing in a simple interaction Hamiltonian, we show that at certain times CoE = -QFI; these times can be associated with the concurrence, viewed as a function of the coupling parameter, being a maximum. We examine the time evolution of the concurrence of the eigenstates of the symmetric logarithmic derivative and show that, for both initially separable and initially entangled states, simple product measurements suffice to saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound when CoE = -QFI, while otherwise, in general, entangled measurements are required giving an operational significance to the points in time when CoE = -QFI.</p>

Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states without requiring subwavelength spatial resolution. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moiré excitons.</p>

For instance, a high-speed, low-loss optical switch is crucial for scaling quantum photonic systems that rely on measurement-based feed-forward approaches. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical switching of heralded photon-number states using the optical Kerr effect in a single-mode fiber. A local birefringence is created by a high-intensity pump pulse at a center wavelength of 1030nm that temporally overlaps with the 1550nm photon-number states in the fiber. By taking advantage of the dispersion profile of commercially available single-mode fibers, we achieve all-optical switching of photon-number states, with up to 6 photons, with a switching resolution of 2.3ps. A switching efficiency of >99% is reached with a signal-to-noise ratio of 32,000.</p>

This practically inevitable scenario leads to a tripartite quantum system of matter, and light -- detected and lost. Evaluating fundamental information theoretic quantities such as the quantum Fisher information of only the detected light was heretofore impossible. We succeed by expressing the final quantum state of the detected light as a matrix product operator. We apply our method to resonance fluorescence and pulsed spectroscopy. For both, we quantify the sub-optimality of continuous homodyning and photo-counting measurements in parameter estimation. For the latter, we find that single-photon Fock state pulses allow higher precision per photon than pulses of coherent states. Our method should be valuable in studies of quantum light-matter interactions, quantum light spectroscopy, quantum stochastic thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Miano, Loris Maria Cangemi, Carlo Forestiere</p>
            <p>This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter can be described by means of two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each described by its own spectral density. Therefore, for initial thermal states of the reservoirs having different temperatures, the common approach based on the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object cannot be employed. We study the interaction of a quantum emitter with these two reservoirs introducing a temperature-dependent effective spectral density of the electromagnetic environment, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Rovny, Shimon Kolkowitz, Nathalie P. de Leon</p>
            <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using coherent, single qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators, or using entangled states to improve measurement sensitivity. Here, we describe protocols to use optically unresolved NV center pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise, enabling covariance magnetometry at nanometer length scales. For NV centers that are optically unresolved but have spectrally resolved spin transitions, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations by alternating the relative spin orientations of the two NV centers. For NV centers that are both optically and spectrally unresolved, we leverage the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus that is strongly coupled to one of the NV centers, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable a similar phase-cycling protocol. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole-dipole coupling between two NV centers, and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centers. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV center spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in a dramatic sensitivity improvement. Finally, we demonstrate methods for the detection of high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centers.</p>

In this work, we construct a set of symmetrized M-excitation dark states and derive analytic expressions for their time-evolution projections. This framework captures the essential dynamics of excitation transport and storage while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to full quantum simulations. Our analysis reveals a fundamental bound on energy redistribution governed by the structure of dark states and collective dissipation, and discovers that optimal excitation transfer between emitter ensembles converges toward an initial pumped fraction of $N_\text{p}/N \approx 0.55$ for large system sizes. We further examine the robustness of this mechanism under realistic imperfections, including positional disorder, nonradiative decay, and dephasing. These results highlight the role of many-body dark states in enabling efficient and controllable energy transfer, offering new insights into dissipative many-body dynamics in integrated quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Dressed Interference in Giant Superatoms: Entanglement Generation and Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Du, Xin Wang, Anton Frisk Kockum, Janine Splettstoesser</p>
            <p>We introduce the concept of giant superatoms (GSAs), where two or more interacting atoms are nonlocally coupled to a waveguide through one of them, and explore their unconventional quantum dynamics. For braided GSAs, this setup enables decoherence-free transfer and swapping of their internal entangled states. For separate GSAs, engineering coupling phases leads to state-dependent chiral emission, which enables selective, directional quantum information transfer. This mechanism further facilitates remote generation of W-class entangled states. Our results thereby open exciting possibilities for quantum networks and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Observation of quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan-Wilke Henke, Hao Jeng, Murat Sivis, Claus Ropers</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is central to both the foundations of quantum mechanics and the development of new technologies in information processing, communication, and sensing. Entanglement has been realised in a variety of physical systems, spanning atoms, ions, photons, collective excitations, and hybrid combinations of particles. Remarkably, however, photons and free electrons -- the quanta of light and their most elementary sources -- have never been observed in an entangled state. Here, we demonstrate quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons. We show that entanglement is produced when an electron, prepared in a superposition of two beams, passes a nanostructure and generates transition radiation in a polarisation state tied to the electron path. By implementing quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the full density matrix of the electron-photon pair, and show that the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is violated by more than 7 standard deviations. Based on this foundational element of emerging free-electron quantum optics, we anticipate manifold developments in enhanced electron imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. More broadly, the ability to generate and measure entanglement opens electron microscopy to previously inaccessible quantum observables and correlations in solids and nanostructures.</p>

            <p>Entanglement, a key resource of emerging quantum technologies, describes correlations between particles that defy classical physics. It has been studied extensively on various platforms, but has remained elusive in electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopes are well-established tools for materials characterisation with unparalleled spatial resolution. They provide control over the preparation and detection of high energy electrons, with largely unexploited potential in the study of many-body quantum correlations. Here, we demonstrate entanglement in electron-photon pairs generated via cathodoluminescence in a transmission electron microscope. Employing coincidence imaging techniques adapted from photonic quantum optics, we reconstruct both near- and far-field ``ghost'' images of periodic transmission masks. By measuring spatial and momentum correlations, we show a violation of the classical uncertainty bound: $\Delta x_-^2 \Delta k_+^2 = 0.502 \pm 0.047<1$. Hence, we demonstrate entanglement in position and momentum -- the continuous variables at the base of most imaging methods, bridging the fields of electron microscopy and quantum optics. Our work paves the way for exploring quantum correlations in free-electron systems and their application to quantum-enhanced imaging techniques on the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5 \times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$ $^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ji-Chong Yang, Shuai Zhang, Chong-Xing Yue</p>
            <p>Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small. Consequently, future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as precision tests advance, rare processes with many final-state particles require consideration which demand the analysis of a vast number of observables. The high luminosity produces a large amount of experimental data spanning a large observable space, posing a significant data-processing challenge. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose quantum searching neighbor~(QSN) and variational QSN~(VQSN) algorithms to search for NP. The QSN is a classification algorithm. The VQSN introduces variation to the QSN to process classical data. As applications, we apply the (V)QSN in the phenomenological study of the NP at the Large Hadron Collider and muon colliders. The results indicate that the VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M'bark Amghar, Noura Chabar, Mohamed Amazioug, Amjad Sohail Shah</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to investigate the magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) phenomenon, Fano resonances, and slow/fast light effects in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. The magnomechanical system consists of two cavities: the principal cavity contains two ferromagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres, and the auxiliary cavity contains an atomic assembly. These two cavities are connected via photon tunneling, with the principal cavity being driven by two electromagnetic fields. The photon-magnon and phonon-magnon couplings are responsible for the magnon-induced transparency (MIT) and MMIT observed in the probe output spectrum. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of tunneling coupling, atom-photon coupling, and the magnetic field on the absorption, dispersion, and transmission spectra. We provide an explanation of the mechanism behind the Fano resonance phenomenon. Additionally, we address the phenomenon of slow and light propagation. Moreover, we demonstrate that group delay of the probe field can be improved by increasing photon tunneling strength. We also show that the slow light profile is decreased by adjusting the atom-photon coupling strength. This model is experimentally feasible. We hope these findings have the potential to be applied to the processing of quantum information and communication.</p>

            <h2>Post-Variational Ground State Estimation via QPE-Based Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nora Bauer, George Siopsis</p>
            <p>Quantum phase estimation (QPE) plays a pivotal role in many quantum algorithms, offering provable speedups in applications such as Shor's factoring algorithm. While fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for combinatorial and Hamiltonian optimization often integrate QPE with variational protocols-like the quantum approximate optimization Ansatz or variational quantum eigensolver-these approaches typically rely on heuristic techniques requiring parameter optimization. In this work, we present the QPE-based quantum imaginary time evolution (QPE-QITE) algorithm, designed for post-variational ground state estimation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Unlike variational methods, QPE-QITE employs additional ancillae to project the quantum register into low-energy eigenstates, eliminating the need for parameter optimization. We demonstrate the capabilities of QPE-QITE by applying it to the low-autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) problem, which is a higher order optimization problem that has been studied in the context of quantum scaling advantage. Scaling estimates for magic state requirements are provided to assess the feasibility of addressing these problems on near-term fault-tolerant devices, establishing a benchmark for quantum advantage. Moreover, we discuss potential implementations of QPE-QITE on existing quantum hardware as a precursor to fault tolerance.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Authentication Protocols for Advanced Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suchetana Goswami, Mina Doosti, Elham Kashefi</p>
            <p>Authentication is a fundamental building block of secure quantum networks, essential for quantum cryptographic protocols and often debated as a key limitation of quantum key distribution (QKD) in security standards. Most quantum-safe authentication schemes rely on small pre-shared keys or post-quantum computational assumptions. In this work, we introduce a new authentication approach that combines hardware assumptions, particularly Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), along with fundamental quantum properties of non-local states, such as local indistinguishability, to achieve provable security in entanglement-based protocols. We propose two protocols for different scenarios in entanglement-enabled quantum networks. The first protocol, referred to as the offline protocol, requires pre-distributed entangled states but no quantum communication during the authentication phase. It enables a server to authenticate clients at any time with only minimal classical communication. The second, an online protocol, requires quantum communication but only necessitates entangled state generation on the prover side. For this, we introduce a novel hardware module, the Hybrid Entangled PUF (HEPUF). Both protocols use weakly secure, off-the-shelf classical PUFs as their hardware module, yet we prove that quantum properties such as local indistinguishability enable exponential security for authentication, even in a single round. We provide full security analysis for both protocols and establish them as the first entanglement-based extension of hardware-based quantum authentication. These protocols are suitable for implementation across various platforms, particularly photonics-based ones, and offer a practical and flexible solution to the long-standing challenge of authentication in quantum communication networks.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Error Correction for Entanglement Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijie Cheng, Narayanan Rengaswamy</p>
            <p>Quantum network applications impose a variety of requirements on entanglement resources in terms of rate, fidelity, latency, and more. The repeaters in the quantum network must combine good methods for entanglement generation, effective entanglement distillation, and smart routing protocols to satisfy these application requirements. In this work, we focus on quantum error correction-based entanglement distillation in a linear chain of quantum repeaters. While conventional approaches reuse the same distillation scheme over multiple hop lengths after entanglement swaps, we propose a novel adaptive error correction scheme that boosts end-to-end metrics. Specifically, depending on the network operation point, we adapt the code used in distillation over successive rounds to monotonically increase the rate while also improving fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using three codes: [[9,1,3]], [[9,2,3]], [[9,3,3]]. We compare the performance of four different protocols that combine the codes in different ways, where we define a new performance metric, efficiency, that incorporates both overall rate and fidelity. While we highlight our innovation under minimal assumptions on noise, the method can be easily generalized to realistic network settings. By combining our approach with good entanglement generation methods and smart routing protocols, we can achieve application requirements in a systematic, resource-efficient, way.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulations of nuclear resonances with variational methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutosh Singh, Pooja Siwach, P. Arumugam</p>
            <p>The many-body nature of nuclear physics problems poses significant computational challenges. These challenges become even more pronounced when studying the resonance states of nuclear systems, which are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Quantum computing, particularly for quantum many-body systems, offers a promising alternative, especially within the constraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work aims to simulate nuclear resonances using quantum algorithms by developing a variational framework compatible with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and implementing it fully on a quantum simulator. We employ the complex scaling technique to extract resonance positions classically and adapt it for quantum simulations using a two-step algorithm. First, we transform the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost function within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory calculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy plane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code (GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach using a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully reproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the method to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the resonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can be implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input beyond the Hamiltonian. The results establish a scalable and efficient quantum framework for simulating resonance phenomena in nuclear systems. This work represents a significant step toward quantum simulations of open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Hardware Co-Designed Optimal Control for Programmable Atomic Quantum Processors via Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Ding, Dirk Englund</p>
            <p>Developing scalable, fault-tolerant atomic quantum processors requires precise control over large arrays of optical beams. This remains a major challenge due to inherent imperfections in classical control hardware, such as inter-channel crosstalk and beam leakage. In this work, we introduce a hardware co-designed intelligent quantum control framework to address these limitations. We construct a mathematical model of the photonic control hardware, integrate it into the quantum optimal control (QOC) framework, and apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover optimal control strategies. We demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, high-fidelity parallel single-qubit gate operations under realistic control conditions, where each atom is individually addressed by an optical beam. Specifically, we implement and benchmark three optimization strategies: a classical hybrid Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution-Adam (SADE-Adam) optimizer, a conventional RL approach based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and a novel end-to-end differentiable RL method. Using SADE-Adam as a baseline, we find that while PPO performance degrades as system complexity increases, the end-to-end differentiable RL consistently achieves gate fidelities above 99.9$\%$, exhibits faster convergence, and maintains robustness under varied channel crosstalk strength and randomized dynamic control imperfections.</p>

            <p>A fundamental problem in quantum information processing is the discrimination among a set of orthogonal quantum states of a composite system under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Corresponding to the LOCC indistinguishable sets of four ququad-ququad orthogonal maximally entangled states (MESs) constructed by Yu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 020506 (2012)], the maximum commutative sets (MCSs) were introduced as detectors for the local distinguishability of the set of generalized Bell states (GBSs), for which the detectors are sufficient to determine the LOCC distinguishability. In this work, we show how to determine all the detectors for a given GBS set. We construct also several 4-GBS sets without detectors, most of which are one-way LOCC indistinguishable and only one is one-way LOCC distinguishable, indicating that the detectors are not necessary for LOCC distinguishability. Furthermore, we show that for 4-GBS sets in quantum system $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$, the detectors are almost necessary for one-way LOCC distinguishability, except for one set in the sense of local unitary equivalence. The problem of one-way LOCC discrimination of 4-GBS sets in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$ is completely resolved.</p>

            <h2>Probing the Abyss of the Quantum Vacuum: A Quest for Fluctuation-Free Domains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun-Hyun Youn</p>
            <p>The modification of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations by boundary conditions is a fundamental prediction of quantum electrodynamics (QED). However, direct experimental verification in the optical regime is hindered by the need for sub-wavelength spatial resolution. Here, we present a novel approach to indirectly probe the spatial distribution of vacuum fluctuations by leveraging radio-frequency (RF) measurements of thermal noise. At RF frequencies, thermal noise, which occupies the same electromagnetic modes as vacuum fluctuations and is similarly shaped by boundary conditions, dominates the single-photon energy. By precisely characterizing the spatial distribution of thermal noise near a conducting boundary, we infer the corresponding modification of vacuum modes and, consequently, the vacuum fluctuations themselves. Our experimental setup, employing coaxial cables and RF splitters to mimic optical mirrors and beam splitters, enables controlled manipulation of boundary conditions and precise thermal noise measurements. We observe a reduction in thermal noise near the conducting boundary, providing indirect evidence for the theoretically predicted suppression of vacuum fluctuations. This work establishes a new experimental framework for investigating QED effects in constrained environments, with potential implications for quantum-limited precision measurements, such as gravitational wave detection and intensity-stabilized light sources. This RF approach circumvents the limitations of optical techniques and opens new avenues for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Gaussian states in quantum field theory: Exact representations of relative phase in superpositions of Gaussian states</h2>

            <p>Gaussian quantum mechanics is a powerful tool regularly used in quantum optics to model linear and quadratic Hamiltonians efficiently. Recent interest in qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge, namely, how to fully manipulate superpositions of Gaussian states. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. Specifically, we evaluate the phase necessary to equate the unitary representation of a zero-mean Gaussian state with its Fock representation. This allows for the coherent manipulation of superpositions of Gaussian states, especially the evaluation of expectation values from these superposed states. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol using quadratic detectors in a regime that has previously been impossible to solve. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime.</p>

The number of product states superposed to a given entangled state which result in a separable state is investigated in detail. Furthermore, the minimal Schmidt ranks of the second order are also introduced to identify the unconditional robustness of an entangled state for tripartite inseparability.</p>

            <p>The development of prototype quantum information processors has progressed to a stage where small instances of logical qubit systems perform better than the best of their physical constituents. Advancing towards fault-tolerant quantum computing will require an understanding of the underlying error mechanisms in logical primitives as they relate to the performance of quantum error correction. In this work we demonstrate the novel capability to characterize the physical error properties relevant to fault-tolerant operations via cycle error reconstruction. We illustrate this diagnostic capability for a transversal CNOT, a prototypical component of quantum logical operations, in a 16-qubit register of a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our error characterization technique offers three key capabilities: (i) identifying context-dependent physical layer errors, enabling their mitigation; (ii) contextualizing component gates in the environment of logical operators, validating the performance differences in terms of characterized component-level physics, and (iii) providing a scalable method for predicting quantum error correction performance using pertinent error terms, differentiating correctable versus uncorrectable physical layer errors. The methods with which our results are obtained have scalable resource requirements that can be extended with moderate overhead to capture overall logical performance in increasingly large and complex systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Roy, Shamik Gupta, Giovanna Morigi</p>
            <p>Quantum resetting protocols can speed up the time in which a quantum walker reaches a target site on a lattice. In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our predictions can be verified in existing experimental setups.</p>

            <p>Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep connections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in open quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system size. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of scrambling transition, discovered using one particular definition, appears in operator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend previous studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the scramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in quantum error correction (QEC) across hardware platforms have demonstrated operation near and beyond the fault-tolerance threshold, yet achieving exponential suppression of logical errors through code scaling remains a critical challenge. Erasure qubits, which enable hardware-level detection of dominant error types, offer a promising path toward resource-efficient QEC by exploiting error bias. Single erasure qubits with dual-rail encoding in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high coherence and low single-qubit gate errors with mid-circuit erasure detection, but the generation of multi-qubit entanglement--a fundamental requirement for quantum computation and error correction--has remained an outstanding milestone. Here, we demonstrate a superconducting processor integrating four dual-rail erasure qubits that achieves the logical multi-qubit entanglement with error-biased protection. Each dual-rail qubit, encoded in pairs of tunable transmons, preserves millisecond-scale coherence times and single-qubit gate errors at the level of $10^{-5}$. By engineering tunable couplings between logical qubits, we generate high-fidelity entangled states resilient to physical qubit noise, including logical Bell states (98.8% fidelity) and a three-logical-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state (93.5% fidelity). A universal gate set is realized through a calibrated logical controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate with 96.2% process fidelity, enabled by coupler-activated $XX$ interactions in the protected logical subspace. This work advances dual-rail architectures beyond single-qubit demonstrations, providing a blueprint for concatenated quantum error correction with erasure qubits.</p>

            <p>The quantum interference between a coherent state and a single photon is an important tool in continuous variable optical quantum technologies to characterize and engineer non-Gaussian quantum states. Semiconductor quantum dots, which have recently emerged as a key platform for efficient single-photon generation, could become interesting assets in this context. An essential parameter for interfering single photons and classical fields is the mean wavepacket overlap between both fields. Here, we report on two homodyne photon-correlation techniques enabling the precise measurement of the overlap between a single photon generated by a quantum dot-cavity device and pulsed laser light. The different statistics of interfering fields lead to specific signatures of the quantum interference on the photon correlations at the output of the interfering beam splitter. We compare the behavior of maximized overlap, measuring either the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility between both outputs or the photon bunching at a single output. Through careful tailoring of the laser light in various degrees of freedom, we maximize the overlap to $76\,\%$, with limitations primarily due to mismatched spectral and temporal profiles and low-frequency charge noise in the single-photon source.</p>

            <h2>Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution via correlation measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungbae Yoon, Keyuan Zhong, Guoqing Wang, Boning Li, Donghun Lee, Paola Cappellaro</p>
            <p>Achieving high-frequency spectral resolution with quantum sensors, while crucial in fields ranging from physical to biological sciences, is challenging due to their finite coherence time. Here, we introduce a novel protocol that achieves this goal by measuring phase correlations of AC magnetic fields using ensembles of NV centers. Our method extends the sensing dynamic range to frequencies higher than the system's Rabi frequency while achieving arbitrary frequency resolution, limited only by the target field coherence time. Moreover, our approach operates more robustly with respect to the magnetic field's amplitude. Thanks to this robustness, our protocol allows the application of more $\pi$-pulses in pulse sequences such as CPMG, enabling the decoupling of a broader range of frequency noise. The higher harmonics generated in this process continue to act as a part of the signal, ultimately improving the frequency resolution. This method paves the way for achieving arbitrary frequency resolution with improved performances, making it highly versatile for quantum sensing applications across diverse scientific fields.</p>

            <p>Photoisomerization, a photochemical process underlying many biological mechanisms, has been modeled recently within the quantum resource theory of thermodynamics. This approach has emerged as a promising tool for studying fundamental limitations to nanoscale processes independently of the microscopic details governing their dynamics. On the other hand, correlations between physical systems have been shown to play a crucial role in quantum thermodynamics by lowering the work cost of certain operations. Here, we explore quantitatively how correlations between multiple photoswitches can enhance the efficiency of photoisomerization beyond that attainable for single molecules. Furthermore, our analysis provides insights into the interplay between quantum and classical correlations in these transformations.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-Coupled Hole-Spin Qubits in High-Purity Germanium: Design and Modeling of a Scalable Architecture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D.-M. Mei, S. A. Panamaldeniya, K. Dong, S. Bhattarai, N. Budhathoki, A. Warren</p>
            <p>We present a design and modeling of a scalable quantum processor architecture utilizing hole-spin qubits defined in gate-controlled germanium (Ge) quantum dots, where coherent spin-phonon coupling is predicted to facilitate qubit manipulation and long-range interactions. The architecture exploits the strong, electrically tunable spin-orbit interactions intrinsic to hole states in Ge, integrated with high-quality phononic crystal cavities (PnCCs) to enable fully electrical qubit control and phonon-mediated coupling. Employing a streamlined simulation framework built upon multiband \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}\) modeling and finite-element methods, we quantify key performance metrics, including electrically tunable \( g \)-factors ranging from \(1.3\) to \(2.0\), spin-phonon coupling strengths up to \(6.3\,\mathrm{MHz}\), phononic cavity quality factors exceeding \(10^4\), and phonon-mediated spin relaxation times (\(T_1\)) reaching milliseconds. The proposed architecture concurrently achieves extended spin coherence and rapid gate operations through strategic electric field modulation and engineered phononic bandgap environments. Furthermore, isotopically enriched high-purity Ge crystals grown in-house at the University of South Dakota, significantly enhance device coherence by minimizing disorder and hyperfine interactions. This integrated approach, merging advanced materials engineering, precise spin-orbit coupling, and phononic cavity design, establishes a promising CMOS-compatible pathway toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Hardness of observing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaozhou Feng, Zihan Cheng, Matteo Ippoliti</p>
            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the cornerstone of our understanding of quantum phases of matter. Recent works have generalized this concept to the domain of mixed states in open quantum systems, where symmetries can be realized in two distinct ways dubbed strong and weak. Novel intrinsically mixed phases of quantum matter can then be defined by the spontaneous breaking of strong symmetry down to weak symmetry. However, proposed order parameters for strong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to require exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it possible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer this question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ symmetries. We construct ensembles of pseudorandom mixed states that do not break the strong symmetry, yet are computationally indistinguishable from states that do. This rules out the existence of efficient state-agnostic protocols to detect strong-to-weak SSB.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian singularities associated with the coalescence of individual eigenvectors accompanied by the degeneracy of their complex energies. Here, we report the discovery of a generalization to the concept of EP called exceptional deficiency (ED), which features the complete coalescence of two eigenspaces with identical but arbitrarily large dimensions and the coincidence of entire spectral continua. The characteristics of the ED are studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED can induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE, resulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions of the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and propagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed using active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new frontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing challenges in related applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lars Kamin, John Burniston, Ernest Y.-Z. Tan</p>
            <p>We develop a flexible and robust framework for finite-size security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols under coherent attacks, applicable to both fixed- and variable-length protocols. Our approach achieves high finite-size key rates across a broad class of protocols while imposing minimal requirements. In particular, it eliminates the need for restrictive conditions such as limited repetition rates or the implementation of virtual tomography procedures. To achieve this goal, we introduce new numerical techniques for the evaluation of sandwiched conditional Rényi entropies. In doing so, we also find an alternative formulation of the "QKD cone" studied in previous work. We illustrate the versatility of our framework by applying it to several practically relevant protocols, including decoy-state protocols. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to accommodate realistic device imperfections, such as independent intensity and phase imperfections. Overall, our framework provides both greater scope of applicability and better key rates than existing techniques, especially for small block sizes, hence offering a scalable path toward secure quantum communication under realistic conditions</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arda Gulucu, Emre Ozan Polat</p>
            <p>Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</p>

            <p>Fibre Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) are used in various studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and quantum technologies due to the cavity's small mode volume and compact integration with optical fibres. We develop a novel $\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by $\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 $\mu$m to 700 $\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\mu$m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser machined fibre end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to demonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hing-Tong Cho, Bei-Lok Hu</p>
            <p>A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented.</p>

            <h2>Unified Multipole Bott Indices for Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Different Orders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wuping Yang, H. Huang</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive phenomenon known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, where an extensive number of eigenstates become localized at the boundaries of a lattice with open boundaries. While the spectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions is a well-established topological indicator for predicting the skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, a suitable topological invariant to diagnose higher-order skin effects remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose a unified non-Hermitian multipole characterization framework that generalizes the concept of spectral winding to higher-order skin effects. Specifically, we develop a set of non-Hermitian multipole Bott indices capable of diagnosing skin effects of different orders. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of both first- and higher-order skin effects in non-Hermitian systems, offering new perspectives for exploring topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly decaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal compressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by the Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After linearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the impurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and sound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the fluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly provided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton with Schrödinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the impurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with the medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results are relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi or Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases.</p>

            <p>Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.</p>

A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</p>

            <p>We study the geodesics on the manifold of mixed quantum states for the Bures metric. It is shown that these geodesics correspond to physical non-Markovian evolutions of the system coupled to an ancilla. Furthermore, we argue that geodesics lead to optimal precision in single-parameter estimation in quantum metrology. More precisely, if the unknown parameter $x$ is a phase shift proportional to the time parametrizing the geodesic, the estimation error obtained by processing the data of measurements on the system is equal to the smallest error that can be achieved from joint detections on the system and ancilla, meaning that there is no information loss on this parameter in the ancilla. This error can saturate the Heisenberg bound. Reciprocally, assuming that the system-ancilla output and input states are related by a unitary $e^{-i x H}$ with $H$ a $x$-independent Hamiltonian, we show that if the error obtained from measurements on the system is equal to the minimal error obtained from joint measurements on the system and ancilla then the system evolution is given by a geodesic. In such a case, the measurement on the system bringing most information on $x$ is $x$-independent and can be determined in terms of the intersections of the geodesic with the boundary of quantum states. These results show that geodesic evolutions are of interest for high-precision detections in systems coupled to an ancilla in the absence of measurements on the ancilla.</p>

            <p>Integration of quantum computing in generative machine learning models has the potential to offer benefits such as training speed-up and superior feature extraction. However, the existing quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) fail to generate high-quality images due to their patch-based, pixel-wise learning approaches.

In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a quantum image generative learning (QIGL) approach for high-quality medical image generation. Our proposed quantum generator leverages variational quantum circuit approach addressing scalability issues by extracting principal components from the images instead of dividing them into patches. Additionally, we integrate the Wasserstein distance within the QIGL framework to generate a diverse set of medical samples.

Notably, this approach proves particularly effective for assessing $k$-entanglement, as we show its ability to extend previously established inequalities. To enhance understanding, we also demonstrate how this framework applies to specific scenarios, encompassing both finite-dimensional cases and infinite-dimensional systems, the latter being exemplified by the time-frequency modal degree of freedom of co-propagating single photons.</p>

            <p>The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.</p>

            <p>Modeling and simulating the protein folding process overall remains a grand challenge in computational biology. We systematically investigate end-to-end quantum algorithms for simulating various protein dynamics with effects, such as mechanical forces or stochastic noises. A major focus is the read-in of system settings for simulation, for which we discuss (i) efficient quantum algorithms to prepare initial states--whether for ensemble or single-state simulations, in particular, the first efficient procedure for preparing Gaussian pseudo-random amplitude states, and (ii) the first efficient loading of the connectivity matrices of the protein structure. For the read-out stage, our algorithms estimate a range of classical observables, including energy, low-frequency vibrational modes, density of states, displacement correlations, and optimal control parameters. Between these stages, we simulate the dynamic evolution of the protein system, by using normal mode models--such as Gaussian network models (GNM) and all-atom normal mode models. In addition, we conduct classical numerical experiments focused on accurately estimating the density of states and applying optimal control to facilitate conformational changes. These experiments serve to validate our claims regarding potential quantum speedups. Overall, our study demonstrates that quantum simulation of protein dynamics represents a robust, end-to-end application for both early-stage and fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Ergodicity has been one of the fundamental concepts underpinning our understanding of thermalization in isolated systems since the first developments in classical statistical mechanics. Recently, a similar notion has been introduced for quantum systems, termed complete Hilbert space ergodicity (CHSE), in which the evolving quantum state explores all of the available Hilbert space. This contrasts with the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH), in which thermalisation is formulated via the properties of matrix elements of local operators in the energy eigenbasis. In this work we explore how ETH-violation mechanisms, including quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation can affect complete Hilbert space ergodicity. We find that the presence of these mechanisms leads to CHSE in decoupled subspaces, a phenomenon we call Hilbert Subspace Ergodicity, and which represents a protocol for constructing t-designs in subspaces.</p>

            <h2>Quantum enhanced beam tracking surpassing the Heisenberg uncertainty limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingwen Zhang, Duncan England, Noah Lupu-Gladstein, Frederic Bouchard, Guillaume Thekkadath, Philip J. Bustard, Ebrahim Karimi, Benjamin Sussman</p>
            <p>Determining a beam's full trajectory requires tracking both its position and momentum (angular) information. However, the product of position and momentum uncertainty in a simultaneous measurement of the two parameters is bound by the Heisenberg uncertainty limit (HUL). In this work, we present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum-enhanced beam tracking technique, leveraging the inherent position and momentum entanglement between photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). We show that quantum entanglement can be exploited to achieve a beam tracking accuracy beyond the HUL in a simultaneous measurement. Moreover, with existing detection technologies, it is already possible to achieve near real-time beam tracking capabilities at the single-photon level. The technique also exhibits high resilience to background influences, with negligible reduction in tracking accuracy even when subjected to a disruptive beam that is significantly brighter than SPDC.</p>

            <p>Advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing and fundamental science necessitates quantum-limited amplifiers with near-ideal quantum efficiency and multiplexing capability. However, existing solutions typically achieve one at the expense of the other. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first Floquet-mode traveling-wave parametric amplifier (Floquet TWPA), which achieves nearly quantum-limited noise performance, minimal dissipation, and broadband operation, breaking the presumption that broadband amplifiers introduce higher noise. We achieve a system measurement efficiency of $65.1\pm5.8\%$ when measuring a superconducting qubit, which to our knowledge is the highest-reported in a superconducting qubit readout experiment utilizing phase-preserving amplifiers. Our device exhibits $>20$-dB amplification over a $3$-GHz instantaneous bandwidth, $<\!0.5\,$-dB average in-band insertion loss, and the highest reported intrinsic quantum efficiency for a TWPA of $92.1\pm7.6\%$, relative to an ideal phase-preserving amplifier. Fabricated in a superconducting qubit process, these general-purpose Floquet TWPAs are suitable for fast, high-fidelity multiplexed readout in large-scale quantum systems and future monolithic integration with quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenan Wei, Liu Yang, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians describe open quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and dissipative processes. Although a rich range of single-particle NH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH systems have been far less well studied. The Kondo effect, an important paradigm for strong correlation physics, has recently been considered in the NH setting. Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization group (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative solution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase diagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo model, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable fixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in regimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe ansatz, is provided open source.</p>

            <h2>No-Go Theorems for Universal Quantum State Purification via Classically Simulable Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keming He, Chengkai Zhu, Hongshun Yao, Jinguo Liu, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum state purification, a process that aims to recover a state closer to a system's principal eigenstate from multiple copies of an unknown noisy quantum state, is crucial for restoring noisy states to a more useful form in quantum information processing. Fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on stabilizer operations, which are classically simulable protocols critical for error correction but inherently limited in computational power. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classically simulable operations for quantum state purification. We demonstrate that while certain classically simulable operations can enhance fidelity for specific noisy state ensembles, they cannot achieve universal purification. We prove that neither deterministic nor probabilistic protocols using only classically simulable operations can achieve universal purification of two-copy noisy states for qubit systems and all odd dimensions. We further extend this no-go result of state purification using three and four copies via numerical computations of semidefinite programs. Our findings highlight the indispensable role of non-stabilizer resources and the inherent limitations of classically simulable operations in quantum state purification, emphasizing the necessity of harnessing the full power of quantum operations for more robust quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>An Efficient Quantum Classifier Based on Hamiltonian Representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Tiblias, Anna Schroeder, Yue Zhang, Mariami Gachechiladze, Iryna Gurevych</p>
            <p>Quantum machine learning (QML) is a discipline that seeks to transfer the advantages of quantum computing to data-driven tasks. However, many studies rely on toy datasets or heavy feature reduction, raising concerns about their scalability. Progress is further hindered by hardware limitations and the significant costs of encoding dense vector representations on quantum devices. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient approach called Hamiltonian classifier that circumvents the costs associated with data encoding by mapping inputs to a finite set of Pauli strings and computing predictions as their expectation values. In addition, we introduce two classifier variants with different scaling in terms of parameters and sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on text and image classification tasks, against well-established classical and quantum models. The Hamiltonian classifier delivers performance comparable to or better than these methods. Notably, our method achieves logarithmic complexity in both qubits and quantum gates, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-world applications. We make our implementation available on GitHub.</p>

            <p>The Casimir effect and superconductivity are foundational quantum phenomena whose interaction remains an open question in physics. How Casimir forces behave across a superconducting transition remains unresolved, owing to the experimental difficulty of achieving alignment, cryogenic environments, and isolating small changes from competing effects. This question carries implications for electron physics, quantum gravity, and high-temperature superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an on-chip superconducting platform that overcomes these challenges, achieving one of the most parallel Casimir configurations to date. Our microchip-based cavities achieve unprecedented area-to-separation ratio between plates, exceeding previous Casimir experiments by orders of magnitude and generating the strongest Casimir forces yet between compliant surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used for the first time to directly detect the resonant motion of a suspended membrane, with subatomic precision in both lateral positioning and displacement. Such precision measurements across a superconducting transition allow for the suppression of all van der Waals, electrostatic, and thermal effects. Preliminary measurements suggest superconductivity-dependent shifts in the Casimir force, motivating further investigation and comparison with theories. By uniting extreme parallelism, nanomechanics, and STM readout, our platform opens a new experimental frontier at the intersection of Casimir physics and superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Loaiza, Stepan Fomichev, Danial Motlagh, Pablo A.M. Casares, Daniel Honciuc Menendez, Serene Shum, Alain Delgado, Juan Miguel Arrazola</p>
            <p>Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive, low-cost, reagent-less, and rapid technique to measure chemical concentrations in a wide variety of sample types. However, extracting concentration information from the NIR spectrum requires training a statistical model on a large collection of measurements, which can be impractical, expensive, or dangerous. In this work, we propose a method for simulating NIR spectra on a quantum computer, as part of a larger workflow to improve NIR-based chemical detection. The quantum algorithm is highly optimized, exhibiting a cost reduction of many orders of magnitude relative to prior approaches. The main optimizations include the localization of vibrational modes, an efficient real-space-based representation of the Hamiltonian with a quantum arithmetic-based implementation of the time-evolution, optimal Trotter step size determination, and specific targeting of the NIR region. Overall, our algorithm achieves a O(M^2) scaling, compared with the O(M^12) coming from equivalent high-accuracy classical methods. As a concrete application, we show that simulating the spectrum of azidoacetylene (HC2N3), a highly explosive molecule with strong anharmonicities consisting of M = 12 vibrational modes, requires circuits with a maximum 8.47 x 10^8 T gates and 173 logical qubits. By enhancing the training datasets of detection models, the full potential of vibrational spectroscopy for chemical detection could be unlocked across a range of applications, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and medical sensing.</p>

            <p>We describe a method for simulating and characterizing realistic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) cluster states, rooted in the representation of resource states in terms of sums of Gaussian distributions in phase space. We apply our method to study the generation of single-mode GKP states via cat state breeding, and the formation of multimode GKP cluster states via linear optical circuits and homodyne measurements. We characterize resource states by referring to expectation values of their stabilizers, and witness operators constructed from them. Our method reproduces the results of standard Fock-basis simulations, while being more efficient, and being applicable in a broader parameter space. We also comment on the validity of the heuristic Gaussian random noise (GRN) model, through comparisons with our exact simulations: We find discrepancies in the stabilizer expectation values when homodyne measurement is involved in cluster state preparation, yet we find a close agreement between the two approaches on average.</p>

            <p>We propose a method to cool a thermal photonic state in a cavity by passing electrons through it. Electrons are coherently split into two paths, with one path traversing the cavity, becoming entangled with its photonic state. A sequence of such entanglement interactions can achieve cooling of the cavity: e.g., a twofold reduction in thermal photon number with a 25% post-selection probability. This ``which-path''-based approach extends to other qubit oscillator systems, such as phonons in crystals or optomechanical resonators, offering a general framework for quantum oscillator cooling.</p>

            <p>We measured the relaxation and decoherence rates of a superconducting transmon qubit in a resonator-free setting. In our experiments, the qubit is coupled to an open coplanar waveguide such that the transmission of microwaves through this line depends on the qubit's state. To determine the occupation of the first excited qubit energy level, we introduced a two-pulse technique. The first applied pulse, at a frequency close to the eigenfrequency of the qubit, serves to excite the qubit. A second pulse is then used for probing the transition between the first and second excited energy levels. Utilizing this measurement technique allowed for the reconstruction of the relaxation dynamics and Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consistency between the extracted parameters and the corresponding estimations from frequency-domain measurements.</p>

            <p>This chapter explores various aspects of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) and its implications in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We begin by reviewing the origin and fundamental properties of the DCE, including three equivalent mathematical frameworks that offer complementary perspectives on the phenomenon. These formulations will serve as a foundation for the subsequent analyses. We then turn our attention to the practical realization of the DCE in cQED-based architectures, discussing how modern superconducting circuits can be engineered to exhibit this inherently quantum effect. Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the performance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field, shedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic processes. Further, we demonstrate how the DCE can be harnessed to implement a controlled-squeeze gate within a cQED platform, opening a path toward advanced quantum control and quantum information processing. The chapter concludes with a synthesis of the main results and a discussion of potential future directions.</p>

            <p>Analyzing the kinetics of biological processes plays a significant role in understanding fundamental cellular functions. Many physics-based technologies used to study such processes are limited by the shot noise inherent to the coherent states of light. These technologies can greatly benefit by leveraging quantum probes to improve the sensitivity of measurements in cellular biology. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique has been used effectively to achieve label-free, real-time measurements of protein binding kinetics, which constitutes an important biological phenomenon occurring near the cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate the integration of this technique with the two-mode bright squeezed state having fewer fluctuations as compared to the coherent state to improve the sensitivity of measurement in studying a protein-gold adsorption process. We show 4dB of squeezing as we record the signal-to-noise ratio as the function of time and it is maintained throughout the kinetic process. The quantum advantage as shown in terms of squeezing is achieved despite the total absorption of 74% from the source until the final detection after the sensor. Overall, we provide the most practical setup for improving the sensitivity of the time-dependent measurements involved in various biological processes at the molecular level.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.</p>

            <p>Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which can easily relax the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential.

However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline, and evaluates its performance relative to its classical counterpart.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing offers new opportunities for addressing complex classification tasks in biomedical applications. This study investigates two quantum machine learning models-the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) and the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)-in the context of B-cell epitope prediction, a key step in modern vaccine design. QSVM builds upon the classical SVM framework by using quantum circuits to encode nonlinear kernel computations, while VQC replaces the entire classification pipeline with trainable quantum circuits optimized variationally. A benchmark dataset from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is used for model evaluation. Each epitope is represented by 10 physicochemical features, and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to assess model performance across different feature spaces. We also examine the effect of sample size on prediction outcomes. Experimental results show that QSVM performs well under limited data conditions, while VQC achieves higher accuracy in larger datasets. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced models for bioinformatics tasks, particularly in supporting efficient and scalable epitope-based vaccine development.</p>

            <p>The expressiveness of quantum programming languages plays a crucial role in the efficient and comprehensible representation of quantum algorithms. Unlike classical programming languages, which offer mature and well-defined abstraction mechanisms, quantum languages must integrate cognitively challenging concepts such as superposition, interference and entanglement while maintaining clarity and usability. However, identifying and characterizing differences in expressiveness between quantum programming paradigms remains an open area of study. Our work investigates the landscape of expressiveness through a comparative analysis of hosted quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, Qrisp, and quAPL, and standalone languages including Q# and Qmod. We focused on evaluating how different quantum programming languages support the implementation of core quantum algorithms -- Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover -- using expressiveness metrics: Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), and Halstead Complexity (HC) metrics as proxies for developer productivity. Our findings suggest that different quantum programming paradigms offer distinct trade-offs between expressiveness and productivity, highlighting the importance of language design in quantum software development.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</p>

These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel "lattice grafting" optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Network Requirements for Distributed Quantum Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Jacinto, Élie Gouzien, Nicolas Sangouard</p>
            <p>Physical constraints and engineering challenges, including wafer dimensions, classical control cabling, and refrigeration volumes, impose significant limitations on the scalability of quantum computing units. As a result, a modular quantum computing architecture, comprising small processors interconnected by quantum links, is emerging as a promising approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the requirements that the network must fulfill to enable distributed quantum computation remain largely unexplored. We consider an architecture tailored for qubits with nearest-neighbor physical connectivity, leveraging the surface code for error correction and enabling fault-tolerant operations through lattice surgery and magic state distillation. We propose measurement teleportation as a tool to extend lattice surgery techniques to qubits located on different computing units interconnected via Bell pairs. Through memory simulations, we build an error model for logical operations and deduce an end-to-end resource estimation of Shor's algorithm over a minimalist distributed architecture. Concretely, for a characteristic physical gate error rate of 1e-3, a processor cycle time of 1 microsecond, factoring a 2048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible with 379 computing processors, each made with 89781 qubits, with negligible space and time overhead with respect to a monolithic approach without parallelization, if 70 Bell pairs are available per cycle time between each processor with a fidelity exceeding 98.4 percent.</p>

            <p>Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</p>

            <p>The Quantum Internet, a network of quantum-enabled infrastructure, represents the next frontier in telecommunications, promising unprecedented capabilities that cannot be attained by classical counterparts. A crucial step in realizing such large-scale quantum networks is the integration of entanglement distribution within existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate a real-world scalable quantum networking testbed deployed within Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fibers in Berlin. Using commercially available quantum devices and standard add-drop multiplexing hardware, we distribute polarization-entangled photon pairs over dynamically selectable fiber paths ranging from 10 m to 82 km. Quantum signals, transmitted at 1324 nm (O-band), coexist with conventional bidirectional C-band traffic without dedicated fibers or infrastructure changes. Active stabilization of the polarization enables robust long-term performance, achieving entanglement fidelities between 85-99% and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter S-values between 2.36-2.74 during continuous multiday operation. By achieving high-fidelity entanglement distribution under real urban conditions with less than 1% downtime, we confirm the feasibility of hybrid quantum-classical networks under real-world conditions at metropolitan scale. These results establish deployment benchmarks and provide a practical roadmap for telecom operators to integrate quantum capabilities.</p>

However, a major challenge in quantum simulation, and quantum computation in general, is to solve problems with limited physical hardware. Currently, this challenge is tackled by designing dedicated devices for specific models, thereby allowing to reduce control requirements and simplify the construction. Here, we suggest a new method for quantum simulation in circuit QED, that provides versatility in model design and complete control over its parameters with minimal hardware requirements. We show how these features manifest through examples of quantum simulation of Dirac dynamics, which is relevant to the study of both high-energy physics and 2D materials. We conclude by discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed method.</p>

            <p>We analyze the non-Markovian spontaneous emission dynamics of a two-level test atom placed in a cavity formed by two atomic arrays in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup. We demonstrate a crossover from single-mode to multimode strong coupling cavity QED as the cavity length $ \sim d$ becomes comparable to the coherence length associated with collective spontaneous emission $\sim v/(N\gamma)$. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics of the test atom and the emergent spectral density of the field are analyzed as a function of various tunable atomic array parameters: number of atoms, length of the atomic cavity, and resonance frequency of the atoms forming the atomic mirrors. Our results show limitations to cooperatively enhanced light-matter coupling in the presence of time-delayed feedback. We further illustrate that the non-Markovian system dynamics can be efficiently approximated in terms of a few modes of the emergent spectral density of the field.</p>

Here we demonstrate a few-emitter cavity QED system capable of realizing new Hamiltonians in quantum optics based on breaking of symmetries and the realization of an in situ Kerr nonlinearity. Our experiment relies on a high-finesse silicon carbide whispering gallery mode resonator hosting an ensemble of silicon vacancy color centers. The simultaneous presence of spectral and spatial disorder of the mesoscopic atom system gives rise to emergent chirality, and the optical nonlinearity of the silicon carbide host crystal enables the observation of atom-photon correlations induced by a four-photon nonlinear process.

            <p>The strong coupling between an emitter and a cavity is significant for advancing quantum networks. Due to their long optical and spin coherence times, rare-earth ions (REIs) represent a compelling platform for quantum networks. However, their inherently weak intra-4f optical transitions typically result in low coupling strength, thus restricting most current achievements to the weak coupling regime. This work proposes a scheme to realize an on-chip quantum network by coupling REIs to high-quality whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavities. Additionally, we provide numerical validation for a parametric amplification technique to enhance the emitter-cavity coupling strength. As an extension of this approach, the coupled system efficiently achieves the quantum entanglement of local and flying qubits. This study deepens the understanding of emitter-cavity interactions and contributes to realizing REIs-based photonic platforms, which are crucial to distributed quantum computing and developing robust quantum networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhao, Guming Zhao, Shaowei Li, Chen Zha, Ming Gong, XiaoBo Zhu</p>
            <p>The fluxonium qubit has emerged as a promising candidate for superconducting quantum computing due to its long coherence times and high-fidelity gates. Nonetheless, further scaling up and improving performance remain critical challenges for establishing fluxoniums as a viable alternative to transmons. A key obstacle lies in developing scalable coupling architectures. In this work, we introduce a scalable fluxonium architecture that enables decoupling of qubit states while maintaining tunable couplings between non-computational states. Beyond the well-studied ZZ crosstalk, we identify that an always-on interaction involving non-computational levels can significantly degrade the fidelities of initialization, control, and readout in large systems, thereby impeding scalability. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by implementing tunable couplings for fluxonium's plasmon transitions, meanwhile enabling fast, high-fidelity gates with passive ZZ suppression. Furthermore, since fluxonium transitions span multiple frequency octaves, we emphasize the importance of carefully designing coupling mechanisms and parameters to suppress residual interactions.</p>

            <p>To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical resource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks, semiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases efficiency and bandwidth, but it also introduces environmental charge instability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon colour centres have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum technologies. Here we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in nanophotonics-coupled, individual silicon T centres using spectral correlation measurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by the near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5 ms in the dark. We demonstrate a 35x narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110 MHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise entanglement rates and optical resource state generators. Finally, we report laser-induced spin-mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms common to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T centre devices for high-performance entanglement generation.</p>

            <p>Quantum technologies hold promise as essential components for the upcoming deployment of the future 6G network. In this future network, the security and trustworthiness requirements are not considered fulfilled with the current state of the quantum computers, as the malicious behaviour on the part of the service provider towards the user may still be present. Therefore, this article provides an initial interdisciplinary work of regulations and solutions in the scope of trustworthy quantum computing for future 6G that can be viewed as complimentary regulations to the existing strategies shared by different actors of states and organizations. More precisely, we describe the importance of a reliable quantum service provider and its implication on the ethical aspects concerning digital sovereignty. By exploring the critical relationship between trustworthiness and digital sovereignty in the context of future 6G networks, we analyse a trade-off between accessibility to this new technology and preservation of digital sovereignty engaging in parallel the United Nation's (UN's) sustainable development goals. Furthermore, we propose a partnership model based on cooperation, coordination, and collaboration giving rise to a trusted, ethical, and inclusive quantum ecosystem, whose implications can spill over to the entire global scenario.</p>

            <p>In the Quantum Internet, multipartite entanglement enables a new form of network connectivity, referred to as artificial connectivity namely and able to augment the physical connectivity with artificial links between pairs of nodes, without any additional physical link deployment. In this paper, by engineering such an artificial connectivity, we theoretically determine upper and lower bounds for the number of EPR pairs and GHZ states that can be extracted among nodes that are not adjacent in the artificial network topology. The aforementioned analysis is crucial, since the extraction of EPR pairs and GHZ states among remote nodes constitutes the resource primitives for on-demand and end-to-end communications. Indeed, within the paper, we not only determine whether a certain number of remote EPR pairs and GHZ states can be extracted, but we also provide the locations, namely the identities, of the nodes interconnected by such entangled resources. Thus, our analysis is far from being purely theoretical, rather it is constructive, since we provide the sequence of operations required for performing such extractions.</p>

At last, we demonstrate that our improved error analysis leads to significant resource-saving for fault-tolerant Trotter simulation.

            <p>Cross-talk between qubits is one of the main challenges for scaling superconducting quantum processors. Here, we use the density-matrix renormalization-group to numerically analyze lattices of superconducting qubits from a perspective of many-body localization. Specifically, we compare different architectures that include tunable couplers designed to decouple qubits in the idle state, and calculate the residual ZZ interactions as well as the inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states. For transmon qubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable C-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ interactions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture with tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong suppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of transmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may feature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve similar gate speeds and fidelities.</p>

Combined with techniques from Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, we show that properties such as PARITY and MAJORITY are compression oblivious for certain circuit class $\Lambda$ if subexponentially secure quantum pseudorandom functions exist in $\Lambda$, answering an open question in [Buhrman-Patro-Speelman 2021].</p>

            <p>The study of holographic bulk-boundary dualities has led to the construction of novel quantum error correcting codes. Although these codes have shed new light on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a new class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction generalizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated codes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the holographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high erasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed codes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes achieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\%$ reduction for a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard concatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations with tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal fault-tolerant gate sets. Therefore, our work strengthens the case for the utility of holographic quantum codes for practical quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Characterization of near-term quantum computing platforms requires the ability to capture and quantify dissipative effects. This is an inherently challenging task, as these effects are multifaceted, spanning a broad spectrum from Markovian to strongly non-Markovian dynamics. We introduce Quantum Liouvillian Tomography (QLT), a protocol to capture and quantify non-Markovian effects in time-continuous quantum dynamics. The protocol leverages gradient-based quantum process tomography to reconstruct dynamical maps and utilizes regression over the derivatives of Pauli string probability distributions to extract the Liouvillian governing the dynamics. We benchmark the protocol using synthetic data and quantify its accuracy in recovering Hamiltonians, jump operators, and dissipation rates for two-qubit systems. Finally, we apply QLT to analyze the evolution of an idling two-qubit system implemented on a superconducting quantum platform to extract characteristics of Hamiltonian and dissipative components and, as a result, detect inherently non-Markovian dynamics. Our work introduces the first protocol capable of retrieving generators of generic open quantum evolution from experimental data, thus enabling more precise characterization of many-body non-Markovian effects in near-term quantum computing platforms.</p>

The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned.

We prove that capacities of such channels are approximately strongly additive and can be efficiently approximated in terms of the structure of their peripheral spaces. Furthermore, the quantum and private classical capacities of such channels approximately coincide and approximately satisfy the strong converse property. We show that these approximate results become exact for the corresponding zero-error capacities when $l \geq d^2$. To prove these results, we show that for any channel $\Psi$, the classical, private classical, and quantum capacities of $\Psi_\infty$, which is its so-called asymptotic part, satisfy the strong converse property and are strongly additive. In the zero-error case, we introduce the notion of the stabilized non-commutative confusability graph of a quantum channel and characterize its structure for any given channel.</p>

By mapping quantum states to classical data points through strategic observable measurements, we create a "quantum state cloud" analyzable via persistent homology techniques. Our framework establishes that quantum systems in the same topological phase exhibit consistent barcode representations with shared persistent homology groups over characteristic intervals. We prove that quantum phase transitions manifest as significant changes in these persistent homology features, detectable through discontinuities in the persistent Dirac operator spectrum. Using the SSH model as a demonstrative example, we show how our approach successfully identifies the topological phase transition and distinguishes between trivial and topological phases. While primarily developed for symmetry-protected topological phases, our framework provides a mathematical connection between persistent homology and quantum topology, offering new methods for phase classification that complement traditional invariant-based approaches.</p>

Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun Woo P. Kim, Curt von Keyserlingk, Austen Lamacraft</p>
            <p>Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Magnon Polaritons via Eddy-Current-Induced Dissipation in Metallic-Banded YIG Spheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsushi Uno, Shugo Yoshii, Sotaro Mae, Ei Shigematsu, Ryo Ohshima, Yuichiro Ando, Masashi Shiraishi</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a robust method to dynamically tune magnon dissipation in yttrium iron garnet spheres by equipping a metallic band around the sphere's equator, enabling precise control over magnon-photon coupling states. The collective magnetization dynamics in the YIG sphere induce circular eddy currents in the metallic band, whose magnitude can be systematically varied by adjusting the angle between the metallic band plane and an external static magnetic field. This angular dependence yields a pronounced modulation of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth, facilitating seamless transitions between the Purcell and strong coupling regimes without altering photon cavity parameters. Systematic FMR and cavity spectroscopy measurements confirm that eddy-current-induced losses govern the primary mechanism behind the observed tunable damping. By achieving extensive periodic-angular dependence of magnon relaxation rate, we precisely control the magnon-photon coupling state, approaching the critical coupling condition. These results establish the YIG-metallic-band platform as a versatile and practical approach for engineering tunable magnon-polariton systems and advancing magnonic applications, including those exploring non-Hermitian magnonics.</p>

            <h2>Observability of Acausal and Uncorrelated Optical-Quasar Pairs for Quantum-Mechanical Experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Steinbring</p>
            <p>Viewing high-redshift sources at near-opposite directions on the sky can assure, by light-travel-time arguments, acausality between their emitted photons. One utility would be true random-number generation, by sensing these via two independent telescopes that each flip a switch based on those latest-arrived colours; for example, to autonomously control a quantum-mechanical (QM) experiment. Although demonstrated with distant quasars, those were not fully acausal pairs, which are restricted in simultaneous view from the ground at any single observatory. In optical light such faint sources also require large telescope aperture to avoid sampling assumptions when imaged at fast camera framerates: either unsensed intrinsic correlations between them or equivalently-correlated noise may ruin the expectation of pure randomness. One such case which could spoil a QM test is considered. Based on that, allowed geometries and instrumental limits are modelled for any two ground-based sites, and their data simulated. To compare, an analysis of photometry from the Gemini twin 8-m telescopes is presented, using archival data of well-separated bright stars, obtained with the instruments 'Alopeke (on Gemini-North in Hawai'i) and Zorro (on Gemini-South in Chile) simultaneously in two bands (centred at 562 nm and 832 nm) with 17 Hz framerate. No flux correlation is found, calibrating an analytic model, predicting where a search at signal-to-noise over 50 at 50 Hz with the same instrumentation can be made. Finally, the software PDQ (Predict Different Quasars) is presented which searches a large catalogue of known quasars, reporting those with brightness and visibility suitable to verify acausal, uncorrelated photons at those limits.</p>

            <h2>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</h2>

            <p>Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for linking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingying Han, Changfa He, Zhenxiong Weng, Peng Xu, Yanting Zhao, Tao Wang</p>
            <p>We present a Rydberg-atom interferometry-based technique for voltage measurement between electrodes embedded in an atomic vapor cell, enabling the detection of weak voltages ($<0.1$V) and unambiguous discrimination between positive and negative polarities. This makes up for the shortcomings of measurements based on the Stark effect, which suffer from quadratic field dependence (limiting sensitivity in weak-field regimes) and incapable of distinguishing the electric field direction. Furthermore, this method extends naturally to power-frequency (PF) electric field measurements by exploiting the quasi-static approximation-valid given the PF field's characteristic timescale ($\sim10^{-2}$s) vastly exceeds the interferometric measurement duration ($\sim10^{-6}$s). Crucially, our protocol provides instantaneous PF field reconstruction, providing comprehensive information including amplitude, frequency and phase. These advancements have direct implications for traceable voltage measurements and non-invasive characterization of PF fields near high-voltage infrastructure.</p>

            <p>In recent years, micromachined vapor cells have been revolutionizing the field of chip-scale quantum sensors such as magnetometers and atomic clocks. In parallel, Rydberg atomic quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful technique for broadband, non-invasive, and ultra-sensitive electrometry. Yet, to date, Rydberg sensing has largely been limited to glass-blown, cm-scale vapor cells. Here, we perform Rydberg spectroscopy using a wafer-scale fabricated Pyrex-Si-Pyrex cell with mm-scale dimensions. The Rydberg spectroscopic line is characterized with respect to critical parameters such as temperature, the frequency and amplitude of the applied radiofrequency field, light intensity, and the spatial position of atom interrogation. Our study reveals lineshapes directly influenced by a complex landscape of electrostatic fields with values up to approximately $0.6\ \mathrm{V/cm}$. By controlling key parameters, we were able to reduce the effect of these internal electric fields and demonstrate the detection of RF fields with a sensitivity as low as $10\ \mu\mathrm{V/cm}$. These results highlight the potential of micromachined vapor cells for sub-wavelength electromagnetic field measurements, with applications in communications, near-field RF imaging, and chip-scale quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. I. Mukhin</p>
            <p>Proposed recently by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates (2022) was supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (2023). In the present paper it is demonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity arises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding experimental data in the "strange metal" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as reviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the "strange metal" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by this http URL et al. (2010) in the "strange metal" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a possible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$ cuprates in the "strange metal" phase of their phase diagram. We believe , these results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model of the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Spin: Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn</p>
            <p>We present a novel stochastic variational method (SVM) for quantizing non-relativistic spinless particles in curved spaces with torsion. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited for quantization in general coordinate systems and shows that torsion, typically associated with spin, can influence the quantum dynamics of spinless particles through quantum fluctuations. In a flat space, this torsion-induced effect appears as a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation, which is relevant to studies of solitons, wave function collapse, and possible modifications to conventional quantum mechanics. Since torsion arises in various modified gravity theories, particularly those related to the early universe and dark matter, our findings suggest a new mechanism through which such effects may impact quantum behavior. We also provide a rough estimate for the upper bound of the torsion magnitude.</p>

Excitation to Rydberg states induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.38~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. This level of sensitivity is sufficient to resolve the Rydberg transition of a single electron, providing a scalable pathway toward the implementation of qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</p>

            <p>One-dimensional scattering of a wave packet of a relativistic fermion under a temporally oscillating electric field superimposed on a potential step is discussed by using the Furry-picture perturbation theory, where the oscillating electric field is treated as a perturbation. Reflection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet, which in its single-mode limit are consistent with those in the stationary scattering off the potential step alone, are investigated up to the second order. We show that even in the absence of the so-called Klein region, a positive-frequency incoming wave can penetrate the negative-frequency region below the potential step by emitting its energy to the oscillating electric field with a finite tunneling probability.</p>

The black hole information loss paradox arises from semiclassical arguments suggesting that, even in a closed system, the process of black hole formation and evaporation evolves a pure state into a mixed state. Resolution to the paradox typically demands violation of quantum mechanics or relativity in domains where they should hold. Instead, I propose that in a complete theory of quantum gravity, any region $\mathcal{U}$ that could collapse into a black hole should already be described by a mixed state, thus bypassing the paradox entirely. To that end, I present a model in which the universe is in a quantum error-corrected state, such that any local black hole appears mixed and encodes no information locally.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anil Bilgin, Ian N. Hammock, Alexander A. High, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

We show that each discrete-time quantum walk with an appropriate setting of the parameter $\epsilon$ in the long time limit identifies with its induced continuous-time quantum walk and give the running time for the discrete-time to approximate the induced continuous-time quantum walk with a small error $\delta$. We also investigate the detailed spectral information on the induced continuous-time quantum walk.</p>

            <p>Thermalization phenomena, while ubiquitous in quantum systems, have traditionally been viewed as obstacles to be mitigated. In this study, we demonstrate the ability, instead, to harness thermalization to dynamically engineer and stabilize structured quantum states in a mesoscopically large ensemble of spins. Specifically, we showcase the capacity to generate, control, stabilize, and read out 'shell-like' spin texture with interacting $ {}^{ 13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The texture spans several nanometers and encompasses many hundred spins. We capitalize on the thermalization process to impose a quasi-equilibrium upon the generated texture; as a result, it is highly stable, immune to spin diffusion, and endures over multiple-minute long periods -- over a million times longer than the intrinsic interaction scale of the spins. Additionally, the texture is created and interrogated without locally controlling or probing the nuclear spins. These features are accomplished using an electron spin as a nanoscale injector of spin polarization, and employing it as a source of spatially varying dissipation, allowing for serial readout of the emergent spin texture. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-induced Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field. Our work presents a new approach to robust nanoscale spin state engineering and paves the way for new applications in quantum simulation, quantum information science, and nanoscale imaging.</p>

            <p>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems have garnered significant attention due to their unconventional properties. Despite the growing interest, there remains an ongoing debate about whether these systems outperform their Hermitian counterparts in practical applications, and if so, by what metrics this performance should be measured. We developed $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric approach for mapping $N = 3$ pure qubit states to address this, implemented it using the dilation method, and demonstrated it on a superconducting quantum processor from the IBM Quantum Experience. For the first time, we derived exact expressions for the population of the post-selected $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric subspace for both $N = 2$ and $N = 3$ states. When applied to the discrimination of $N = 2$ pure states, our algorithm provides an equivalent result to the conventional unambiguous quantum state discrimination. For $N = 3$ states, our approach introduces novel capabilities not available in traditional Hermitian systems, enabling the transformation of an arbitrary set of three pure quantum states into another, at the cost of introducing an inconclusive outcome. Our algorithm has the same error rate for the attack on the three-state QKD protocol as the conventional minimum error, maximum confidence, and maximum mutual information strategies. For post-selected quantum metrology, our results provide precise conditions where $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum sensors outperform their Hermitian counterparts in terms of information-cost rate. Combined with punctuated unstructured quantum database search, our method significantly reduces the qubit readout requirements at the cost of adding an ancilla, while maintaining the same average number of oracle calls as the original punctuated Grover's algorithm. Our work opens new pathways for applying $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in quantum communications, computing, and cryptography.</p>

            <p>The use of higher-dimensional photonic encodings (qudits) instead of two-dimensional encodings (qubits) can improve the loss tolerance and reduce the computational resources of photonic-based quantum information processing. To harness this potential, efficient schemes for entangling operations such as the high-dimensional generalization of a linear optics Bell measurement will be required. We show how an efficient high-dimensional entangled state analyzer can be implemented with a linear optics interferometer and auxiliary photonic states. The degree of entanglement of the auxiliary state is much less than in previous protocols as quantified by an exponentially smaller Schmidt rank. In addition, the auxiliary state only occupies a single spatial mode, allowing it to be generated deterministically from a single quantum emitter coupled to a small qubit register. The reduced complexity of the auxiliary states results in a high robustness to imperfections and we show that auxiliary states with fidelities above 0.9 for qudit dimensions 4 can be generated in the presence of qubit error rates on the order of 10%. This paves the way for experimental demonstrations with current hardware.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the complexity of graph-state preparation. We consider general quantum algorithms consisting of Clifford operations acting on at most two qubits for graph-state preparations. We define the CZ-complexity of a graph state $|G\rangle$ as the minimum number of two-qubit Clifford operations (excluding single-qubit Clifford operations) for generating $|G\rangle$ from a trivial state $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$. We first prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ two-qubit Clifford operations if and only if $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ controlled-Z (CZ) operations. We next prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated from another graph state $|H\rangle$ by $t$ CZ operations if and only if the graph $G$ is generated from $H$ by some combinatorial graph transformation with cost $t$. As the main results, we show a connection between the CZ-complexity of graph state $|G\rangle$ and the rank-width of the graph $G$. Indeed, we prove that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and rank-width $r$, 1. The CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is $O(rn)$. 2. If $G$ is connected, the CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is at least $n + r - 2$. We also demonstrate the existence of graph states whose CZ-complexities are close to the upper and lower bounds. Finally, we present quantum algorithms for preparing graph states for three specific graph classes related to intervals: interval graphs, interval containment graphs, and circle graphs. We prove that the CZ-complexity is $O(n)$ for interval graphs, and $O(n\log n)$ for both interval containment graphs and circle graphs.</p>

            <p>Classification is a central task in deep learning algorithms.

This paradigm requires significant resources that scale (at least) linearly in the image resolution, both in terms of photons and computational operations. Here, we present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. It classifies objects without reconstructing their images, using the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical artificial neuron.</p>

            <p>We extend the concept of stochastic energy extraction from quantum batteries to the scenario where both positive operator-valued (POV) and physically realizable non-positive operator-valued measurements (NPOVMs) are applied on the auxiliary connected to the battery in presence of noise. The process involves joint evolution of the battery and the auxiliary, an interaction of the auxiliary with its environment which induces noise in the auxiliary, and performing a POVM or NPOVM on the auxiliary, and finally the selection of a particular measurement outcome. Application of POVM on the auxiliary can be realized by attaching an external system to the auxiliary, which is initially in a product state with the rest of the system, and performing a joint projective measurement on the auxiliary and external. On the other hand, NPOVMs can be performed in two ways: if there are interactions leading to correlations among the auxiliary and environment, then performing a projective measurement on the auxiliary environment system can be interpreted as a physically realizable NPOVM on the auxiliary. Moreover, if there exists interaction among auxiliary, environment and external initially then the global measurement on the auxiliary, environment and external is also effectively an NPOVM on the auxiliary. We find the expressions of the maximum stochastically extractable energy by performing POVMs and NPOVMs of both types on the auxiliary and show that the latter does not depend on the applied noise. Focusing on a particular model of a battery, auxiliary, environment, and external, all being qubits, we show that stochastically extractable energy by POVMs is less than or equal to the same by type-1 NPOVM under various noise models. We additionally consider the case when a limited set of measurement operators is allowed and compare the accessible energy using these restricted set of POVM and NPOVM of type-1.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuhiro Seki, Yuta Kikuchi, Tomoya Hayata, Seiji Yunoki</p>
            <p>Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Observation of a non-Hermitian supersonic mode on a trapped-ion quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Zhang, Juan Carrasquilla, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uesli Alushi, Alessandro Coppo, Valentina Brosco, Roberto Di Candia, Simone Felicetti</p>
            <p>Critical systems represent a valuable resource in quantum sensing and metrology. Critical quantum sensing (CQS) protocols can be realized using finite-component phase transitions, where criticality arises from the rescaling of system parameters rather than the thermodynamic limit. Here, we show that a collective quantum advantage can be achieved in a multipartite CQS protocol using a chain of parametrically coupled critical resonators in the weak-nonlinearity limit. We derive analytical solutions for the low-energy spectrum of this unconventional quantum many-body system, which is composed of locally critical elements. We then assess the scaling of the quantum Fisher information with respect to fundamental resources. We demonstrate that the coupled chain outperforms an equivalent ensemble of independent critical sensors, achieving quadratic scaling in the number of resonators. Finally, we show that even with finite Kerr nonlinearity or Markovian dissipation, the critical chain retains its advantage, making it relevant for implementing quantum sensors with current microwave superconducting technologies.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Second Law of Quantum Resource Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahito Hayashi, Hayata Yamasaki</p>
            <p>The second law of thermodynamics is the cornerstone of physics, characterizing the convertibility between thermodynamic states through a single function, entropy. Given the universal applicability of thermodynamics, a fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether an analogous second law can be formulated to characterize the convertibility of resources for quantum information processing by a single function. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed, linking resource convertibility to the optimal performance of a variant of the quantum version of hypothesis testing. Central to this formulation was the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which aimed to characterize this optimal performance by a measure of quantum resources, the regularized relative entropy of resource. If proven valid, the generalized quantum Stein's lemma would lead to the second law for quantum resources, with the regularized relative entropy of resource taking the role of entropy in thermodynamics. However, in 2023, a logical gap was found in the original proof of this lemma, casting doubt on the possibility of such a formulation of the second law. In this work, we address this problem by developing alternative techniques to successfully prove the generalized quantum Stein's lemma under a smaller set of assumptions than the original analysis. Based on our proof, we reestablish and extend the second law of quantum resource theories, applicable to both static resources of quantum states and a fundamental class of dynamical resources represented by classical-quantum (CQ) channels. These results resolve the fundamental problem of bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</p>

            <p>The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Although one-way functions are well-established as the minimal primitive for classical cryptography, a minimal primitive for quantum cryptography is still unclear. Universal extrapolation, first considered by Impagliazzo and Levin (1990), is hard if and only if one-way functions exist. Towards better understanding minimal assumptions for quantum cryptography, we study the quantum analogues of the universal extrapolation task. Specifically, we put forth the classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation task, where we ask to extrapolate the rest of a bipartite pure state given the first register measured in the computational basis. We then use it as a key component to establish new connections in quantum cryptography: (a) quantum commitments exist if classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard; and (b) classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard if any of the following cryptographic primitives exists: quantum public-key cryptography (such as quantum money and signatures) with a classical public key or 2-message quantum key distribution protocols. For future work, we further generalize the extrapolation task and propose a fully quantum analogue. We show that it is hard if quantum commitments exist, and it is easy for quantum polynomial space.</p>

            <p>Quantum networks (QNs) promise to enhance the performance of various quantum technologies in the near future by distributing entangled states over long distances. The first step towards this is to develop novel entanglement measures that are both informative and computationally tractable at large scales. While numerous such entanglement measures exist for discrete-variable (DV) systems, a comprehensive exploration for experimentally preferred continuous-variable (CV) systems is lacking. Here, we introduce a class of CV entanglement measures, among which we identify a nonconvex entanglement monotone -- the ratio negativity, which possesses a simple, scalable form that determines the exponential decay of optimal entanglement swapping on a chain of pure Gaussian states. This characterization opens avenues for leveraging statistical physics tools to analyze swapping-protocol-based CV QNs.</p>

            <p>Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers significant advantages in terms of high temporal and frequency resolutions and signal-to-noise ratio. Until now, the response-function (RF) formalism has been the prevalent theoretical description. In this study, we compare the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) method with the RF formalism in a three-level system with a constant control field. We obtain the signals from both approaches and compare their population dynamics and 2DCS. We propose the quasi-Green functions for the NHH method, which allows all dominant Liouville paths to be inferred. We further simulate the 2DCS of Rh(CO)$_2$C$_5$H$_7$O$_2$ (RDC) dissolved in hexane with the NHH method, which is in good agreement with the previous experiments. Although the NHH method overestimates relaxations, it provides all important paths by analytical solutions, which are different from the four paths used in the RF formalism. Our results demonstrate that the NHH method is more suitable than the RF formalism for investigating the systems including relaxation and control fields via the 2DCS.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era require algorithms that can generate shallower circuits feasible for today's quantum systems. This is particularly challenging for quantum chemistry applications due to the inherent complexity of molecular systems. Working with pharmaceutically relevant molecules containing sulfonyl fluoride ($SO_2F$) warheads used in targeted covalent drug development, we combine Hamiltonian terms truncation, Clifford Decomposition and Transformation (CDAT), and optimized transpilation techniques to achieve up to a 28.5-fold reduction in circuit depth when assuming all-to-all connectivity of quantum hardware. When employed on IBMQ's Heron architecture, we demonstrate up to a 15.5-fold reduction. Through these methods, we reduced circuit depths to 1330 gates for 8-qubit Hamiltonian dynamics simulations. Using middleware solutions for circuit decomposition, we successfully executed sub-circuits with depths up to 371 gates containing 216 2-qubit gates, representing one of the largest electronic structure Hamiltonian dynamics calculations implemented on current quantum hardware. The systematic circuit reduction approach shows promise for scaling to larger active spaces, while maintaining sufficient accuracy for molecular reactivity predictions using the Quantum-Centric Data-Driven R&D framework.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takumi Kobori, Yasunari Suzuki, Yosuke Ueno, Teruo Tanimoto, Synge Todo, Yuuki Tokunaga</p>
            <p>Current fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) architectures utilize several encoding techniques to enable reliable logical operations with restricted qubit connectivity. However, such logical operations demand additional memory overhead to ensure fault tolerance. Since the main obstacle to practical quantum computing is the limited qubit count, our primary mission is to design floorplans that can reduce memory overhead without compromising computational capability. Despite extensive efforts to explore FTQC architectures, even the current state-of-the-art floorplan strategy devotes 50% of memory space to this overhead, not to data storage, to ensure unit-time random access to all logical qubits. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture based on a novel floorplan strategy, Load/Store Quantum Computer Architecture (LSQCA), which can achieve almost 100% memory density. The idea behind our architecture is to separate all memory regions into small computational space called Computational Registers (CR) and space-efficient memory space called Scan-Access Memory (SAM). We define an instruction set for these abstract structures and provide concrete designs named point-SAM and line-SAM architectures. With this design, we can improve the memory density by allowing variable-latency memory access while concealing the latency with other bottlenecks. We also propose optimization techniques to exploit properties of quantum programs observed in our static analysis, such as access locality in memory reference timestamps. Our numerical results indicate that LSQCA successfully leverages this idea. In a resource-restricted situation, a specific benchmark shows that we can achieve about 90% memory density with 5% increase in the execution time compared to a conventional floorplan, which achieves at most 50% memory density for unit-time random access. Our design ensures broad quantum applicability.</p>

            <p>The limited qubit connectivity of quantum processors poses a significant challenge in deploying practical algorithms and logical gates, necessitating efficient qubit mapping and routing strategies. When implementing a gate that requires additional connectivity beyond the native connectivity, the qubit state must be moved to a nearby connected qubit to execute the desired gate locally. This is typically achieved using a series of SWAP gates creating a SWAP path. However, routing methods relying on SWAP gates often lead to increased circuit depth and gate count, motivating the need for alternative approaches. This work explores the potential of teleported gates to improve qubit routing efficiency, focusing on implementation within specific hardware topologies and benchmark quantum algorithms. We propose a routing method that is assisted by gate teleportation. It establishes additional connectivity using gate teleportation paths through available unused qubits, termed auxiliary qubits, within the topology. To optimize this approach, we have developed an algorithm to identify the best gate teleportation connections, considering their potential to reduce the depth of the circuit and address possible errors that may arise from the teleportation paths. Finally, we demonstrate depth reduction with gate teleportation-assisted routing in various benchmark algorithms, including case studies on the compilation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for heavy-hexagon topology used in IBM 127-qubit Eagle r3 processors. Our benchmark results show a 10-25 $\%$ depth reduction in the routing of selected algorithms compared to regular routing without using the teleported gate.</p>

            <p>The tight frames can be regarded as a particular case of POVMs (positive operator-valued measures describing generalized measurements), namely the case when all the operators are rank-one. Each orthonormal basis is a tight frame, and every tight frame, after the embedding into a higher-dimensional space, is the orthogonal projection of an orthonormal basis. There exist several POVM-based definitions of coherence, and they are well-investigated. Our aim is to identify properties specific to the particular case of tight frames, and to look for some applications. All the POVM-based definitions use a Naimark extension. The frame-dependent coherence can be regarded as a particular case of POVM-based coherence, but it can be defined directly, without to use a Naimark extension. Its definition is a direct generalization of the basis-dependent $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, and it offers a more accurate description because we can use a frame containing several orthogonal bases. A frame-invariant definition of coherence for qubits and multi-qubit systems is presented.</p>

            <p>The viability of adiabatic quantum computation depends on the slow evolution of the Hamiltonian. The adiabatic switching theorem provides an asymptotic series for error estimates in $1/T$, based on the lowest non-zero derivative of the Hamiltonian and its eigenvalues at the endpoints. Modifications at the endpoints in practical implementations can modify this scaling behavior, suggesting opportunities for error reduction by altering endpoint behavior while keeping intermediate evolution largely unchanged. Such modifications can significantly reduce errors for long evolution times, but they may also require exceedingly long timescales to reach the hyperadiabatic regime, limiting their practicality. This paper explores the transition between the adiabatic and hyperadiabatic regimes in simple low-dimensional Hamiltonians, highlighting the impact of modifications of the endpoints on approaching the asymptotic behavior described by the switching theorem.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasil Rokaj, Ilia Tutunnikov, H. R. Sadeghpour</p>
            <p>Recent advances in polaritonic chemistry suggest that chemical reactions can be controlled via collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in a cavity. In this fully analytical work, we demonstrate that the collective vibrations of a molecular ensemble under VSC execute a beating with a period inversely proportional to the collective vacuum Rabi splitting. Significantly, this collective beating is imprinted on the local dynamics and resonantly suppresses individual molecular vibrations when a fraction of molecules are vibrationally excited, as in activated complexes formed in chemical reactions. This emergent beating occurs on significantly longer time scales than the individual molecular vibration or the cavity field oscillation period, peaking at the cavity-molecule resonance, consistent with polaritonic chemistry experiments. The cavity mediates an energy exchange between excited and ground-state molecules, affecting the dynamics of the entire ensemble. These findings suggest that the dynamics in polaritonic chemical reactions may not be in full equilibrium. In the ultra-strong coupling regime, we find that the local vibrations are modified by the cavity even at short time scales. Our analytical model offers insights into how collective VSC can dampen local molecular vibrations at resonance, potentially altering chemical reactivity.</p>

Using the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</p>

Franson interferometry confirms the global frequency correlations with visibility exceeding 98% and verifies the CV entanglement within individual frequency modes with visibility greater than 95%.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Hanotel, Elena R. Loubenets</p>
            <p>In the present paper, based on the general analytical expression [arXiv:2412.03470] for the maximum of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements in a two-qudit state of dimension $d=2s+1$, $s\geq 1/2$, we analyze whether or not, under spin-$1$ measurements in an arbitrary two-qutrit state, the CHSH inequality is violated. We find analytically for a variety of pure nonseparable two-qutrit states and also, numerically for $1,000,000$ randomly generated pure nonseparable two-qutrit states, that, under local Alice and Bob spin-$1$ measurements in each of these nonseparable states, including maximally entangled, the CHSH inequality is not violated. These results together with the spectral decomposition of a mixed state lead us to the Conjecture that, under local Alice and Bob spin-$1$ measurements, every nonseparable two-qutrit state, pure or mixed, does not violate the CHSH inequality. For a variety of pure two-qutrit states, we further find the values of their concurrence and compare them with the values of their spin-$1$ CHSH parameter, which determines violation or nonviolation by a two-qutrit state of the CHSH inequality under spin-$1$ measurements. This comparison indicates that, in contrast to spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements, where the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ CHSH parameter of a pure two-qubit state is increasing monotonically with a growth of its entanglement, for a pure two-qutrit state, this is not the case. In particular, for the two-qutrit GHZ state, which is maximally entangled, the spin-$1$ CHSH parameter is equal to $\sqrt{\frac{8}{9}}$, while, for some separable pure two-qutrit states, this parameter can be equal to unity. Moreover, for the two-qutrit Horodecki state, the spin-$1$ CHSH parameter is equal to $4\sqrt{2}/21<1$ regardless of the entanglement type of this mixed state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youwei Zhang, Shenchao Jin, Junlei Duan, Klaus Mølmer, Guiying Zhang, Mingfeng Wang, Yanhong Xiao</p>
            <p>Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</p>

            <p>We describe and analyze LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding), a framework for block-encoding second-quantized ladder operators that act upon fermionic and bosonic modes. We numerically benchmark these constructions using models arising in quantum field theories including the quartic oscillator, and $\phi^4$ and Yukawa Hamiltonians on the light front. These benchmarks show that LOBE produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for various second-quantized operators as compared to block-encoding frameworks that expand the ladder operators in the Pauli basis. The LOBE constructions also demonstrate favorable scaling with respect to key parameters, including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, the total number of fermionic and bosonic modes, and the locality of the operators. LOBE is implemented as an open source python package to enable further applications.</p>

            <p>The solution of large sparse linear systems via factorization methods such as LU or Cholesky decomposition, can be computationally expensive due to the introduction of non-zero elements, or ``fill-in.'' Graph partitioning can be used to reduce the ``fill-in,'' thereby speeding up the solution of the linear system. We introduce a quantum approach to the graph partitioning problem based on variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE). We develop a hybrid quantum/classical method to accelerate Finite Element Analysis (FEA) by using VarQITE in Ansys's LS-DYNA multiphysics simulation software. This allows us to study different types of FEA problems, from mechanical engineering to computational fluid dynamics in simulations and on quantum hardware (IonQ Aria and IonQ Forte). We demonstrate that VarQITE has the potential to impact LS-DYNA workflows by measuring the wall-clock time to solution of FEA problems. We report performance results for our hybrid quantum/classical workflow on selected FEA problem instances, including simulation of blood pumps, automotive roof crush, and vibration analysis of car bodies on meshes of up to six million elements. We find that the LS-DYNA wall clock time can be improved by up to 12\% for some problems. Finally, we introduce a classical heuristic inspired by Fiduccia-Mattheyses to improve the quality of VarQITE solutions obtained from hardware runs. Our results highlight the potential impact of quantum computing on large-scale FEA problems in the NISQ era.</p>

            <p>Coherent storage and retrieval of single photons in a quantum memory enables scalable growth of photonic entangled states via linear optics. The resulting increase in power of photonic quantum computers will unlock new applications on the pathway to fault tolerance. Quantum memories based on off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA) in rubidium vapour allow this storage to be broadband, noise-free, and high efficiency. Through algorithmic pulse-shape optimisation, we have previously demonstrated single-pass memory efficiency of almost 90\%. Here, we implement a cavity-enhanced GHz-bandwidth ORCA memory with smaller footprint and reduced power requirements compared to conventional single-pass schemes. By combining a strong magnetic field with polarisation control, we maintain a Doppler-free two-photon interaction and eliminate the need for optical pumping. The performance provided by the cavity establishes the feasibility of large arrays of ultra-compact, high-efficiency, room-temperature quantum memories, while the low control power requirements highlight a route to single-photon-level nonlinearities.</p>

            <p>We investigate the use of driven qubits coupled to a harmonic oscillator to implement a $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$-gate. By dressing the qubits through an external driving field, the qubits and the harmonic oscillator can be selectively coupled, leading to effective qubit-qubit interactions. We analyze a qubit readout mechanism based on the detection of a shift of the harmonic oscillator's resonance frequency, and demonstrate that when coupled to low-frequency resonators, dressed qubits provide a more robust readout than bare qubits in the presence of damping and thermal effects. Furthermore, we study the impact of various system parameters on the fidelity of the two-qubit gate, identifying an optimal range for quantum computation. Our findings guide the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates in experimental setups, for example those employing nanoscale mechanical resonators.</p>

            <p>The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Murauer, Rajiv Krishnakumar, Sabine Tornow, Michaela Geierhos</p>
            <p>Existing approaches to quantum reservoir computing can be broadly categorized into restart-based and continuous protocols. Restart-based methods require reinitializing the quantum circuit for each time step, while continuous protocols use mid-circuit measurements to enable uninterrupted information processing. A gap exists between these two paradigms: while restart-based methods naturally have high execution times due to the need for circuit reinitialization, they can employ novel feedback connections to enhance performance. In contrast, continuous methods have significantly faster execution times but typically lack such feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme that integrates feedback connections, which can operate within the coherence time of a qubit. We demonstrate our architecture using a minimal example and evaluate memory capacity and predictive capabilities. We show that the correlation coefficient for the short-term memory task on past inputs is nonzero, indicating that feedback connections can effectively operate during continuous processing to allow the model to remember past inputs.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Fan, Can Yin, Antonio M. García-García</p>
            <p>For one-dimensional free Dirac fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after the saturation time, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurement protocols. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength supporting that in all cases the EE is in the area law phase. Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial inhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems defining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, the distribution is Gaussian for weak monitoring. As the monitoring strength increases, it gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. In the strong monitoring limit, the tails are still exponential but the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect. For all monitoring strengths, the distribution is size independent.</p>

            <p>Practical distributed quantum computing and error correction require high-qubit-rate, high-fidelity, and low-reconfiguration-latency quantum networks between heterogeneous quantum information processors. Unfortunately, in a quantum network with homogeneous quantum processors, the theoretical entanglement distribution rate for a single channel is limited to the 100-kHz level with a millisecond-level reconfiguration latency, which is not sufficient for error-corrected distributed quantum computing. Here, we propose a quantum network architecture by introducing the concept of a reconfigurable quantum interface. In our protocol, through tuning the frequency and temporal mode of the photonic qubits to dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) channels, a 4.5 MHz Bell pair distribution rate, with a potential of more than 40 MHz Bell pair rate, is achieved. Through the use of reconfigurable quantum interfaces and wavelength-selective switches, a nanosecond network reconfiguration latency can be demonstrated with low-loss, low-infidelity and high-dimensional switches. To the best of our knowledge, our architecture is the first practical solution that can accommodate the entanglement distribution between heterogeneous quantum nodes with a rate and latency that satisfy most distributed quantum circuits and error correction requirements. The proposed architecture is compatible with the industry-standard DWDM infrastructure, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for distributed quantum computing.</p>

            <p>This study investigates spin squeezed states in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quadrupolar systems with spins $I=3/2$ and $I=7/2$ at room temperature, taking into account the effects of relaxation on the dynamics. The origin of spin squeezing is attributed to the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric field gradients in the molecular environment. The formal description of the nonlinear operators responsible for spin squeezing is achieved using the spin angular momentum representation via the one-axis twisting mechanism. This approach provides a framework for quantum control and metrology over the spin squeezing process while accounting for the influence of relaxation phenomena. Non-Cartesian angular momentum operators are proposed, with their variances products catching the quantum effects during the dynamics. An upper bound for the squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at thermal equilibrium are also predicted for any spin quantum number.</p>

            <p>This work explores structured matrix sequences arising in mean-field quantum spin systems. We express these sequences within the framework of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) $*$-algebras, leveraging the fact that each GLT matrix sequence has a unique GLT symbol.

Specifically, we analyze two cases of real symmetric matrix sequences stemming from mean-field quantum spin systems and determine their associated distributions using GLT theory. Our study concludes with visualizations and numerical tests that validate the theoretical findings, followed by a discussion of open problems and future directions.</p>

            <p>Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fang-Fang Du, Ling-Hui Li, Qiu-Lin Tan, Zhuo-Ya Bai</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement systems based on qudits dilate high-dimensional (HD) state spaces and enhance resistance to loss in quantum information processing (QIP). To fully exploit this potential, effective schemes for generating HD entanglement are crucial. In this paper, we propose a flexible heralded scheme generating random 4D two-qudit maximal entanglement for hybrid photon-emitter system by entering different input ports. This approach can be further extended to prepare 4D n-qudit (n is greater than or equal 3) maximal entanglement utilizing the 4D single-qudit Z^m (m=1,2,3) gate for the first qudit and X^m gate for the other qudits (except the second qudit). For the hybrid system, the first 4D qudit is encoded on the hybrid polarization-path states of a flying photon, while the second and subsequent 4D qudits are represented by two stationary emitters coupled to respective 1D waveguide. The qudit-encoded hybrid HD entanglement offers advantages over economizing quantum resource without any auxiliary qudits, and obtaining robust fidelities of various HD entanglement by the error-detected mechanism of the emitter-waveguide systems. Moreover, the proposed protocol can be spread to generate dD n-qudit (d is greater than or equal 2^(p+1), n, p=2,3,...) entangled states, further broadening its applicability in HD QIP.</p>

            <p>High-frequency mechanical oscillators with long coherence times are essential to realizing a variety of high-fidelity quantum sensors, transducers, and memories. However, the unprecedented coherence times needed for quantum applications require exquisitely sensitive new techniques to probe the material origins of phonon decoherence and new strategies to mitigate decoherence in mechanical oscillators. Here, we combine non-invasive laser spectroscopy techniques with materials analysis to identify key sources of phonon decoherence in crystalline media. Using micro-fabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators ($\mu$HBARs) as an experimental testbed, we identify phonon-surface interactions as the dominant source of phonon decoherence in crystalline quartz; lattice distortion, subsurface damage, and high concentration of elemental impurities near the crystal surface are identified as the likely causes. Removal of this compromised surface layer using an optimized polishing process is seen to greatly enhance coherence times, enabling $\mu$HBARs with Q-factors of > 240 million at 12 GHz frequencies, corresponding to > 6 ms phonon coherence times and record-level f-Q products. Complementary phonon linewidth and time-domain ringdown measurements, performed using a new Brillouin-based pump-probe spectroscopy technique, reveal negligible dephasing within these oscillators. Building on these results, we identify a path to > 100 ms coherence times as the basis for high-frequency quantum memories. These findings clearly demonstrate that, with enhanced control over surfaces, dissipation and noise can be significantly reduced in a wide range of quantum systems.</p>

In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems.

            <p>We discuss the holographic description of Narain $U(1)^c\times U(1)^c$ conformal field theories, and their potential similarity to conventional weakly coupled gravity in the bulk, in the sense that the effective IR bulk description includes "$U(1)$ gravity" amended with additional light degrees of freedom. Starting from this picture, we formulate the hypothesis that in the large central charge limit the density of states of any Narain theory is bounded by below by the density of states of $U(1)$ gravity. This immediately implies that the maximal value of the spectral gap for primary fields is $\Delta_1=c/(2\pi e)$. To test the self-consistency of this proposal, we study its implications using chiral lattice CFTs and CFTs based on quantum stabilizer codes. First we notice that the conjecture yields a new bound on quantum stabilizer codes, which is compatible with previously known bounds in the literature. We proceed to discuss the variance of the density of states, which for consistency must be vanishingly small in the large-$c$ limit. We consider ensembles of code and chiral theories and show that in both cases the density variance is exponentially small in the central charge.</p>

            <p>We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Discontinuous Quantum Phase Transition in a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew T. Wheeler, Hayder Salman, Magnus O. Borgh</p>
            <p>Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We demonstrate the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for this transition to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.</p>

            <p>We consider a random quantum channel obtained by taking a selection of $d$ independent and Haar distributed $N$ dimensional unitaries. We follow the argument of Hastings to bound the spectral gap in terms of eigenvalues and adapt it to give an exact estimate of the spectral gap in terms of singular values \cite{hastings2007random,harrow2007quantum}. This shows that we have constructed a random quantum expander in terms of both singular values and eigenvalues. The lower bound is an analog of the Alon-Boppana bound for $d$-regular graphs.

This framework is applicable to a broad range of quantum systems with arbitrary lattice geometries, including cold atoms, solid-state photonics, and superconducting platforms. The model can be used, for example, to scalably design quantum optical elements, e.g. a quantum lens, harnessing atomistic engineering (e.g. via ion implantation) of collective interactions in materials to enhance quantum properties at scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Bayona-Pena, Ryo Hanai, Takashi Mori, Hisao Hayakawa</p>
            <p>It has recently been established that open quantum systems may exhibit a strong spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the non-Hermitian/Liouvillian skin effect (NHSE/LSE), making the topological properties of the system boundary-condition sensitive. In this Letter, we ask the query: Can topological phase transitions of open quantum systems, captured by open boundary conditioned invariants, be observed in the dynamics of a system in a periodic boundary condition, even in the presence of NHSE/LSE? We affirmatively respond to this question, by considering the quench dynamics of entanglement spectrum in a periodic open quantum fermionic system. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum exhibits zero-crossings only when this periodic system is quenched from a topologically trivial to non-trivial phase, defined from the spectrum in open boundary conditions, even in systems featuring LSE. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian topological phases leave a distinctive imprint on the unconditional dynamics within a subsystem of fermionic systems.</p>

            <h2>Finite Correlation Length Scaling of Disorder Parameter at Quantum Criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Tao Xu, Rui-Zhen Huang</p>
            <p>The disorder parameter, defined as the expectation value of the symmetry transformation acting on a subsystem, can be used to characterize symmetric phases as an analogy to detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases using local order parameters. In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite correlation length scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite correlation length scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., it decays exponentially with the boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.</p>

            <h2>Regularized stress tensor of vector fields in de Sitter space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhang, Xuan Ye</p>
            <p>We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Bipartite Relativistic Quantum Information from Effective Field Theory Approach with Implications to Contextual Meanings of Locality and Quantumness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Li Lin, Sayid Mondal</p>
            <p>In a recent work \cite{biggs2024comparing}, the effective field theory (EFT) is adopted to consider the quantum decoherence of a near-horizon Unrhu-DeWitt (UDW) charged qubit in a macroscopic cat state. We generalize this EFT approach to study the relativistic quantum information (RQI) of two static UDW-charged qubits with or without a black hole. This EFT is obtained by integrating out a massless mediator field, yielding the direct Coulombic interactions among intrinsic multipole moments of UDW detectors and the induced one on the black hole. The RQI of the quantum state of the mediator field can be probed by the reduced final states of UDW detectors by tracing out the induced internal states of the black hole. From the reduced final state, we find the patterns of entanglement harvesting agree with the ones obtained by the conventional approach based on master theory. However, the more detailed study suggests that the contextual meanings of (non-)locality may or may not be the same in quantum field theory (QFT) and RQI. To explore the contextual meanings of quantumness and locality more, we also calculate quantum discord and locality bound of the Bell-type experiments, with the former characterizing the non-classical correlations and the latter the (non-)locality in the hidden-variable context of RQI. We find that QFT and RQI agree on quantumness based on different physical reasons but may not agree on locality.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose--Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell--Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.</p>

Furthermore, this entanglement can be directly measured in an experiment using time-of-flight techniques. To prototype our method, we numerically study entanglement generation in a degenerate Bose gas following a quench to the unitary regime, where Gaussian and non-Gaussian correlations are generated sequentially in time.</p>

            <h2>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Hokkyo</p>
            <p>The integrability of a quantum many-body system, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for determining integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of nonintegrability, such as those for the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with nearest-and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic chain and the $S=1/2$ XYZ model in two or higher dimensions. Moreover, our results also yield the first proof of nonintegrability for models such as the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with a non-uniform magnetic field, the $S=1/2$ XYZ model on the triangular lattice, and the general spin XYZ model. This work also offers a partial resolution to the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the existence of local conserved quantities with small support. Our framework ensures that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be verified algorithmically, independently of system size.</p>

            <p>The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincaré AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</p>

            <p>The field of programmable photonics has advanced significantly in recent decades, driven by the rising demand for complex applications, such as optical quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, as the complexity of these applications increases, there is an increasing need for novel designs that enhance circuit transmission and enable further miniaturization. Photonic waveguide arrays (WAs) hold a unique position in integrated photonics, as they implement ``always-on'' Hamiltonians and have no direct analogs in free-space optics. They find applications in various fields, including light propagation studies, quantum walks, and topological photonics. Despite their versatility, the lack of reconfigurability has limited their utility and hindered further advancements for a long time. Recently, programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs) have emerged as a promising solution for overcoming the limitations of static WAs and PWA-based architectures have been proven to be universal. This perspective proposes a vision for photonic circuits based on PWAs as a new, interdisciplinary field. We review the history of the development of PWAs and outline their potential in areas such as simulation, communication, sensing, and classical and quantum information processing. This technology is expected to become increasingly feasible with advancements in programmable photonics, nanofabrication, and quantum control.</p>

            <p>Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) provide a platform for probing the quantum nature of mechanical motion in mesoscopic systems. This nature manifests most profoundly when the device vibrations are nonlinear and, currently, achieving vibrational nonlinearity at the single-phonon level is an active area of pursuit in quantum information science. Despite much effort, however, this has remained elusive. Here, we report the first observation of intrinsic mesoscopic vibrational dressed states. The requisite nonlinearity results from strong resonant coupling between an eigenmode of our NEMS resonator and a single, two-level system (TLS) that is intrinsic to the device material. We control the TLS in situ by varying mechanical strain, tuning it in and out of resonance with the NEMS mode. Varying the resonant drive and/or temperature allows controlled ascent of the nonequidistant energy ladder and reveals the energy multiplets of the hybridized system. Fluctuations of the TLS on and off resonance with the mode induces switching between dressed and bare states; this elucidates the complex quantum nature of TLS-like defects in mesoscopic systems. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from the intrinsic material properties of mechanical systems - without need for complex, external quantum circuits. Our work provides long-sought insight into mesoscopic dynamics and offers a new direction to harness nanomechanics for quantum measurements.</p>

            <p>Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</p>

In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate.

            <p>Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</p>

In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</p>

            <p>The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</p>

            <p>By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.</p>

We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formulæ for the intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one.</p>

To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</p>

            <h2>Unifying adiabatic state-transfer protocols with $(α, β)$-hypergeometries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Ventura Meinersen, David Fernandez-Fernandez, Gloria Platero, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ</p>
            <p>Adiabatic optimal control schemes are essential for advancing the practical implementation of quantum technologies. However, the vast array of possible adiabatic protocols, combined with their dependence on the particular quantum system and function-specific parameter ranges, complicates the task of discerning their respective strengths and limitations in arbitrary operations. In this work, we provide a unifying framework, called $(\alpha,\beta)$-hypergeometries, that allows for flexible, noise-resistant, and easy-to-use implementation of enforced adiabatic dynamics for any multi-level quantum system. Moreover, this framework provides a comprehensive mapping of all adiabatic protocols through a universal cost function and offers an exact analytical characterization of the adiabatic dynamics. In particular, we derive precise expressions for infidelity resonances and establish performance guarantees in the adiabatic limit for any choice of $(\alpha,\beta)$. We also discuss in detail the experimental feasibility of the resulting pulse shapes through analytical and numerical methods. Finally, we test our method for the optimal control of coherent information transfer through spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots with small valley splittings.</p>

            <h2>Higher order tensor factorizations for block encoding vibrational and vibronic Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirsh Kamakari, Emil Zak</p>
            <p>Fault tolerant quantum simulation via the phase estimation algorithm and qubitization has a T-gate count that scales proportionally to the 1-norm of the Hamiltonian, the cost of block encoding the Hamiltonian, and inversely proportionally to the desired accuracy. Tensor factorization methods have been successfully used to reduce T-gate counts in the ground state electronic structure problem. Here we introduce the use of tensor factorization methods to reduce the T-gate count of quantum phase estimation. In particular, we show how Canonical Polyadic and Tucker decompositions of the tensors representing the vibrational and vibronic Hamiltonians can be utilized to rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of linear combination of bosonic position operators representing nuclear vibrations. We demonstrate the use of these factorization methods on the water and monodeutered methane molecules.</p>

            <h2>Testing bath correlation functions for open quantum dynamics simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaaki Tokieda</p>
            <p>Accurate simulations of thermalization in open quantum systems require a reliable representation of the bath correlation function (BCF). Numerical approaches, such as the hierarchical equations of motion and the pseudomode method, inherently approximate the BCF using a finite set of functions, which can impact simulation accuracy. In this work, we propose a practical and rigorous testing framework to assess the validity of approximate BCFs in open quantum dynamics simulations. Our approach employs a harmonic oscillator system, where the dynamics can be benchmarked against known exact solutions. To enable practical testing, we make two key methodological advancements. First, we develop numerical techniques to evaluate these exact solutions efficiently across a wide range of BCFs for broad applicability. Second, we introduce a moment-based state representation that significantly simplifies computations by exploiting the Gaussian nature of the system. Application to a two-spin system demonstrates that our testing procedure yields reliable error estimates for thermalization simulations. Using this methodology, we assess the performance of recently proposed BCF construction methods, highlighting both their strengths and a notable challenge posed by sub-Ohmic spectral densities at finite temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Efficient measurement of neutral-atom qubits with matched filters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert M. Kent, Linipun Phuttitarn, Chaithanya Naik Mude, Swamit Tannu, Mark Saffman, Gregory Lafyatis, Daniel J. Gauthier</p>
            <p>Quantum computers require high-fidelity measurement of many qubits to achieve a quantum advantage. Traditional approaches suffer from readout crosstalk for a neutral-atom quantum processor with a tightly spaced array. Although classical machine learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can improve fidelity, they are computationally expensive, making it difficult to scale them to large qubit counts. We present two simpler and scalable machine learning algorithms that realize matched filters for the readout problem. One is a local model that focuses on a single qubit, and the other uses information from neighboring qubits in the array to prevent crosstalk among the qubits. We demonstrate error reductions of up to 32% and 43% for the site and array models, respectively, compared to a conventional Gaussian threshold approach. Additionally, our array model uses two orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and four orders of magnitude fewer multiplications and nonlinear function evaluations than a recent convolutional neural network approach, with only a minor (3.5%) increase in error across different readout times. Another strength of our approach is its physical interpretability: the learned filter can be visualized to provide insights into experimental imperfections. We also show that a convolutional neural network model for improved can be pruned to have 70x and 4000x fewer parameters, respectively, while maintaining similar errors. Our work shows that simple machine learning approaches can achieve high-fidelity qubit measurements while remaining scalable to systems with larger qubit counts.</p>

            <h2>CDJ-Pontryagin Optimal Control for General Continuously Monitored Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tathagata Karmakar, Andrew N. Jordan</p>
            <p>The Chantasri-Dressel-Jordan (CDJ) stochastic path integral formalism (Chantasri et al. 2013 and 2015) characterizes the statistics of the readouts and the most likely conditional evolution of a continuously monitored quantum system. In our work, we generalize the CDJ formalism to arbitrary continuously monitored systems by introducing a costate operator. We then prescribe a generalized Pontryagin's maximum principle for quantum systems undergoing arbitrary evolution and find conditions on optimal control protocols. We show that the CDJ formalism's most likely path can be cast as a quantum Pontryagin's maximum principle, where the cost function is the readout probabilities along a quantum trajectory. This insight allows us to derive a general optimal control equations for arbitrary control parameters to achieve a given task. We apply our results to a monitored oscillator in the presence of a parametric quadratic potential and variable quadrature measurements. We find the optimal potential strength and quadrature angle for fixed-end point problems. The optimal parametric potential is analytically shown to have a "bang-bang" form. We apply our protocol to three quantum oscillator examples relevant to Bosonic quantum computing. The first example considers a binomial codeword preparation from an error word, the second looks into cooling to the ground state from an even cat state, and the third investigates a cat state to cat state evolution. We compare the statistics of the fidelities of the final state with respect to the target state for trajectories generated under the optimal control with those generated under a sample control. Compared to the latter case, we see a 40-196% increase in the number of trajectories reaching more than 95% fidelities under the optimal control. Our work provides a systematic prescription for finding quantum optimal control for continuously monitored systems.</p>

            <h2>Downloading many-qubit entanglement from continuous-variable cluster states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihua Han, Hoi-Kwan Lau</p>
            <p>Many-body entanglement is an essential resource for many quantum technologies, but its scalable generation has been challenging on qubit platforms. However, the generation of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement can be extremely efficient, but its utility is rather limited. In this work, we propose a scheme to combine the best of both qubit and CV approaches: a systematic method to download useful many-qubit entanglement from the efficiently generated CV cluster states. Our protocol is based on one-bit teleportation of the qubit correlation encoded in the displaced Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill basis. To characterize the practical performance of our scheme, we develop an equivalent circuit to map dominant CV errors to single-qubit preparation errors. Particularly, we relate finite squeezing error to qubit erasure, and show that only 5.4 dB squeezing is sufficient to implement robust qubit memory or quantum computation (QC), and 11.9 dB for fault-tolerant QC. Our protocol can be implemented with the operations that are common in many bosonic platforms.</p>

            <h2>Scalable universal quantum gates between nitrogen-vacancy centers in levitated nanodiamonds arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyu Zhang, Huaijin Zhang, Zhang-qi Yin</p>
            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamond offer a promising platform for quantum information processing due to their room-temperature spin coherence and optical addressability. However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99\%. This work provides a foundation for reconfigurable quantum hybrid systems, with potential applications in rotational sensing and programmable quantum processing.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive study of the rational extension of the quantum anisotropic harmonic oscillator (QAHO) potentials with linear and/or quadratic perturbations. For the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator plus imaginary linear perturbation ($i\lambda x$), we show that the rational extension is possible not only for the even but also for the odd co-dimensions $m$. In two-dimensional case, we construct the rational extensions for QAHO potentials with quadratic ($\lambda \, xy$) perturbation both when $\lambda$ is real or imaginary and obtain their solutions. Finally, we extend the discussion to the three-dimensional QAHO with linear and quadratic perturbations and obtain the corresponding rationally extended potentials. For all these cases, we obtain the conditions under which the spectrum remains real and also when there is degeneracy in the system.</p>

            <h2>Manifestation of critical effects in environmental parameter estimation using a quantum sensor under dynamical control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Cristina Rodriguez, Analia Zwick, Gonzalo A. Alvarez</p>
            <p>Quantum probes offer a powerful platform for exploring environmental dynamics, particularly through their sensitivity to decoherence processes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of critical behavior in the estimation of the environmental memory time $\tau_c$, modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Using dynamically controlled qubit-based sensors -- realized experimentally via solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and supported by numerical simulations -- we implement tailored filter functions to interrogate the environmental noise spectrum and extract $\tau_c$ from its spectral width. Our results reveal a sharp transition in estimation performance between short-memory (SM) and long-memory (LM) regimes, reflected in a non-monotonic estimation error that resembles a phase transition. This behavior is accompanied by an avoided-crossing-like structure in the estimated parameter space, indicative of two competing solutions near the critical point. These features underscore the interplay between control, decoherence, and inference in open quantum systems. Beyond their fundamental significance, these critical phenomena offer a practical diagnostic tool for identifying dynamical regimes and optimizing quantum sensing protocols. By exploiting this criticality, our findings pave the way for adaptive control strategies aimed at enhancing precision in quantum parameter estimation -- particularly in complex or structured environments such as spin networks, diffusive media, and quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Unathi Skosana, Sthembiso Gumede, Mark Tame</p>
            <p>We present numerical calculations of the energetic separation between different spin states (singlet, triplet and quintet) for a simplified model of a deoxy-myoglobin protein using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The goal is to gain insight into the workflow and challenges of VQE simulations for transition metal complexes, with emphasis on methodology over hardware-specific implementation. The numerical calculations are performed using an in-house statevector simulator with single- and multi-reference trial wavefunctions based on the k-unitary pair coupled-cluster generalized singles and doubles or k-UpCCGSD ansatz. The spin-state energetics for active spaces of increasing size up to 10 spatial orbitals (20 spin orbitals or qubits) are computed with VQE and were found to agree with the classical complete active self-consistent field or CASSCF method to within 1-4 kcal/mol. We evaluate relevant multi-reference diagnostics and show that the spin states computed with VQE possess a sufficient degree of multi-reference character to highlight the presence of strong electron correlation effects. Our numerical simulations show that in the ideal case, the VQE algorithm is capable of reproducing spin-state energetics of strongly correlated systems such as transition metal complexes for both single- and multi-reference trial wavefunctions, asymptotically achieving good agreement with results from classical methods as the number of active orbitals increases.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Atom in a Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.I. Mazhari, Rituraj</p>
            <p>Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant cavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the cavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical solution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also predicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be approximately $0.1\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions between the manifolds of the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Chakrabarti, S.V. Iyengar, B.V. Jenisha</p>
            <p>We investigate generation of nonclassical photon states via conditional measurement process in a two mode coupled waveguide. Interaction of the fields takes place in a waveguide beamsplitter due to the overlap between normal modes supported therein. A quadratic Hamiltonian of two degrees of freedom describes the hopping interaction. An initial two mode squeezed state undergoes a unitary evolution governed by the interaction Hamiltonian for a specified time. Following this the bipartite state is subjected to a projective measurement that detects $n$-th Fock state in one subsystem. The post-measurement excitation rendered in the residual subsystem depends on the prior time of interaction between the modes as well as the interaction strength. The Wigner quasiprobability distribution of an arbitrary post-selection state is computed. Its nonclassicality is examined via the negativity of the Wigner distribution. The sub-Poissonian nature of the photon statistics is revealed by the Mandel parameter. The dynamically generated squeezing is evidenced in the post-measurement state. In the ultrastrong coupling regime the parity even and odd states display markedly \textit{different} nonclassical properties. The nonclassicality of the post-measurement states obtained here may be \textit{controlled} by varying the interaction strength and the time span of interaction between the modes.</p>

            <p>We solve the Lindblad master equation for the quantum state of a pumped optomechanical system coupled to a thermal bath. We show that when the microwave pump field frequency is on the red sideband of the cavity resonance, the exact form of the state is a beam-split thermal state, and when it is on the blue sideband, it is a two-mode squeezed thermal state. These solutions allow us to determine the mechanical cooling and the entanglement between the microwave and mechanical modes. We find that we can entangle the modes in a thermal environment by activating the two fields sequentially. In this scheme, after cooling the mechanical mode via the red sideband pump, we determine the optimal blue sideband pump field to achieve the maximum entanglement time and the maximum time below a desired correlation variance threshold as a function of the loss rates and equilibrium temperatures of the two modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Gerard R. Sevilla, Jayson G. Cosme</p>
            <p>The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW) phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities, which may hint at an eventual transition to a Mott insulating (MI) phase.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical study of a mesoscopic two-dimensional electron gas confined in a double quantum well that is coupled to a uniform quasi-static cavity mode via fluctuations of the dipole moment. We focus on the regime of large number of electrons participating in the virtual inter-subband transitions. In this regime, the effective photonic potential is no longer quadratic but, instead, it contains large number of minima. Each minimum represents a nearly harmonic oscillator with the renormalized cavity frequency that is much greater than its bare value. The energy offset of a minimum scales quadratically with respect to the photon coordinate corresponding to this minimum. These energy offsets determine the statistical weight of each minimum, and altogether they result in the additive correction to the heat capacity of the system. This correction exhibits a Schottky anomaly and a 0.5k_B plateau at low temperatures. This behavior can be associated with the emergence of a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom does not manifest in the optical conductivity and can only be observed via the heat capacity measurement.</p>

            <p>Dysprosium atoms have proven to be a promising platform for quantum simulation due to their strong magnetic moment and high tunability of interactions. In this work, we propose Dysprosium atoms for simulating the one-dimensional spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg model, which is known to have a rich phase diagram including the famous Haldane phase. To realize the model, we make use of the strong dipolar exchange interactions that naturally occur in the ground state of Dysprosium due to its large electron angular momentum of J=8. To implement spin-1 particles, we encode the spin degree of freedom into three Zeeman sublevels, which are energetically isolated by applying a magnetic field. Using the density-matrix renormalization group, we analyze the ground-state properties of the resulting effective model. We find that a chain of fermionic Dysprosium atoms in a suitable magnetic field can form a Haldane state with the characteristic spin-1/2 edge modes. Furthermore, we discuss the use of AC Stark shifts and Raman-type schemes for bosonic Dysprosium to isolate effective spin-1 systems and to increase the tunability of model parameters.</p>

            <p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws within neural architectures. However, these classical approaches often require a large number of parameters to achieve reasonable accuracy, particularly for complex PDEs. In this paper, we present a quantum-classical physics-informed neural network (QCPINN) that combines quantum and classical components, allowing us to solve PDEs with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining comparable accuracy and convergence to classical PINNs. We systematically evaluated two quantum circuit architectures across various configurations on five benchmark PDEs to identify optimal QCPINN designs. Our results demonstrate that the QCPINN achieves stable convergence and comparable accuracy, while requiring approximately 10% of the trainable parameters used in classical approaches. It also results in a 40% reduction in the relative error L2 for the convection-diffusion equation. These findings demonstrate the potential of parameter efficiency as a measurable quantum advantage in physics-informed machine learning, significantly reducing model complexity while preserving solution quality. This approach presents a promising solution to the computational challenges associated with solving PDEs.</p>

Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</p>

            <h2>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Karamitros, Thomas McKelvey, Apostolos Pilaftsis</p>
            <p>We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</p>

            <p>We consider a 2D atomic array coupled to different photonic environments, focusing on the half-filled excitation subspace, where strong photon interactions can give rise to complex many-body states. In particular, we demonstrate that the least radiant state in this sector is well described by a coherent superposition of all possible quantum dimer coverings: a resonating valence bond (RVB) liquid state. We discuss possible strategies to probe this exotic state, along with their limitations and challenges. Finally, we show that such a quantum dimer covering can also emerge as the ground state of the coherent Hamiltonian describing a 2D atomic array coupled to a photonic band-gap material.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing promises transformative impacts in simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, essential for studying physical systems inaccessible by classical computing. However, existing compilation techniques for Hamiltonian simulation, in particular the commonly used Trotter formulas struggle to provide gate counts feasible on current quantum computers for beyond-classical simulations. We propose partial Trotterization, where sets of non-commuting Hamiltonian terms are directly compiled allowing for less error per Trotter step and therefore a reduction of Trotter steps overall. Furthermore, a suite of novel optimizations are introduced which complement the new partial Trotterization technique, including reinforcement learning for complex unitary decompositions and high level Hamiltonian analysis for unitary reduction. We demonstrate with numerical simulations across spin and fermionic Hamiltonians that compared to state of the art methods such as Qiskit's Rustiq and Qiskit's Paulievolutiongate, our novel compiler presents up to 10x gate and depth count reductions.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erin Sheridan, Michael Senatore, Samuel Schwab, Eric Aspling, Taylor Wagner, James Schneeloch, Stephen McCoy, Daniel Campbell, David Hucul, Zachary Smith, Matthew LaHaye</p>
            <p>Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Multi-Hop Quantum Communication using Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation Protocol</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. Ikken, P. Kumar, A. Slaoui, B. Kar, R. Ahl Laamara, M. Almousa, A. A Abd El-Latif</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a new method for Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation called Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation using the Modified Dijkstra Algorithm and Quantum Walk (BQT-MDQW). This method uses different types of entangled states, such as the GHZ-Bell state, W-Bell state, and Cluster-Bell state, to improve quantum communication in multi-hop quantum wireless networks. We focus on the W-Bell state and compare the quantum Dijkstra algorithm with the classical Dijkstra method to see which one works better. We apply both versions to quantum and classical simulators, measuring their performance through fidelity, memory utilization, and throughput calculations. Our results show that the shortest path problem may be solved with significantly reduced computer complexity using the quantum Dijkstra algorithm based on quantum walks. The introduction of a quantum walk, which permits dynamic transitions between quantum channels and the effective exploration of quantum network states, is an important part of the protocol. Using the capacity of the quantum walk to adjust to changing quantum states, we also introduce a method for successfully identifying unitary matrices under varying quantum channels. The bidirectional teleportation structure of the protocol is designed to solve the multi-hop teleportation problem in quantum wireless networks. In addition, we present quantum Dijkstra's algorithm, which uses quantum gates to significantly decrease computational complexity and solve the networking problem by building on the quantum walk framework. This method shows how quantum computing may be used to solve arbitrary optimization issues such as the shortest path problem. Finally, we present a novel multi-hop quantum teleportation system encompassing both unidirectional and bidirectional communication, as introduced in the quantum Dijkstra algorithm system...</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haimeng Zhao, Yuzhen Zhang, John Preskill</p>
            <p>The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</p>

            <p>Quantum memories for light are essential building blocks for quantum repeaters and quantum networks. Integrated operations of quantum memories could enable scalable application with low-power consumption. However, the photonic quantum storage lifetime in integrated optical waveguide has so far been limited to tens of microseconds, falling short of the requirements for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate quantum storage of photonic qubits for 1.021 ms based on a laser-written optical waveguide fabricated in a 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal. Spin dephasing of 151Eu3+ is mitigated through dynamical decoupling applied via on-chip electric waveguides and we obtain a storage efficiency of 12.0(0.5)% at 1.021 ms, which is a demonstration of integrated quantum memories that outperforms the efficiency of a simple fiber delay line. Such long-lived waveguide-based quantum memory could support applications in quantum repeaters, and further combination with critical magnetic fields could enable potential application as transportable quantum memories.</p>

            <h2>Heralded qudit-based high-dimensional entanglement generation for hybrid photon-emitter system by waveguide-mediated scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fang-Fang Du, Ling-Hui Li</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement systems based on qudits dilate high-dimensional (HD) state spaces and enhance resistance to loss in quantum information processing (QIP). To fully exploit this potential, effective schemes for generating HD entanglement are crucial. In this paper, we propose a flexible heralded scheme generating random 4D two-qudit maximal entanglement for hybrid photon-emitter system by entering different input ports. This approach can be further extended to prepare 4D n-qudit (n is greater than or equal 3) maximal entanglement utilizing the 4D single-qudit Z^m (m=1,2,3) gate for the first qudit and X^m gate for the other qudits (except the second qudit). For the hybrid system, the first 4D qudit is encoded on the hybrid polarization-path states of a flying photon, while the second and subsequent 4D qudits are represented by two stationary emitters coupled to respective 1D waveguide. The qudit-encoded hybrid HD entanglement offers advantages over economizing quantum resource without any auxiliary qudits, and obtaining robust fidelities of various HD entanglement by the error-detected mechanism of the emitter-waveguide systems. Moreover, the proposed protocol can be spread to generate dD n-qudit (d is greater than or equal 2^(p+1), n, p=2,3,...) entangled states, further broadening its applicability in HD QIP.</p>

            <p>To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the Helium (He) molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems.

            <h2>Rydberg Superatom Interface for Topological Microwave-to-Optical Photon Conversion in Fock-State Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Yao Song, Jin-Lei Wu, Weibin Li, Shi-Lei Su</p>
            <p>Microwave-to-optical conversion (MTOC) of single photons plays a pivotal role in bridging quantum devices across different frequency domains, but faces challenges in maintaining efficiency and robustness against fluctuations and dissipation in hybrid quantum systems. Here, we propose a topologically protected MTOC scheme mediated by a Rydberg superatom to address these limitations. By constructing cross-linked Fock-state lattices (FSLs) through a dual-mode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) architecture, we map the effective hybrid system onto an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger~(SSH) model with tunable hopping rates. Photon-number--dependent property of hopping rates triggers a topological phase transition in the extended SSH chain, converting the defect mode into a topological channel that directionally pumps photons between microwave and optical cavities. This mechanism leverages Rydberg blockade-enhanced photon-superatom couplings to establish a robust energy transfer channel, achieving high-efficiency photon conversion under realistic decoherence. Our theoretical framework demonstrates how topological protection synergizes with Rydberg-mediated light-matter interactions to realize a robust quantum transducer, providing a scalable platform for noise-resilient quantum networks and frequency-multiplexed quantum interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Ling Zhang, Yang Liu, Zhi-Kang Lin, Jian-Hua Jiang</p>
            <p>Topological lasers, known for their robustness and unique features originating from nontrivial topology, have recently become a focal point of research in photonics. In this work, we propose a topological laser based on two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattices as induced by artificial gauge flux insertion. The underlying effect, called the topological Wannier cycles, is characterized by topological local modes with continuously tunable frequency and orbital angular momentum emerging in two photonic band gaps. These topological local modes enable single-mode large-area lasing in each photonic band gap with both topological robustness and exceptional tunability in frequency and OAM properties, setting a notable contrast with previous topological lasers. We further discuss both localized and extended artificial gauge flux insertion and compare their properties. We find that extended gauge flux achieves significantly higher laser output intensity and larger single-mode area under laser-gain conditions, outperforming the local gauge flux configuration in both output intensity and resilience against disorders. We also elucidate the precise mechanisms by which nonlinear gain and gauge flux govern the photon dynamics in various regimes. These results provide crucial theoretical insights for OAM control in topological lasers and pave the way for advancements in high precision engineering of lasers and optical systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum transduction is essential for the future hybrid quantum networks, connecting devices across different spectral ranges. In this regard, molecular modulation in hollow-core fibers has proven to be exceptional for efficient and tunable frequency conversion of arbitrary light fields down to the single-photon limit. However, insights on this conversion method for quantum light have remained elusive beyond standard semiclassical models. In this Letter, we employ a quantum Hamiltonian framework to characterize the behavior of entanglement during molecular modulation, while describing the quantum dynamics of both molecules and photons in agreement with recent experiments. In particular, apart from obtaining analytical expressions for the final opto-molecular states, our model predicts a close correlation between the evolution of the average photon numbers and the transfer of entanglement between the interacting parties. These results will contribute to the development of new fiber-based strategies to tackle the challenges associated with the upcoming generation of lightwave quantum technologies.</p>

Logical life-time and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96 % for every cardinal logical state, find logical life-times above the best physical element, and logical error-per-cycle values ranging from from 0.25(2) % to 0.91(3) %.

Our results have broad applications in various directions. We demonstrate applications in quantum machine learning, where our protocol enables efficient training of variational quantum neural networks by directly learning unitary transformations. Additionally, it facilitates the prediction of quantum expectation values with provable efficiency and provides a robust framework for verifying quantum computations and benchmarking realistic noisy quantum hardware. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for practical quantum dynamics learning, paving the way for scalable quantum process characterization in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>

            <p>We show that a self-correcting GKP qubit can be realized with a high-impedance LC circuit coupled to a resistor and a Josephson junction via a controllable switch. When activating the switch in a particular stepwise pattern, the resonator relaxes into a subspace of GKP states that encode a protected qubit. Under continued operation, the resistor dissipatively error-corrects the qubit against bit flips and decoherence by absorbing noise-induced entropy. We show that this leads to an exponential enhancement of coherence time (T1 and T2), even in the presence of extrinsic noise, imperfect control, and device parameter variations. We show the qubit supports exponentially robust single-qubit Clifford gates, implemented via appropriate control of the switch, and readout/initialization via supercurrent measurement. The qubit's self-correcting properties allows it to operate at ~1K temperatures and resonator Q factors down to ~1000 for realistic parameters, and make it amenable to parallel control through global control signals. We discuss how the effects of quasiparticle poisoning -- potentially, though not necessarily, a limiting factor -- might be mitigated. We finally demonstrate that a related device supports a self-correcting magic T gate.</p>

            <p>Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic thermodynamics a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities, but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems.

The microwave cavity acts as a work agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics. Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference.

            <p>We present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of chemical systems on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, incorporating both electronic and nuclear quantum degrees of freedom. An all-particle simulation is nominally efficient on a quantum computer, but practically infeasible. Hence, central to our approach is the construction of a first-quantized plane-wave algorithm making use of pseudoions. The latter consolidate chemically inactive electrons and the nucleus into a single effective dynamical ionic entity, extending the well-established concept of pseudopotentials in quantum chemistry to a two-body interaction. We explicitly describe efficient quantum circuits for initial state preparation across all degrees of freedom, as well as for block-encoding the Hamiltonian describing interacting pseudoions and chemically active electrons, by leveraging recent advances in quantum rejection sampling to optimize the implementations. To extract useful chemical information, we first design molecular fingerprints by combining density-functional calculations with machine learning techniques, and subsequently validate them through surrogate classical molecular dynamics simulations. These fingerprints are then coherently encoded on a quantum computer for efficient molecular identification via amplitude estimation. We provide an extensive analysis of the cost of running the algorithm on a fault-tolerant quantum computer for several chemically interesting systems. As an illustration, simulating the interaction between $\mathrm{NH_3}$ and $\mathrm{BF_3}$ (a 40-particle system) requires 808 logical qubits to encode the problem, and approximately $10^{11}$ Toffoli gates per femtosecond of time evolution.

            <p>Cooling massive oscillators to quantum ground state is a key step for their precise control and quantum application. Recent work found that the center-of-mass motion of a levitated magnetic sphere can be cooled via magnon-cavity coupling. In this work, we demonstrate that a enhanced cooling can be realized by exploiting self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnon mode, observed in a ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere. By means of proper pump driving, the self-Kerr nonlinearity is mapped into degenerate magnon squeezing, leading to considerable enhancement of cooling via optimizing system parameters. Moreover, this Kerr nonlinear effect also brings enhanced cooling in the sideband-unresolved regime where the mechanical frequency is smaller than the cavity decay rate. These results provide new way to quantum technologies in terms of storage schemes and ultrasensitive measurements.</p>

            <p>Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of BEC and superfluidity at surprisingly high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum technologies, enabling advancements in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum precision measurement. Here, we propose a method to enhance optomechanical entanglement by introducing an optical Kerr nonlinear medium and a squeezed vacuum reservoir of the optomechanical cavity. By performing the displacement and squeezing transformations, the system can be reduced to a standard linearized optomechanical system with normalized driving detuning and linearized-coupling strength, in which the optical and mechanical modes are, respectively, coupled to an optical vacuum bath and a mechanical heat bath. We focus on the entanglement generation in the single stable regime of the system. By evaluating the steady-state logarithm negativity, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be enhanced within a wide range of the Kerr constant. In addition, the Kerr nonlinearity can extend the stable region, enabling considerable entanglement generation in the blue sideband-parameter region. We also investigate the dependence of the entanglement generation on the average thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath and the optical driving amplitude. It is found that the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity allows the generation of optomechanical entanglement even when the thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath is as high as 3000. Our findings will provide valuable insights into enhancing fragile quantum resources in quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple from the point of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that the process of chemical bond formation is accompanied by a marked increase in the quantum complexity of the electronic ground state. By studying the hydrogen dimer H$_{2}$ as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a pronounced peak that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This measure of quantum complexity, known as magic in the quantum information literature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using classical methods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or breaking are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This insight suggests a connection of quantum information measures to chemical reactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules as a quantum computational resource.</p>

            <p>Despite significant efforts, the realization of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithms has predominantly been confined to proof-of-principles, mainly due to the hardware noise. With fault-tolerant implementation being a long-term goal, going beyond small molecules with existing error mitigation (EM) techniques with current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices has been a challenge. That being said, statistical learning methods are promising approaches to learning the noise and its subsequent mitigation. We devise a graph neural network and regression-based machine learning (ML) architecture for practical realization of EM techniques for molecular Hamiltonian without the requirement of the exponential overhead. Given the short coherence time of the quantum hardware, the ML model is trained with either ideal or mitigated expectation values over a judiciously chosen ensemble of shallow sub-circuits adhering to the native hardware architecture. The hardware connectivity network is mapped to a directed graph which encodes the information of the native gate noise profile to generate the features for the neural network. The training data is generated on-the-fly during ansatz construction thus removing the computational overhead. We demonstrate orders of magnitude improvements in predicted energy over a few strongly correlated molecules.</p>

            <p>The ubiquitous noise in quantum system hinders the advancement of quantum information processing and has driven the emergence of different quantum error correction protocols. Among them, quantum error correction codes tailored for noise-biased qubits exhibit comparatively high error thresholds, making them a promising platform to achieve fault-tolerance. Nevertheless, their quantum operations are challenging and the demonstration of their performance beyond the fault-tolerant threshold remains incomplete. Here, we leverage Schrödinger cat states in scalable planar superconducting circuits to thoroughly characterize the high-fidelity single-qubit quantum operations on noise-biased qubits with systematic quantum tomography and benchmarking tools, demonstrating their state-of-the-art performance beyond the fault-tolerant threshold of the surface code. These results thus embody a transformative milestone in the exploration of quantum systems with structured noises. Notably, our framework is extensible to other structured-noise systems, paving the way for systematic characterization and validation of novel quantum platforms with structured noise.</p>

            <p>Experimental control over the strength and angular dependence of interactions between atoms is a key capability for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we use microwave dressing to manipulate and enhance Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble. By varying the cloud length relative to the blockade radius and measuring the statistics of the light retrieved from the ensemble, we demonstrate a clear enhancement of the interaction strength due to microwave dressing. These results are successfully captured by a theoretical model that accounts for the excitation dynamics, atomic density distribution, and the phase-matched retrieval efficiency. Our approach offers a versatile platform for further engineering interactions by exploiting additional features of the microwave fields, such as polarization and detuning, opening pathways for new quantum control strategies.</p>

            <p>We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG with substantial circumference on cylindrical geometry for the first time in the literature. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.</p>

We show these oscillations are suppressible via synergistic control of coherent driving, cavity parameters, and spin-spin couplings. In addition, we analyze the influence of various system and environmental parameters on the time evolution of ergotropy, revealing rich dynamical features. Our results offer new insights into the control of energy extraction in QBs and may inform future designs of practical battery architectures.</p>

            <p>We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET), designed for transporting quantum energy across space-time. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When both supplier and recipient operate within the same time frame, this is called Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET). A proof-of-concept was performed for the Ising model, utilizing quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3% to around 40%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across space-time.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing, sensing, and communication, however it is highly susceptible to decoherence. To address this, quantum optics has explored filtering techniques like photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. Here, we introduce a an entirely new approach to entanglement retrieval exploiting non-Hermitian systems. By employing an anti-parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network using Lanczos transformations, consistent with Wigner-Weisskopf theory. This scheme achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels while remaining robust against decoherence during propagation. Our work offers new insights into using non-Hermitian symmetries to address central challenges in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Assessing Teleportation of Logical Qubits in a Distributed Quantum Architecture under Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Stack, Ming Wang, Frank Mueller</p>
            <p>Quantum computing is facing challenges in terms of scaling to thousands of qubits and implementing quantum error correction (QEC). Scaling efforts focus on connecting multiple smaller quantum devices in a distributed manner while error correction, as a means to overcome noisy physical qubits, is being addressed by developing denser codes with protocols for logical qubits and logical quantum gates. Teleportation of quantum states becomes an important operation as it transfers states from one node to another node within a distributed device. For physical qubits, today's high quantum network noise rates prevent the teleportation of states with useful accuracy. By employing QEC, we show that logical qubits can be teleported between nodes under Surface Code and qLDPC encodings with very low logical error rates, even with network noise in near-term regimes. We use circuit-level simulations to assess physical and network noise regimes ranging from $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}$. This is a wider range than typically studied in circuit level simulations and understanding the behavior of QEC codes in these regimes is necessary for achieving accurate computation.</p>

            <p>Long-distance entanglement is pivotal for quantum communication, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Significant progresses have been made in extending the distribution distance of entangled photons, either in free space or fiber. For future quantum network applications, matter-based entanglement is more favorable since the capability of storage is essential for advanced applications. Extending entanglement distance for memory qubits was partially hindered by the mismatch of its photonic emission wavelength with the low-loss transmission window of optical fiber. By incorporating quantum frequency conversion, memory-memory entanglement has been successfully extended to several tens of kilometers. Here, we make a significant step further by reporting the entanglement between two atomic ensemble quantum memories over 420 km. We convert photons emitted from the memories to telecom S-band, which enable us to exploit the significantly low transmission loss in fiber (0.17 dB/km). We employ the DLCZ scheme for remote entanglement generation, and delicately stabilize the relative phase between the two memories by using fulltime far-off-resonant locking to reduce high-frequency noise and intermittent dual-band locking to compensate low-frequency drift jointly. We demonstrate that the memory-memory entangling probability beats the repeaterless channel capacity for direct entanglement distribution. Our experiment provides a testbed of studying quantum network applications from metropolitan scale to intercity scale.</p>

            <h2>Multilevel Quantum Rabi Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tabitha Doicin, Andrew D. Armour, Tommaso Tufarelli</p>
            <p>The quantum Rabi model, which describes the interaction between a simplified atom and a mode of the electromagnetic field, is a cornerstone of modern quantum optics. One of the key assumptions of the model is that the `atom' is a perfect two-level system. We explore what happens when one generalizes the atom to a multilevel system, with $m$ ground and $n$ excited states coupled to the same field. We focus on the case where the excited and ground states form distinct, well-separated, manifolds of near-degenerate levels (so that the spacing between the excited states on a given manifold is much less than the average spacing between the manifolds) and consider either uniform or random couplings between the individual ground and excited levels. We find that the system reduces approximately to a direct sum of Rabi models with a range of different couplings. Importantly, the strongest coupling is enhanced in a way that depends on the number of levels, for the simple case where $n=m$, the coupling scales with $n$ for uniform couplings and $2\sqrt{n}$ for random couplings (in the limit of large $n$). Our work thus suggests that multilevel Rabi systems could provide an attractive alternative route to accessing regimes of very strong coupling in light-matter systems.</p>

            <p>Molecular nanomagnets are quantum spin systems potentially serving as qudits for future quantum technologies thanks to their many accessible low-energy states. At low temperatures, the primary source of error in these systems is pure dephasing, caused by their interactions with the bath of surrounding nuclear spins degrees of freedom. Most importantly, as the system's dimensionality grows going from qubits to qudits, the control and mitigation of decoherence becomes more challenging. Here we analyze the characteristics of pure dephasing in molecular qudits under spin-echo sequences. We use a realistic description of their interaction with the bath, whose non-Markovian dynamics is accurately computed by the cluster correlation expansion technique. First, we demonstrate a necessary and sufficient condition to prevent the decay of coherence with time, also introducing a parameter to quantify the deviation from such ideal condition. We illustrate this with two paradigmatic systems: a single giant spin and a composite antiferromagnetic spin system. We then advance a proposal for optimized nanomagnets, identifying key ingredients for engineering robust qudits for quantum technologies.</p>

In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics.

            <p>We propose an innovative design for quantum batteries (QBs) that involves coupling two-level systems to a topological photonic waveguide. Employing the resolvent method, we analytically explore the thermodynamic performance of QBs. First, we demonstrate that in the long-time limit, only bound states significantly contribute to the stored energy of QBs. We observe that near-perfect energy transfer can occur in the topologically nontrivial phase. Moreover, the maximum stored energy exhibits singular behavior at the phase boundaries, where the number of bound states undergoes a transition. Second, when a quantum charger and a quantum battery are coupled at the same sublattice within a unit cell, the ergotropy becomes immune to dissipation at that location, facilitated by a dark state and a topologically robust dressed bound state. Third, we show that as dissipation intensifies along with the emergence of the quantum Zeno effect, the charging power of QBs experiences a temporary boost. Our findings offer valuable guidance for improving quantum battery performance in realistic conditions through structured reservoir engineering.</p>

            <p>Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities injected into a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, using two broad Feshbach resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. For attractive impurity-bath interactions, the impurity spectrum features a single branch, which away from the resonance corresponds to a well-defined attractive polaron; near the resonance we observe dramatic broadening of this branch, suggesting a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. For repulsive impurity-bath interactions, the spectrum features two branches: the attractive branch that is dominated by excitations with energy close to that of the Feshbach dimer, but has a many-body character, and the repulsive polaron branch. Our measurements show that the behavior of impurities in weakly interacting baths is remarkably universal, controlled only by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction parameter.</p>

            <p>SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>Quantum multiparameter metrology is hindered by incompatibility issues, such as finding a single probe state (probe incompatibility) and a single measurement (measurement incompatibility) optimal for all parameters. The simultaneous estimation of phase shift and loss in a single optical mode is a paradigmatic multiparameter metrological problem in which such tradeoffs are present. We consider two settings: single-mode or two-mode probes (with a reference lossless mode), and for each setting we consider either Gaussian states or arbitrary quantum states of light restricted only by a maximal number of photons allowed. We find numerically that, as the number of photons increases, there are quantum states of light for which probe incompatibility disappears both in the single- and two-mode scenarios. On the other hand, for Gaussian states, probe incompatibility is present in the single-mode case and may be removed only in the two-mode setting thanks to the entanglement with the reference mode. Finally, we provide strong arguments that the fundamental incompatibility aspect of the model is measurement incompatibility, which persists for all the scenarios considered, and unlike probe-incompatibility cannot be overcome even in the large photon number limit.</p>

The experiment performs a partial measurement on a qubit. It uses the result of that measurement to move an estimated 10e-12 kg of mass in one of two locations separated by approximately 1 mm. In standard quantum mechanics, the partial measurement leaves the system in an improper mixture, a state that appears probabilistic but retains quantum coherence. This is mathematically indistinguishable from a proper mixture, where the state has genuinely collapsed. According to Penrose's theory, improper mixtures can lead to gravitationally induced collapse. Results of our experiment show a change in the circuit evolution that is consistent with wavefunction collapse driven by such an improper mixture. The experiment is performed on an IBM Eagle 127-qubit processor using IBM's programming framework Qiskit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoham Jacoby, Yotam Vaknin, Alex Retzker, Arne L. Grimsmo</p>
            <p>Erasure qubits constitute a promising approach for tackling the daunting resources required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. By heralding erasure errors, both the error-correction threshold and the sub-threshold scaling of the logical error rate are significantly improved. While previous research has focused primarily on fault-tolerant quantum memories, we extend this investigation to magic state injection--a critical yet resource-intensive component of fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that, after postselecting on erasures, the logical error rate of the injected magic state is set by the residual Pauli error, while the space-time overhead is only marginally increased as compared to non-erasure qubits with a similar noise strength. These conclusions hold both for injection into the surface code, and for injection and cultivation on the color code. For the former, we show that most of the gains can be achieved by using just three strategically placed erasure qubits in the surface code patch, independent of the patch size. For the latter, in contrast, it is beneficial to have all the qubits in the cultivation patch be erasure qubits. Our results for cultivation suggest that algorithmically relevant logical error rates may be within reach without magic state distillation for erasure rates $\lesssim 4\times 10^{-3}$ and residual Pauli error rates $\sim 10^{-4}$.</p>

            <p>A central roadblock in the realization of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum hardware is the high overhead associated with measurement repetitions, which hampers the computation of complex problems, such as the simulation of mid- and large-sized molecules. In this work, we propose a novel measurement protocol which relies on computing an approximation of the Hamiltonian expectation value. The method involves measuring cheap grouped operators directly and estimating the residual elements through iterative measurements of new grouped operators in different bases, with the process being truncated at a certain stage. The measured elements comprehend the operators defined by the Hard-Core Bosonic approximation, which encode electron-pair annihilation and creation operators. These can be easily decomposed into three self-commuting groups which can be measured simultaneously. Applied to molecular systems, the method achieves a reduction of 30% to 80% in the number of measurement and gates depth in the measuring circuits compared to state-of-the-art methods. This provides a scalable and cheap measurement protocol, advancing the application of variational approaches for simulating physical systems.</p>

ALD process control is key in several technological applications such as spintronics, catalysis and renewable energy storage. We first derive a large ab-initio model of the precursor molecule approaching the infinite hydroxylated silicon (100) surface. In particular, we optimize geometry in three configurations: reactants, transition state and products. Subsequently, we derive an effective small cluster model for each state. Atomic valence active space (AVAS) transformation is then performed on these small clusters, leading to an effective qubit Hamiltonian, which is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We study the convergence of the reaction activation barrier with respect to the active space size and benchmark quantum calculations on a noiseless emulator and on an emulator representing a carbon nanotube qubit architecture, including an appropriate noise model and post-selection error mitigation. These calculations reveal an excellent agreement between the two emulation modes.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-fan Qi</p>
            <p>Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states with broad applications in quantum information processing and metrology. In this work, we propose a two-mode squeezing scheme within a hybrid three-mode cavity optomechanical system, wherein a mechanical resonator is coupled to two microwave (or optical) photon modes. By applying and modulating strong driving pulses to the photon modes, we construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes two-photon squeezing mediated by the mechanical mode. This effective Hamiltonian is validated through the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation within the open-quantum-system framework. Our analysis reveals that stable two-mode squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even in unstable system dynamics. Moreover, the squeezing level can surpass the maximum achievable under stable system conditions. Our work provides an extendable approach for generating two-mode squeezed states between indirectly coupled Gaussian modes.</p>

            <h2>Hong-Ou-Mandel effect with two frequency-entangled photons of vastly different color</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Mann, Helen M. Chrzanowski, Felipe Gewers, Marlon Placke, Sven Ramelow</p>
            <p>In the original Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment -- when two identical photons are incident upon the input ports of a balanced beam-splitter -- they coalesce, always leaving via the same output port. It is often interpreted that this interference arises due to the indistinguishability of the single photons; the situation, however, is often more nuanced. Here, we demonstrate an analog of HOM interference between two photons of completely different color. To do so, we utilize a quantum frequency converter based on sum- and difference-frequency generation as an `active' beam-splitter -- coupling frequency-entangled red and telecom single photons with an octave-spanning energy difference of 282 THz. This work presents the first demonstration of HOM interference between two single photons of distinctly different color, deepening our understanding of what underlies quantum interference. It also suggests a novel approach to interfacing photonic qubits in heterogeneous quantum systems where frequency conversion and quantum interference are unified.</p>

            <h2>Squeezing light with optomechanical and spin-light quantum interfaces</h2>

            <p>We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</p>

            <p>We introduce an effective modes formalism to describe how the quasi-continuum of photonic modes in an optical cavity effectively behaves in the strong light-matter coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. By expressing these effective modes, we are able to solve current mysteries in the field, leveraging the formalism and intuition gained in this framework. Furthermore, we show that the mode volumes of these effective modes are independent of the physical area of the Fabry-Pérot cavity mirrors. These results also allow us to explain the recently discovered experimental phenomenon in vibrational polaritons, where chemical reactivities can only be modified if the molecules are coupled in resonance to the normal-incidence mode in a Fabry-Pérot cavity.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the stationary properties of a spin-1/2 impurity immersed in a one-dimensional confined Bose gas. In particular, we consider coherently coupled spin states with an external field, where only one spin component interacts with the bath, enabling light dressing of the impurity and spin-dependent bath-impurity interactions. Through detailed comparisons with ab-initio many-body simulations, we demonstrate that the composite system is accurately described by a simplified effective Hamiltonian. The latter builds upon previously developed effective potential approaches in the absence of light dressing. It can be used to extract the impurity energy, residue, effective mass, and anharmonicity induced by the phononic dressing. Light-dressing is shown to increase the polaron residue, undressing the impurity from phononic excitations because of strong spin coupling. For strong repulsions-previously shown to trigger dynamical Bose polaron decay (a phenomenon called temporal orthogonality catastrophe), it is explained that strong light-dressing stabilizes a repulsive polaron-dressed state. Our results establish the effective Hamiltonian framework as a powerful tool for exploring strongly interacting polaronic systems and corroborating forthcoming experimental realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Izadyari, Onur Pusuluk, Kanu Sinha, Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu</p>
            <p>We investigate the generation of steady-state entanglement between two atoms resulting from the fluctuation-mediated Casimir-Polder (CP) interactions near a surface. Starting with an initially separable state of the atoms, we analyze the atom-atom entanglement dynamics for atoms placed at distances in the range of $\sim25$ nm away from a planar medium, examining the effect of medium properties and geometrical configuration of the atomic dipoles. We show that perfectly conducting and superconducting surfaces yield an optimal steady-state concurrence value of approximately 0.5. Furthermore, although the generated entanglement decreases with medium losses for a metal surface, we identify an optimal distance from the metal surface that assists in entanglement generation by the surface. While fluctuation-mediated interactions are typically considered detrimental to the coherence of quantum systems at nanoscales, our results demonstrate a mechanism for leveraging such interactions for entanglement generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayakrishnan M. P. Nair, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>Spin squeezing, a form of many-body entanglement, is a crucial resource in quantum metrology and information processing. While experimentally viable protocols for generating stable spin squeezing have been proposed in quantum optics setups, there is growing interest in quantum hybrid solid-state systems as alternative platforms for both engineering and exploring many-body quantum phenomena. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate long-lived spin squeezing in an ensemble of solid-state qubits interacting with electromagnetic noise emitted by a squeezed solid-state bath. We identify the conditions under which quantum correlations within the bath can be transferred to the qubit array, driving it into an entangled state independently of its initial configuration. To assess the experimental feasibility of our approach, we analyze the dynamics of an array of solid-state spin defects coupled to a common ferromagnetic bath, which is driven into a non-equilibrium squeezed state through its interaction with a surface acoustic wave mode. Our results demonstrate that the ensemble can exhibit steady-state spin squeezing under suitable conditions, opening new pathways for the generation of robust many-body entanglement in solid-state spin ensembles.</p>

            <p>Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p>The correlations of certain entangled states can be perfectly simulated classically via a local model. Hence such states are termed Bell local, as they cannot lead to Bell inequality violation. Here, we show that Bell nonlocality can nevertheless be activated for certain Bell-local states via a catalytic process. Specifically, we present a protocol where a Bell-local state, combined with a catalyst, is transformed into a Bell-nonlocal state while the catalyst is returned exactly in its initial state. Importantly, this transformation is deterministic and based only on local operations. Moreover, this procedure is possible even when the state of the catalyst is itself Bell local, demonstrating a new form of superactivation of Bell nonlocality, as well as an interesting form of quantum catalysis. On the technical level, our main tool is a formal connection between catalytic activation and many-copy activation, which is of independent interest.</p>

This system is characterized by unbalanced left/right nearest-neighbor hopping and reciprocal second-neighbor interactions in both hopping directions. The interplay between the unbalanced hopping amplitudes and the waveguide setup results in Non-Hermitian Bloch oscillations, where energy transport is either amplified or dissipated at specific locations, depending on the relative strengths of the left and right hopping terms. We demonstrate that by applying an appropriate non-unitary transformation, the original system can be mapped into an equivalent reciprocalwaveguide with Hermitian dynamics.

            <p>We propose a series of dissipation-assisted entanglement generation protocols that can be implemented on a trapped-ion quantum simulator. Our approach builds on the single-site molecular electron transfer (ET) model recently realized in the experiment [So et al. Sci. Adv. 10, eads8011 (2024)]. This model leverages spin-dependent boson displacement and dissipation controlled by sympathetic cooling. We show that, when coupled to external degrees of freedom, the ET model can be used as a dissipative quantum control mechanism, enabling the precise tailoring of both spin and phonon steady state of a target sub-system. We derive simplified analytical formalisms that offer intuitive insights into the dissipative dynamics. Using realistic interactions in a trapped-ion system, we develop a protocol for generating $N$-qubit and $N$-boson $W$ states. Additionally, we generalize this protocol to realize generic $N$-qubit Dicke states with tunable excitation numbers. Finally, we outline a realistic experimental setup to implement our schemes in the presence of noise sources.</p>

We uncover the emergence of Floquet scarring states, a class of quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) states that defy random thermalization. The underlying physical mechanism is identified to be the Floquet resonances between these degenerate Fock bases that can be connected by one hopping process. It is the first-order hopping perturbation effect. Utilizing the degenerate Floquet perturbation theory, we derive the exact conditions under which the exotic QMBS states emerge. Phenomena such as quantum revivals and subharmonic responses are also studied.

            <h2>Numerical Framework for Multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings Models Incorporating the Modified Langevin Noise Formalism: Non-Markovian Analysis of Atom-Field Interactions in Dissipative Electromagnetic Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunwoo Choi, Weng Cho Chew, Dong-Yeop Na</p>
            <p>We present a novel numerical framework that integrates the modified Langevin noise formalism into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models, enabling a first-principles, non-Markovian analysis of atom-field interactions in dissipative electromagnetic (EM) environments that account for both radiative losses and absorptive dissipation in lossy dielectric media (or satisfying general inhomogeneous causal media exhibiting both dispersion and absorption effects). In the modified Langevin noise formalism, the boundary- and medium-assisted (BA and MA) fields, which constitute a continuum set of EM modes in dissipative EM environments, are numerically obtained using the finite-element method (FEM). Specifically, BA field modes are extracted by solving plane-wave scattering problems, while MA field modes are determined through point-source radiation problems. These numerically obtained BA and MA field modes are then incorporated into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models such that the coupling strength between atoms and BA-MA field modes can be calculated for the study of atom-field interactions in dissipative EM environments. The proposed methodology captures non-Markovian atomic dynamics that cannot be described by traditional quantum master equations under the Markovian approximation. To validate the accuracy of the proposed numerical framework, we present four numerical examples: (i) a two-level system (TLS) in a perfect electric conductor (PEC) half-space; (ii) dissipative cavity electrodynamics with two limiting cases approaching spontaneous emission in free space and ideal Rabi oscillations; (iii) super-radiance in TLS arrays; and (iv) entanglement sudden death of two TLSs inside dissipative cavities. The proposed methodology can serve as a ground-truth numerical simulator for studying atom-field interactions in general dissipative EM environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum networking technologies use spin qubits and their interface to single photons as core components of a network node. This necessitates the ability to co-design the magnetic- and optical-dipole response of a quantum system. These properties are notoriously difficult to design in many solid-state systems, where spin-orbit coupling and the crystalline environment for each qubit create inhomogeneity of electronic g-factors and optically active states. Here, we show that GaAs quantum dots (QDs) obtained via the quasi-strain-free local droplet etching epitaxy growth method provide spin and optical properties predictable from assuming the highest possible QD symmetry. Our measurements of electron and hole g-tensors and of transition dipole moment orientations for charged excitons agree with our predictions from a multiband k.p simulation constrained only by a single atomic-force-microscopy reconstruction of QD morphology. This agreement is verified across multiple wavelength-specific growth runs at different facilities within the range of 730 nm to 790 nm for the exciton emission. Remarkably, our measurements and simulations track the in-plane electron g-factors through a zero-crossing from -0.1 to 0.3 and linear optical dipole moment orientations fully determined by an external magnetic field. The robustness of our results demonstrates the capability to design - prior to growth - the properties of a spin qubit and its tunable optical interface best adapted to a target magnetic and photonic environment with direct application for high-quality spin-photon entanglement.</p>

Although studied in various systems both in theory and experiment, the redirection of single photons with many output ports, compatible with large-scale photonic circuits, still needs to be explored.

The Rydberg component of the stored photon is changed using a stimulated Raman transition with a specific intermediate state. By adjusting the direction of the retrieval laser, we can redirect the emitted photon into a rich variety of alternative modes. Building upon this scheme, we propose a quantum routing of single photons with \textit{N} output channels and unity routing efficiency. In addition, the protocol reduces the effect of motional dephasing increasing the photon lifetime to $>10~\mu$s ($>20$ times photon processing time), enabling functional quantum devices based on Rydberg polaritons.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast all-optical Floquet engineering. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%.

            <p>The confluence of Non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding edge dislocations in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. These NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states as the system arrives at the shore of fostering exceptional points in the Brillouin zone under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</p>

            <p>In the framework of the hybrid quantum-classical variational cluster approach (VCA) to strongly correlated electron systems one of the goals of a quantum subroutine is to find single-particle correlation functions of lattice fermions in polynomial time. Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our new algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.</p>

The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori</p>
            <p>It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe</p>
            <p>We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</p>

            <h2>Multiparticle quantum plasmonics: fundamentals and applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyuan Hong</p>
            <p>Quantum plasmonics explores how light interacts with collective charge oscillations at metal-dielectric interfaces, enabling strong confinement and enhanced quantum effects at the nanoscale. While traditional quantum optics focuses on single photons, this thesis explores an intermediate regime - multiparticle quantum optics - where classical light, analyzed using photon-number-resolving detection and projective measurements, reveals nontrivial quantum correlations. We begin by establishing the theoretical foundation of multiparticle quantum plasmonics, introducing key concepts like photon-plasmon interactions, coherence, and statistical fluctuations. The first study shows that multiparticle scattering can alter quantum statistics in plasmonic systems, offering new control over fluctuations. The second reveals nonclassical near-field plasmon dynamics, showing how quantum coherence emerges from bosonic and fermionic contributions in subsystems. The third study presents a quantum plasmonic sensing method, using conditional detection to boost signal-to-noise ratio and improve phase estimation. The final study extends this approach to quantum imaging with natural light: by isolating multiphoton correlations from thermal light via photon-number-resolving detection and a single-pixel protocol, we enhance image contrast under noisy conditions. These results show that multiparticle interactions can control quantum statistical properties, even in classical fields. By bridging theory and application, this thesis advances quantum plasmonics and highlights the potential of multiphoton methods in imaging, sensing, and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Dynamics from Flows of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Hahn, David M. Long, Marin Bukov, Anushya Chandran</p>
            <p>Analytical treatments of far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics are few, even in well-thermalizing systems. The celebrated eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a post hoc ansatz for the matrix elements of observables in the eigenbasis of a thermalizing Hamiltonian, given various response functions of those observables as input. However, the ETH cannot predict these response functions. We introduce a procedure, dubbed the statistical Jacobi approximation (SJA), to update the ETH ansatz after a perturbation to the Hamiltonian and predict perturbed response functions. The Jacobi algorithm diagonalizes the perturbation through a sequence of two-level rotations. The SJA implements these rotations statistically assuming the ETH throughout the diagonalization procedure, and generates integrodifferential flow equations for various form factors in the ETH ansatz. We approximately solve these flow equations for certain classes of observables, and predict both quench dynamics and autocorrelators in the thermal state of the perturbed Hamiltonian. The predicted dynamics compare well to exact numerics in both random matrix models and one-dimensional spin chains.</p>

            <h2>Double-bracket algorithm for quantum signal processing without post-selection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yudai Suzuki, Bi Hong Tiang, Jeongrak Son, Nelly H. Y. Ng, Zoë Holmes, Marek Gluza</p>
            <p>Quantum signal processing (QSP), a framework for implementing matrix-valued polynomials, is a fundamental primitive in various quantum algorithms. Despite its versatility, a potentially underappreciated challenge is that all systematic protocols for implementing QSP rely on post-selection. This can impose prohibitive costs for tasks when amplitude amplification cannot sufficiently improve the success probability. For example, in the context of ground-state preparation, this occurs when using a too poor initial state. In this work, we introduce a new formula for implementing QSP transformations of Hermitian matrices, which requires neither auxiliary qubits nor post-selection. Rather, using approximation to the exact unitary synthesis, we leverage the theory of the double-bracket quantum algorithms to provide a new quantum algorithm for QSP, termed Double-Bracket QSP (DB-QSP). The algorithm requires the energy and energetic variance of the state to be measured at each step and has a recursive structure, which leads to circuit depths that can grow super exponentially with the degree of the polynomial. With these strengths and caveats in mind, DB-QSP should be viewed as complementing the established QSP toolkit. In particular, DB-QSP can deterministically implement low-degree polynomials to "warm start" QSP methods involving post-selection.</p>

            <h2>Fault-tolerant correction-ready encoding of the [[7,1,3]] Steane code on a 2D grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Rodriguez-Blanco, Ho Nam Nguyen, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>Practical quantum computation heavily relies on the ability to perform quantum error correction in a fault-tolerant manner. Fault-tolerant encoding is a critical first step, and careful consideration of the error correction cycle that follows is essential for ensuring the encoding's effectiveness and compatibility. In this work, we investigate various correction-ready encoding methods to fault-tolerantly prepare the zero-logical state of the [[7,1,3]] Steane code on a 2D grid. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that parity-check encoding with a few Flag-Bridge qubits outperforms verification-based encoding by achieving lower error rates and allowing flexible tuning of the performance-efficiency trade-off. Additionally, parity-check approach enables a compact hybrid protocol that combines encoding and error correction, capable of matching the performance of a standalone error correction protocol with perfect encoding. Surprisingly, compared to the resource-intensive Steane error correction, this low-overhead method still offers a practical advantage in noisy settings. These findings highlight the approach with Flag-Bridge qubits as a robust and adaptable solution for noisy near-term quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Resetting Protocols Based on Synchronizing Words</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jędrzej Stempin, Jan Wójcik, Andrzej Grudka, Marcin Karczewski, Paweł Kurzyński, Antoni Wójcik</p>
            <p>Resetting a system's state plays a fundamental role in physics, engineering, computer science, and many other fields. Here we focus on a method originally proposed in automata theory. The state of an automaton evolves according to a set of rules. These rules form an alphabet, and one can apply these rules one after another. Such a sequence of rules is known as a word. Some particular words, known as synchronizing words, enable a system to evolve into a predetermined state regardless of its initial configuration. This process, which is inherently irreversible, appears at first glance to be incompatible with the unitarity of quantum mechanics. Unitary evolution preserves information, hence forbids such classical resetting to a predetermined state. In this work, we introduce a novel resetting protocol based on quantum-synchronizing words by incorporating auxiliary qubits whose states encode rules of the automaton's alphabet. We further propose a quantum circuit that realizes this protocol and can be implemented on a quantum computer. Additionally, we establish a connection between this approach and Kraus channels, showing that quantum synchronizing words can be achieved without explicit reference to the states of ancillary qubits. Our results bridge classical and quantum notions of synchronizing words, shedding light on the interplay between quantum information processing and non-unitary dynamics.</p>

            <p>Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot based encodings. Moreover, we show the first experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.</p>

            <p>This work investigates the impact of time rescaling on the performance of Feedback Quantum Algorithms (FQA) and their variant for optimization tasks, FALQON. We introduce TR-FQA and TR-FALQON, time-rescaled versions of FQA and FALQON, respectively. The method is applied to two representative problems: the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem and ground-state preparation in the ANNNI quantum many-body model. The results show that TR-FALQON accelerates convergence to the optimal solution in the early layers of the circuit, significantly outperforming its standard counterpart in shallow-depth regimes. In the context of state preparation, TR-FQA demonstrates superior convergence, reducing the required circuit depth by several hundred layers. These findings highlight the potential of time rescaling as a strategy to enhance algorithmic performance on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum light sources with configurable photon lifetimes are essential for large-scale quantum circuits, enabling applications in programmable quantum computing, various quantum key distribution protocols, and quantum tomography techniques. However, the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and photon lifetime imposes significant challenges on the design of high-performance large configurable lifetime quantum light sources. Here, we report on such chip-scale quantum light sources by harnessing the unique feature of parity-time (PT) symmetry. The core design centers on employing PT-symmetric coupling between two microresonators of distinct circumferences, enabling broad-range and selective tuning of intracavity photon density of states. By controlling the alignment between resonators, we achieved a 38-fold photon lifetime tuning range (4 ~ 158 ps), with the shortest lifetimes near the exceptional points of the PT-symmetric systems. The device generates energy-time entangled photon pairs with 87.1 +- 1.1% interference visibility and a heralded second-order autocorrelation of g_h^((2) ) (0)= 0.069 +- 0.001. Our work highlights the potential of PT symmetry for advanced quantum applications, including high-speed communication and programmable quantum computing, quantum coherent tomography, and beyond.</p>

While the applicability of QKD can be readily increased with the use of intermediary trusted nodes, this adds additional privacy requirements on third parties.

In particular, we provide several bounds to estimate the symmetric tensor rank and geometric measure of entanglement. Additionally, we identify multipartite symmetric states whose entanglement outperforms that of previously known candidates for maximally entangled symmetric states.

            <p>Quantum timeless approaches solve the problem of time by recovering the usual unitary evolution of quantum theory relative to a clock in a stationary quantum Universe. For some Hamiltonians of the Universe, such as those including an interaction term with the clock, the dynamics is substantially altered and can be non-unitary. This work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the relative dynamics to be unitary and finds the general form of the unitary evolution operator. A physical interpretation of these conditions is given in terms of the clock's rate. Unitary dynamics is associated with rates that are constant in time and independent of the clock's internal structure.</p>

            <p>We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while reaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013116 (2021).</p>

It is highly flexible, allowing for the in situ characterization of FLO-averaged gate-dependent noise under natural assumptions on a family of continuously parameterized one- and two-qubit gates. We rigorously show that our protocol has an efficient sampling complexity, owing in-part to useful properties of the Kravchuk transformations that feature in our analysis. We support our conclusions with numerical results. As FLO circuits become universal with access to certain resource states, we expect our results to inform noise characterization and error mitigation techniques on universal quantum computing architectures which naturally admit a fermionic description.</p>

            <p>It is often claimed that adding a qubit to a black hole requires energy $\Delta E \geq T_H \log 2$ so that the extra Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can accommodate the qubit. In this essay, we explain how the recently discovered phenomenon of black hole decoherence allows quantum information to be teleported into a black hole, with arbitrarily small energy cost. The generalized second law is not violated and there is no conflict with unitarity because the teleportation creates new entanglement, analogous to Hawking radiation, between the black hole interior and exterior. In accordance with Landauer's principle, a nonzero minimum energy cost only appears when there is a net erasure of information and noise from the exterior or, equivalently, when ``zerobits'' are sent into the black hole.</p>

            <p>Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes with asymptotically non-zero rates are prominent candidates for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation, primarily due to their syndrome-measurement circuit's low operational depth. Numerous studies advocate for the necessity of fast decoders to fully harness the capabilities of QLDPC codes, thus driving the focus towards designing low-complexity iterative decoders. However, empirical investigations indicate that such iterative decoders are susceptible to having a high error floor while decoding QLDPC codes. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the decoding failures of the \emph{hypergraph-product} and \emph{lifted-product} codes and to design decoders that mitigate these failures, thus achieving a reduced error floor. The suboptimal performance of these codes can predominantly be ascribed to two structural phenomena: (1) stabilizer-induced trapping sets, which are subgraphs formed by stabilizers, and (2) classical trapping sets, which originate from the classical codes utilized in the construction of hypergraph-product and lifted-product codes. The dynamics of stabilizer-induced trapping sets is examined and a straightforward modification of iterative decoders is proposed to circumvent these trapping sets. Moreover, this work proposes a systematic methodology for designing decoders that can circumvent classical trapping sets in both hypergraph product and lifted product codes, from decoders capable of avoiding their trapping set in the parent classical LDPC code. When decoders that can avoid stabilizer-induced trapping sets are run in parallel with those that can mitigate the effect of classical TS, the logical error rate improves significantly in the error-floor region.</p>

            <p>A critical problem in the financial world deals with the management of risk, from regulatory risk to portfolio risk. Many such problems involve the analysis of securities modelled by complex dynamics that cannot be captured analytically, and hence rely on numerical techniques that simulate the stochastic nature of the underlying variables. These techniques may be computationally difficult or demanding. Hence, improving these methods offers a variety of opportunities for quantum algorithms. In this work, we study the problem of Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) which has significant importance in the valuation of derivative portfolios. As a variant, we also consider the problem of pricing a portfolio of many different financial options. We propose quantum algorithms that accelerate statistical sampling processes to approximate the price of the multi-option portfolio and the CVA under different measures of dispersion. Technically, our algorithms are based on enhancing the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms by Montanaro with an unbiased version of quantum amplitude estimation. We analyse the conditions under which we may employ these techniques and demonstrate the application of QMC techniques on CVA approximation when particular bounds for the variance of CVA are known.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Setiawan, Alexander V. Gramolin, Elisha S. Matekole, Hari Krovi, Jacob M. Taylor</p>
            <p>Accurate modeling of noise in realistic quantum processors is critical for constructing fault-tolerant quantum computers. While a full simulation of actual noisy quantum circuits provides information about correlated noise among all qubits and is therefore accurate, it is, however, computationally expensive as it requires resources that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. We propose an efficient systematic construction of approximate noise channels, where their accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating noise components with higher qubit-qubit correlation degree. To formulate such approximate channels, we first present a method, dubbed the cluster expansion approach, to decompose the Lindbladian generator of an actual noise channel into components based on interqubit correlation degree. We generate a $k$-th order approximate noise channel by truncating the cluster expansion and incorporating noise components with correlations up to the $k$-th degree. We require that the approximate noise channels must be accurate and also ``honest", i.e., the actual errors are not underestimated in our physical models. As an example application, we apply our method to model noise in a three-qubit quantum processor that stabilizes a [[2,0,2]] codeword, which is one of the four Bell states. We find that, for realistic noise strength typical for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits coupled via always-on static interactions, correlated noise beyond two-qubit correlation can significantly affect the code simulation accuracy. Since our approach provides a systematic characterization of multi-qubit noise correlations, it enables the potential for accurate, honest and scalable approximations to simulate large numbers of qubits from full modeling or experimental characterizations of small enough quantum subsystems, which are efficient but still retain essential noise features of the entire device.</p>
